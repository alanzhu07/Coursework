Privacy Policy Thank you for visiting the United States Patent and Trademark Office website and reviewing our privacy policy . Our privacy policy is simple : we collect no personal information about you when you visit our website unless you choose to provide that information to us . Submitting personal information is voluntary . When you voluntarily submit information , it constitutes your consent to the use of the information for the purpose ( s ) stated at the time of collection . See the Privacy Act of 1974 ( P.L. 93-579 ) for more information on your rights under the Privacy Act . Except for the purposes described below , no other attempts are made to identify individual users while on the USPTO websites . Here is how we handle information about your visit to our website :  The USPTO Web servers automatically collect and save the default information customarily logged by Web server software . Specifically , the date and time , the originating IP address , the object requested , and the completion status of the request is collected and saved for each http request received by the server . We also use an authorized Google Analytics agent to collect comparable information on our behalf . On a monthly or more frequent basis , we review this information to determine the traffic through the servers in hits , the number of pages served , and the level of demand for pages of interest . We may also analyze accesses to particular pages to determine U.S. versus non-U.S. use , government agency versus private use , and other statistics that may be of value to us in establishing priorities and allocating resources in order to better accomplish our dissemination mission . Analysis of this information may also help identify problem areas of the website or to improve overall service . Information is retained as long as necessary to perform useful analysis . For site security purposes and to ensure that USPTO Web services remain available to all users , USPTO monitors network traffic to identify unauthorized attempts to upload or change information or otherwise cause damage . Unauthorized attempts to upload information or change information on this service are strictly prohibited and subject to prosecution under the Computer Fraud and Abuse Act of 1986 and Title 18 U.S.C . Sec. 1001 and 1030 . Information also may be used for authorized law enforcement investigations . The Office of Management and Budget Memorandum M-10-22 , Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technologies defines conditions under which Federal agencies may use session and persistent cookies , and categorizes them in tiers to identify their characteristics . You may control permissions for cookies on this or any other website by adjusting your individual browser settings for customized privacy protection see http : //www.usa.gov/optout_instructions.shtml for helpful guidance . Session cookies Session cookies are also known as memory-resident cookies . These cookies are not stored on your computer 's hard drive , and are removed when you complete your session or exit the site . We use session cookies for some applications to improve their usability and ensure session integrity . No personal information is gathered . USPTO sites and applications that use Tier 1 session cookies include the subscription center and the customer satisfaction survey . Our site-wide search is conducted through USA.gov , an external site , which also uses a session cookie . Persistent cookies Persistent cookies remain on your computer 's hard drive after you complete an activity . On www.uspto.gov , we use Tier 2 persistent cookies to help us recognize new and returning visitors , but no personally-identifiable information is gathered . If you block a persistent cookie , you are not prevented from using the USPTO website in any way . We use persistent cookies in association with an authorized customer satisfaction survey conducted by a third party , ForeSee ResultsTM . If you are randomly selected to participate in this survey , a persistent cookie is stored on your computer 's hard drive for 90 days to preclude a new invitation during that time .

If you choose to provide us with personal information in e-mail , we use that information to respond to your message and to help us get you the information you have requested . We do not collect personal information for any purpose other than to respond to you . We only share the information you give us with another government agency if your inquiry relates to that agency , or as otherwise required by law . Moreover , we do not store any personal information independent of the e-mail message , create individual profiles with the information you provide , or give it to any private organizations . We do not collect information for commercial marketing . The USPTO may offer the use of third-party e-mail services as a convenience . If you choose to use such a service , information about you may be independently collected by the third party . USPTO will clearly note this distinction wherever the service is offered on its website and remind you that your participation is voluntary . If you choose to submit a blog comment , only personal information that you voluntarily provide as part of the comment will be revealed . All comments are moderated , and only those that comply with USPTO policy will be publicly posted . The USPTO will not edit or alter individual comments . If you simply visit a blog page , your visit will be recorded for statistical purposes , as for other areas of the website .

This randomized survey is based on the American Customer Satisfaction Index ( ACSI ) and your participation is voluntary .

As discussed below , when you download and install Medscape Mobile onto your mobile device , we assign a random number to your installation , and that random number is used in a manner similar to our use of cookies . Most browser software can be set to reject all cookies . If your browser is set to reject cookies , websites that are cookie-enabled will not recognize you when you return to the website , and some website functionality may be lost . The Help section of your browser will tell you about your options for managing your cookies . We may use web beacons and cookies to serve you targeted advertisements when you visit other websites owned and operated by WebMD . We may also use web beacons to track who has opened our emails . Web beacons are tiny graphic image files , embedded in a website page that notify the home server ( which can belong to the host website , a network advertiser , or some other third party ) on a non-personally identifiable basis that some interaction has taken place . This notice may also result in a cookie being set on your device , as described above . WebMD contracts with third parties whose web beacons may be placed on the WebMD Sites to assist WebMD in targeting its advertising that is served to you on websites that are not owned and operated by WebMD . These web beacons place cookies on your browser in order to enable these third parties to collect non-personally identifiable information about you . These third parties have agreed not to use any non-personally identifiable information that they may collect through their use of these cookies except to deliver advertisements on our behalf . If your browser is set to reject cookies , this non-personally identifiable information will not be sent to these third parties . Also , in connection with its sale of advertising , WebMD may allow a third party to place a cookie on your browser to enable advertisers to recognize your browser on a non-personally identifiable basis in order to deliver an advertisement to you when you visit a WebMD Site . These advertisers are not permitted to collect any information based on your visits to a WebMD Site . Sponsors or advertisers that market to you through our Services may use their own cookies , web beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served to you . Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve these ads and to monitor users ' responses to ads , and these companies ( " Ad Servers " ) may also collect non-personally identifiable information through the use of cookies or web beacons . We do not control these third parties ' use of cookies or web beacons , or how they manage the non-personally identifiable information they gather through them . However , we do require sponsors , advertisers and Ad Servers who we authorize to collect cookie or web beacon information through the Services to agree that they will not collect any personally identifiable information about you from your use of the Services through these means . Further , they have agreed that they will not link any non-personal cookie or web beacon information that they collect from your use of the Services to personally identifiable information that they or others collect in other ways or from other websites except as may be described in connection with a particular program or except as you may have agreed with the third party placing the cookie or web beacon . Certain Ad Servers and third party firms that facilitate the serving of advertisements based on your browsing activities on the Internet allow you to prevent them from collecting data or serving advertisements through the use of their cookies . In order to do so , you must opt-out of such data collection with each individual website . Currently , you can opt-out of Cookies for several Ad Servers and marketing analytics firms by visiting the Network Advertising Initiative gateway opt-out website . This website will also allow you to review the privacy policies of these Ad Servers and marketing analytics firms . The websites on the WebMD Health Professional Network do not respond to web browser " do not track " signals . When you download and install Medscape Mobile onto your mobile device , we assign a random number to your installation . We can not use this number to identify you personally , and we can not identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of Medscape Mobile . We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of cookies as described in this Privacy Policy . Unlike cookies , the random number is assigned to your installation of Medscape Mobile itself and not a browser , because Medscape Mobile does not work through your browser . Therefore the random number can not be removed through your device settings . If you do not want us to use the random number for purposes similar to the purposes for which we use cookies , as described in this Privacy Policy , please do not use Medscape Mobile . Also , if you do become a registered user of Medscape Mobile , we will use your registration information as described in this Privacy Policy to provide the Services to you through Medscape Mobile . We do not obtain any information about your mobile device ( through the random number , your registration information or otherwise ) other than its brand , make and model and the type of operating software that it uses . We are committed to protecting the privacy of children . The Professional Sites and Services are designed and intended for use by adults , and are not intended for , nor designed to be used by children under the age of 18 . We do not collect personally identifiable information from any person we know is under the age of 18 . In this section of our Privacy Policy , we identify the ways we may use information about you that we have collected . In general , the personally identifiable information that you provide in connection with the Services will be used to provide the services you have requested or authorized . We create aggregate data about users of our Services for product development and improvement activities . We also use it for market analysis . We may provide information about users of our Services in aggregate form to third parties . For example , WebMD may tell a client what percentage of registered users of the WebMD Health Professional Network reside in a particular geographical area or specialize in a particular clinical area , or what percentage of participants in a market research survey selected a particular response to a survey question . When aggregated information is provided to a third party , it is pooled with many individual records and stripped of any data that could be used to identify an individual . Any third party that receives aggregated information must agree not to attempt to re-identify the people it belongs to . Depending on our agreement with the third party , we may or may not charge for this information . WebMD may target its advertising and marketing ( e.g. , through e-mail and on-site communications ) based on information that you provide when you register for the Services and information that it receives from third party sources . For example , a user that WebMD knows is a cardiologist may be served cardiology-related advertisements on both WebMD-owned and third party websites that a neurologist will not see , or a user that WebMD knows is a healthcare professional who treats diabetes may be served advertisements for new diabetes therapies that other users would not see ( although in neither case will the advertiser have access to any personally identifiable information about you ) . WebMD serves these ads through the use of cookies and web beacons , as described above . Additionally , WebMD may geographically target its advertising to registered and unregistered users based on IP address . WebMD may also personalize the Services and the advertising that registered users see on the WebMD Sites based on their interests . For example , you may see different articles and advertisements in different places on medscape.com based on information you have shared with WebMD such as your specialty , information that WebMD has obtained by observing your previous activity within the WebMD Professional Network , or information that WebMD has received from third party sources , as described in this Privacy Policy . In addition to aggregate information ( discussed previously ) , we each may each share some kinds of personally identifiable information with third parties as described below . Other Companies : We have strategic relationships with other companies who offer products and services through the Services . When you are interacting with one of these companies , a different privacy policy may apply and will be presented to you at such time . Companies and People Who Work for Us : We each contract with other companies and individuals to help us provide our respective services . For example , we may host some of our Professional Sites on another company 's computers , hire technical consultants to maintain any Web-based clinical tools , work with companies to remove repetitive information from customer lists , analyze data , provide marketing assistance ( including assisting us in targeting our advertisements as described herein ) , or provide customer service or fulfillment services . In addition , if you are a healthcare professional , we may request that a third party validate your licensure status and other information against available databases of healthcare professionals . In order to provide these services , these other companies may have limited access to some of the personally identifiable information we maintain about users of our Services . We require all such companies to comply with the terms of this Privacy Policy , to limit their access to any personal information to the minimum necessary to perform their obligations , and not to use the information they may access for purposes other than fulfilling their responsibilities to us . Market Research : From time to time , we may invite you to participate in sponsored or unsponsored market research surveys as further described above . We may provide aggregate information from the survey results to third parties including the survey sponsor , if applicable . If you receive remuneration for participating in a sponsored survey , we may be required to provide the sponsor with personally identifiable information about you for its recordkeeping and regulatory reporting purposes . We will not provide any sponsor with your survey responses on an identifiable basis unless we obtain your consent prior to your participation in the survey . If you participate in a survey administered by a third party market research company , this company may identify you when you participate in the survey . We require these companies to agree that they will not provide the survey sponsor with personally identifiable information about you based on your participation in the survey , nor will they market to you based on such participation . Sponsored Programs : When you use WebMD 's Services through a WebMD Site , newsletter , Medscape Mobile or other means , you may be presented with advertisements and opportunities to engage in industry-sponsored informational programs consisting of sponsor-selected materials ( " Sponsored Programs " ) . All advertisements and Sponsored Programs ( including any links to Sponsored Programs ) will be identified to you by the label Advertisement , Information from Industry , Sponsored , WebMD Professional or some similar designation indicating that the content has been selected by a third-party sponsor . Examples of Sponsored Programs include information resources featuring branded or unbranded commercial content , interactive programs that provide information about medical conditions , treatments and products , multi-media presentations including video featuring a key opinion leader and safety and regulatory information resources . We may make Sponsored Programs available to you through email or on-site media units , all of which will be identified as described above . When you choose to engage in a Sponsored Program , you may be asked to provide personally identifiable information ( e.g. , postal address , telephone number , e-mail address , etc. )  which may be used to supplement information about you that we have already received during member registration . In addition , we may collect information in connection with a transaction that you have requested ( e.g. , sample request , sales rep visit , etc. ) , responses to Sponsored Program questions , and/or gift requests and issuance . Even if you do not provide us with personally identifiable information , we collect non-personally identifiable information about your use of Sponsored Programs through cookies and web beacons , as described above . The personally identifiable information that you provide when you engage in a Sponsored Program will be used to provide the services you have requested or authorized , respond to your questions , provide you the specific services you select and to send you emails about new programs and selected information from our sponsors as it relates to your specialty or area of clinical practice . You may also receive invitations to engage in other Sponsored Programs from the same sponsor . When you are exposed to an advertisement through the Services , whether on a WebMD Site or Medscape Mobile , in a newsletter or through some other means , and when you engage in a Sponsored Program , e.g. , access a sponsored information resource or open a Sponsored Program e-mail from WebMD Professional , WebMD may identify you by name to the sponsor of the advertisement or Sponsored Program and/or its agents on the sponsor 's behalf , as well as to potential sponsors of advertisements and Sponsored Programs that may be provided to you through the Services . We may also provide such third parties with your specialty and country where you reside , based on your registration profile . We will not provide these third parties with your personal contact information such as email or postal address . We are not responsible for how these third parties use your information and manage your privacy . Further , we may use non-personally identifiable information for research purposes , and we may provide this information in the aggregate to third parties . For example , we might inform third parties regarding the number of users of a Sponsored Program and the activities they conduct while engaged in the Program . Business Transfers : If one of us transfers a business unit ( such as a subsidiary ) or an asset ( such as a website ) to another company , that company will be required to honor the applicable terms of this Privacy Policy . Legal Requirements : We may release account and other personally identifiable information when we believe release ( 1 ) is required to comply with valid legal requirements such as a law , regulation , search warrant , subpoena or court order ; or ( 2 ) is reasonable in response to a physical threat to you or others , to protect property or defend or assert legal rights . In the event that we are legally compelled to disclose your personally identifiable information to a third party , we will attempt to notify you unless doing so would violate the law , court order or government instruction . Consent : We may release personally identifiable information to a third party in accordance with your consent , subject to the purposes and limits that we disclose when we request your consent . For example , when you choose to participate in a Sponsored Program , we may provide certain personally identifiable information to the sponsor of such program and to potential sponsors of programs , as further described above . If we discover that a third party inadvertently disclosed personally identifiable information about any of our users , we will take immediate action to prevent further occurrences . In this section of our Privacy Policy , we discuss the security measures we take to protect information that we have collected about you . We have implemented technology and security policies , rules and other measures to protect the personal data that we have under our control from unauthorized access , improper use , alteration , unlawful or accidental destruction , and accidental loss . We also protect your information by requiring that all our employees and others who have access to or are associated with the processing of your data respect your confidentiality . We use security methods to determine the identity of registered users , so that appropriate rights and restrictions can be enforced for that user . Reliable verification of user identity is called authentication . We use both passwords and usernames to authenticate users . Users are responsible for maintaining their own passwords . Employees are required to keep your information private , as a condition of their employment with us . Only selected , authorized employees are permitted to access health information . All employees and contractors must abide by our Privacy Policy , and those who violate that policy are subject to disciplinary action , up to and including termination of their employment and legal action . In this section of this Privacy Policy , we tell you how to obtain and correct information we have about you , and how to choose what types of information you may share with us . Correction of Information We Have About You If you believe that there are errors in the registration information associated with your account , you may edit your personal profile any time that you like . You can directly edit your user profile on the Professional Site on which you initially registered . Requests for deletion of your record may result in your removal from the registry , but we may keep certain demographic information about you for product improvement purposes . You may contact Customer Support and ask for the changes that you would like to make . Use of your Information Outside of the EEA WebMD and Medscape are located in the United States .

It is optional for you to provide demographic information ( such as profession and number of children ) , but providing this information is encouraged so we can provide a more personalized experience on our Website . Cookies and Action Tags . We also collect Non-Personally Identifiable Information passively using " cookies " and " action tags.

Cookies may be used to : personalize your experience on our Website ( e.g. , to dynamically generate content on webpages specifically designed for you ) , assist you in using our Online Products ( e.g. , to save you time by not having to reenter your name upon each visit to our Website ) , and allow us to statistically monitor how you are using our Website for purposes of improving our online offerings .

The data is collected on an aggregate , anonymous basis , which means that no personally identifiable information is associated with the data . This data helps us improve our content and overall usage . The information is not shared with other organizations for their independent use . In order to ensure a good user experience , certain data may be temporarily or permanently cached by the Mobile Applications on users ' mobile devices .

Except as disclosed in this Privacy Statement , we do not collect any identifiable information about visitors to this site or the KP Mobile Applications . The policies , sources , and uses of information are outlined in Sections 1 through 13 that follow : 1 . Web logs We maintain standard Web logs that record data about all visitors and customers who use this site or the KP Mobile Applications and we store this information for a while . These logs may contain the Internet domain from which you access the site ( such as aol.com , abc.org , etc. ) ; the IP address which is automatically assigned to your computer when you get on the Internet ( a static IP address may be identifiable as being connected to you , while a dynamic address is usually not identifiable ) ; the type of browser and operating system you use ; the date and time you visited ; the pages or mobile screens you viewed ; and the address of the website you linked from , if any . If you sign on to this website or the KP Mobile Application to use secured features , our Web logs will also contain an individual identifier and show the services you have accessed . All Web logs are stored securely , and may only be accessed by Kaiser Permanente employees or designees on a need-to-know basis for a specific purpose . Kaiser Permanente uses Web log information to help us design our site and the KP Mobile Applications , to identify popular features , to resolve user , hardware , and software problems , and to make the site and the KP Mobile Applications more useful to visitors . 2 . Internet cookies We may place Internet " cookies " on the computer hard drives of visitors to this Kaiser Permanente website or the KP Mobile Applications . Information we obtain from cookies helps us to tailor our site and the KP Mobile Applications to be more helpful and efficient for our visitors . The cookie consists of a unique identifier that does not contain information about you or your health history . We use two types of cookies , " session " cookies and " persistent " cookies . A session cookie is temporary , and expires after you end a session and close your web browser or the KP Mobile Application browser . We use session cookies to help customize your experience on our site , maintain your signed-on status as you navigate through our features , and to track your " click path " through our Web pages or mobile screens . Persistent cookies remain on your hard drive after you 've exited from our website , and we use them for several reasons . For instance , when you give us permission to " remember " a feature about you when asked by the website , such as your Kaiser Permanente region , we place a persistent cookie on your hard drive so that the next time you visit us , we wo n't have to ask you that information again . If you 've given us permission to email you with information about your Kaiser Permanente benefits , or for other reasons , we may place a persistent cookie on your hard drive that will let us know when you come back to visit our site . We sometimes use this type of persistent cookie with a " Web beacon " ( see below ) . Persistent cookies will not contain any personal information about you such as a Kaiser Permanente Health/Medical Record number . You may have software on your computer that will allow you to decline or deactivate Internet cookies , but if you do so , some features of this site or the KP Mobile Applications may not work properly for you . For instructions on how to remove cookies from your hard drive , go to your browser 's website for detailed instructions . In addition , further information regarding cookies may be available on other websites or from your Internet service provider . Safari , Chrome , Firefox , Internet Explorer and iOS browsers are commonly used browsers . 3 . Web beacons We may also occasionally use " Web beacons " ( also known as " clear gifs , " " Web bugs , " " 1-pixel gifs , " etc. )  that allow us to collect non-personal information about your response to our email communications , and for other purposes . Web beacons are tiny images , placed on a Web page or email , that can tell us if you 've gone to a particular area on our website . For example , if you 've given us permission to send you emails , we may send you an email urging you to use a certain feature on our website . If you do respond to that email and use that feature , the Web beacon will tell us that our email communication with you has been successful . We do not collect any personal health information with a Web beacon , and do not link Web beacons with any other personal health information you 've given us . Since Web beacons are used in conjunction with persistent cookies ( described above ) , if you set your browser to decline or deactivate cookies , Web beacons can not function . 4 . Emails Kaiser Permanente uses a third-party vendor to help us manage some of our email communications with you . While we do supply this vendor with email addresses of those we wish them to contact , your email address is never used for any purpose other than to communicate with you on our behalf . When you click on a link in an email , you may temporarily be redirected through one of the vendor 's servers ( although this process will be invisible to you ) which will register that you 've clicked on that link , and have visited our website or KP Mobile Application . Kaiser Permanente never shares any information , other than your email address , with our third-party email vendor , which does not share these email addresses with anyone else .

Messages and transactions Comments or questions sent to us using email or secure messaging forms will be shared with Kaiser Permanente staff and health care professionals who are most able to address your concerns . We will archive your messages once we have made our best effort to provide you with a complete and satisfactory response .

Data about your transaction may be stored in these systems , and available to people who test and support these systems .

While you may use some of the functionality of WebMD without registration , many of the specific tools and services on the WebMD Web Sites require that you register with WebMD . Cookies and Web Beacons We collect Non-Personal Information about your use of the WebMD Web Sites and your use of other web sites through the use of Cookies and Web Beacons . " Cookies " are small data files that are stored on the hard drive of the computer you use to view a web site . Every computer that accesses the WebMD Web Sites is assigned a different cookie by WebMD . " Web Beacons " are graphic image files imbedded in a web page typically used to monitor activity on a web page and send back to its home server ( which can belong to the host site , a network advertiser or some other third party ) information from your browser , such as the IP address , the URL of the page on which the beacon is located , the type browser that is accessing the site and the ID number of any Cookies on your computer previously placed by that server . Third parties under contract with WebMD may use Cookies or Web Beacons to collect Non-Personal Information about your usage of the WebMD Web Sites , including which health topics you have viewed . These third party advertising service providers may use this information , on our behalf , to help WebMD deliver advertising on the WebMD Web Sites as well as on other sites on the Internet based on your browsing activity on our sites .

This number can not be used to identify you personally , and we can not identify you personally unless you choose to become a registered user of the App . We use this random number in a manner similar to our use of Cookies as described in this Privacy Policy . Unlike Cookies , the random number is assigned to your installation of the App itself and not a browser , because the App does not work through your browser . Therefore the random number can not be removed through settings . If you do not want us to use the random number for the purposes for which we use Cookies , please do not use the Mobile Device Apps . Also , due to technical limitations , our TRUSTed Ads program is not implemented on our Mobile Device Apps and if you are using an IOS device , on our mobile optimized sites . Because some of the content on our Mobile Device Apps direct your mobile device to our website you will be exposed to the cookies that we use and to third party cookies that may be contained in advertisements that we do not control and will be unable to delete any of these cookies with your mobile device . Therefore , if you do not want to use these cookies when you use your mobile device you should not use our Mobile Device Apps and you should set your mobile device to reject cookies when you use our mobile optimized sites .

Sponsors or advertisers on the WebMD Web Sites may use their own Cookies , Web Beacons or other online tracking technologies in the banner advertisements served on the WebMD Web Sites and in emails , special promotions or newsletters we send you . Their advertisements may be displayed on the WebMD Web Sites or on other sites that you visit after you visit the WebMD Web Sites . Some advertisers use companies other than WebMD to serve their ads and to monitor users ' responses to ads , and these companies ( " Ad Servers " ) may also collect Non-Personal Information through the use of Cookies or Web Beacons on the WebMD Web Sites . We do not control how third parties use Cookies or Web Beacons or how they manage the Non-Personal Information they gather through the use of these technologies on the WebMD Web Sites . However , we do require sponsors , advertisers and Ad Servers who collect cookie or web beacon information through the WebMD Web Sites to agree that they will not collect any Personal Information from the WebMD Web Sites without your consent . They have promised us they will not link any Non-Personal Information collected by them on the WebMD Web Sites to Personal Information they or others collect in other ways or from other sites except as may be described in connection with a particular program .
