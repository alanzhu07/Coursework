" Pixel tracking " , a common process which may be used in connection with advertisements on other sites , involves the use of pixel tags that are not visible to the user of the site and consist of a few lines of computer coding .

This allows us to speed up your future activities , saving the time you would normally spend entering information such as your password or registration . In addition , Blizzard may use cookies to retrieve user information for promotional , marketing , or security purposes . Blizzard and our third-party tracking service also employ a software technology called clear gifs ( a.k.a. Web Beacons/Web Bugs ) , that help us better manage content on our site by informing us what content is effective . Clear gifs are tiny graphics with a unique identifier , similar in function to cookies , and are used to track the online movements of Web users . In contrast to cookies , which are stored on a user 's computer hard drive , clear gifs are embedded invisibly on Web pages and are about the size of the period at the end of this sentence . These clear gifs are not tied to personally identifiable information . Our third-party tracking service uses cookies and clear gifs to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate . They capture usage and volume statistics to help improve our Web site . We have no access or control of these third-party tracking utilities . We also use clear gifs in our HTML-based emails to let us know which emails have been opened by recipients . This allows us to gauge the effectiveness of certain communications and the effectiveness of our marketing campaigns . For this reason , these types of clear gifs are tied to personally identifiable information . An Internet protocol ( " IP " ) address is the unique number assigned to your server or Internet Service Provider ( " ISP " ) . Blizzard may track such IP addresses for system administration , to report aggregate information , site tracking , security purposes , or to prevent our servers from being abused . If for any reason you are concerned with the way we are using your personal information , or would like to correct or request that we delete such personal information , please contact Blizzard Entertainment Privacy Policy , Attention : Privacy Policy Administrator , at 16215 Alton Pkwy . Irvine CA 92618-3616 . You can also contact us by e-mailing us at privacy @ blizzard.com . We will respond to any request for access within 30 days . In some cases , we may not be able to delete your personal information and will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations , resolve disputes , and enforce our agreements .

PLEASE READ THIS CAREFULLY . IT AFFECTS YOUR RIGHTS . Most customer concerns can be resolved quickly and to your satisfaction by logging into our customer support interface with your Origin Account at help.ea.com . In the unlikely event that EA can not resolve a concern to your satisfaction ( or if EA can not resolve a concern it has with you after attempting to do so informally ) , then you and EA agree to be bound by the following procedure to resolve any and all disputes between us . This provision applies to all consumers to the fullest extent allowable by law , but expressly excludes residents of Quebec , Russia , Switzerland , the Member States of the European Union , and the Republic of Korea . By accepting these terms , you and EA expressly waive the right to a trial by jury or to participate in a class action . This agreement is intended to be interpreted broadly . This Section covers any and all disputes between us ( " Disputes " ) , including without limitation :  - claims arising out of or relating to any aspect of the relationship between us , whether based in contract , tort , statute , fraud , misrepresentation or any other legal theory ; - claims that arose before this Agreement or any prior agreement ( including , but not limited to , claims relating to advertising ) ; - claims that are currently the subject of purported class action litigation in which you are not a member of a certified class ; and - claims that may arise after the termination of this Agreement . The only disputes that are not covered by this Section are the following :  - a claim to enforce or protect , or concerning the validity of , any of your or EA 's ( or any of EA 's licensors ' ) intellectual property rights ; - a claim related to , or arising from , allegations of theft , piracy , or unauthorized use ; - In addition , nothing in this Section shall prevent either party from initiating a small claims court action . References to " EA , " " you , " and " us " include our respective subsidiaries , affiliates , agents , employees , predecessors in interest , successors , and assigns , as well as all authorized or unauthorized users or beneficiaries of services or Software under this or prior Agreements between us . This arbitration provision evidences a transaction in interstate commerce , and thus the Federal Arbitration Act governs the interpretation and enforcement of this provision . This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service . A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute . You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration . Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ( " Notice of Dispute " ) . Notices of Dispute must : ( a ) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party ; ( b ) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and ( c ) set forth the specific relief sought ( " Demand " ) . EA will send its Notice of Dispute to your billing address ( if you provided it to us ) or to the email address you provided to us . You will send your Notice of Dispute to : Electronic Arts Inc. , 209 Redwood Shores Parkway , Redwood City CA 94065 , ATTENTION : Legal Department . B. Binding Arbitration . If you and EA are unable to resolve a Dispute through informal negotiations within 30 days after receipt of the Notice of Dispute , either you or EA may elect to have the Dispute finally and exclusively resolved by binding arbitration . Any election to arbitrate by one party shall be final and binding on the other . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT BY THIS PROVISION , YOU AND EA ARE FOREGOING THE RIGHT TO SUE IN COURT AND HAVE A JURY TRIAL . The arbitration shall be commenced and conducted under the Commercial Arbitration Rules of the American Arbitration Association ( AAA ) and , where appropriate , the AAA 's Supplementary Procedures for Consumer Related Disputes ( AAA Consumer Rules ) , both of which are available at the AAA website www.adr.org . Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and , where appropriate , limited by the AAA Consumer Rules . If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive , or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration , then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses . The arbitration may be conducted in person , through the submission of documents , by phone or online . The arbitrator will make a decision in writing , and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party . The arbitrator must follow applicable law , and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so . You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration , to stay proceeding pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . C. Restrictions . You and EA agree that any arbitration shall be limited to the Dispute between EA and you individually . To the full extent permitted by law , ( 1 ) no arbitration shall be joined with any other ; ( 2 ) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be arbitrated on a class action-basis or to utilize class action procedures ; and ( 3 ) there is no right or authority for any Dispute to be brought in a purported representative capacity on behalf of the general public or any other persons . YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY , AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING . Further , unless both you and EA agree otherwise , the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person 's claims , and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable , then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void . D. Location . If you are a resident of the United States , arbitration will take place at any reasonable location convenient for you . For residents outside the United States , arbitration shall be initiated in the County of San Mateo , State of California , United States of America , and you and EA agree to submit to the personal jurisdiction of that court , in order to compel arbitration , to stay proceedings pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . E. Recovery and Attorneys ' Fees . If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA 's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator , then EA will :  - Pay you 150 % of your arbitration award , up to $ 5,000 over and above your arbitration award ; and - Pay your attorney , if any , the amount of attorneys ' fees , and reimburse any expenses ( including expert witness fees and costs ) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating , preparing , and pursuing your claim in arbitration ( " the attorney premium " ) . The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees , expenses , and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . The right to attorneys ' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys ' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law , although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys ' fees or costs . EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us . F. Limitation on Arbitrator 's Authority . The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party 's individual claim . G. Changes to This Provision . Notwithstanding any provision in this Agreement to the contrary , we agree that if EA makes any future change to this arbitration provision ( other than a change to the Notice Address ) , you may reject any such change by sending us written notice within 30 days of the change to the Arbitration Notice Address provided above .

This arbitration provision shall survive termination of these Terms of Service . A. Informal Negotiations/Notice of Dispute . You and EA agree to first attempt to negotiate any Dispute informally for at least 30 days before initiating arbitration . Such informal negotiations commence upon receipt of written notice from one person to the other ( " Notice of Dispute " ) . Notices of Dispute must : ( a ) include the full name and contact information of the complaining party ; ( b ) describe the nature and basis of the claim or dispute ; and ( c ) set forth the specific relief sought ( " Demand " ) .

Your arbitration fees and your share of arbitrator compensation shall be governed by the AAA Rules and , where appropriate , limited by the AAA Consumer Rules . If such costs are determined by the arbitrator to be excessive , or if you send EA a notice to the Notice of Dispute address above indicating that you are unable to pay the fees required to initiate an arbitration , then EA will promptly pay all arbitration fees and expenses . The arbitration may be conducted in person , through the submission of documents , by phone or online . The arbitrator will make a decision in writing , and shall provide a statement of reasons if requested by either party . The arbitrator must follow applicable law , and any award may be challenged if the arbitrator fails to do so . You and EA may litigate in court to compel arbitration , to stay proceeding pending arbitration , or to confirm , modify , vacate or enter judgment on the award entered by the arbitrator . C.

YOU AND EA AGREE THAT EACH MAY BRING CLAIMS AGAINST THE OTHER ONLY IN YOUR OR ITS INDIVIDUAL CAPACITY , AND NOT AS A PLAINTIFF OR CLASS MEMBER IN ANY PURPORTED CLASS OR REPRESENTATIVE PROCEEDING . Further , unless both you and EA agree otherwise , the arbitrator may not consolidate more than one person 's claims , and may not otherwise preside over any form of a representative or class proceeding . If this specific provision is found to be unenforceable , then the entirety of this arbitration provision shall be null and void . D. Location .

E. Recovery and Attorneys ' Fees . If the arbitrator rules in your favor on the merits of any claim you bring against EA and issues you an award that is greater in monetary value than EA 's last written settlement offer made before written submissions are made to the arbitrator , then EA will :  - Pay you 150 % of your arbitration award , up to $ 5,000 over and above your arbitration award ; and - Pay your attorney , if any , the amount of attorneys ' fees , and reimburse any expenses ( including expert witness fees and costs ) that you or your attorney reasonably accrues for investigating , preparing , and pursuing your claim in arbitration ( " the attorney premium " ) . The arbitrator may make rulings and resolve disputes as to the payment and reimbursement of fees , expenses , and the alternative payment and the attorney premium at any time during the proceeding and upon request from either party made within 14 days of the arbitrator 's ruling on the merits . The right to attorneys ' fees and expenses discussed above supplements any right to attorneys ' fees and expenses you may have under applicable law , although you may not recover duplicative awards of attorneys ' fees or costs . EA waives any right it may have to seek an award of attorneys ' fees and expenses in connection with any arbitration between us . F. Limitation on Arbitrator 's Authority . The arbitrator may award declaratory or injunctive relief only in favor of the individual party seeking relief and only to the extent necessary to provide relief warranted by that party 's individual claim .

We are especially careful in any communications with children under the age of 13 ( " Child " or " Children " ) . Ubisoft restricts access to certain Services on age grounds and , in certain jurisdictions , for certain Services and functions , asks for parent approval when a Child wishes to register for the Services . When we intend to collect personal information from a Child , we take additional steps to protect children 's privacy , including : Notifying parents about our information practices with regard to Children , including the types of personal information we may collect from Children , the uses to which we may put that information , and whether and with whom we may share that information In accordance with applicable law , obtaining consent from parents for the collection of personal information from their Children , or for sending information about our products and services directly to their Children Limiting our collection of personal information from Children to no more than is reasonably necessary to participate in an online activity Giving parents access or the ability to request access to personal information we have collected from their Children and the ability to request that the personal information be changed or deleted More specifically , when a Child under the age of 13 registers , ( s ) he must supply the e-mail address of a parent or legal guardian who will be contacted by Ubisoft to ask him/her to confirm , refuse to modify his/her Minor 's registration . Ubisoft reserves the right to limit the period during which a child under the age of 13 may play pending confirmation and activation by his/her parent or guardian . Ubisoft reserves the right to ask for written proof of parental consent for any user or potential user of the services suspected to be a Child . Parental consent applies exclusively to the specific service for which it has been granted . Certain Services are specifically designed for Children and enable Children under the age of 13 to create their own free accounts for which Ubisoft collects their username , password , date of birth ( or age ) , country , and parent or guardian 's e-mail address . Such services sometimes offer the possibility of paying for a subscription or certain game functions which enable Children to participate in more activies on the Services by making a payment . The subscription services may also allow parents or guardians to manage their Child 's account and create their own player accounts . Certain services enable Children to create personalized avatars which they can use in numerous activies in the services , including mini-games and virtual worlds . Children may also use other functions of the Services such as " Recommend to a friend " to invite a friend to find out about the servies . The " Recommend to a friend " functions enable Children to send their friends a single message inviting them to visit the related service . Ubisoft will collect the first name and e-mail address of your Child ( or , failing that , the e-mail address of the parent or guardian ) and the e-mail address of his/her friend for the sole purpose of sending a single message . This information is neither stored nor used for any other purpose and we do not reveal your child 's e-mail address to the recipient . Parents may delete their Child 's Account or change their Child 's privacy settings at any time by creating a parental Account or by sending an e-mail to the administrator of the Privacy Policy , who is identified below . In all cases , use of the Services by Children must take place under the responsibility of their parents or legal guardians and any use of the Services is assumed to have been validated by them . AS FAR AS IS PERMITTED BY APPLICABLE LEGISLATION , UBISOFT DECLINES ANY RESPONSIBILITY REGARDING ANY ACTIVITIES WHICH MAY BE CONDUCTED BY CHILDREN WITHOUT THE PERMISSION OF THEIR PARENTS OR LEGAL GUARDIANS . IF YOU ARE A PARENT OR LEGAL GUARDIAN AND YOU GIVE YOUR PERMISSION FOR YOUR CHILD TO REGISTER FOR ONE OR OTHER OF THE SERVICES , YOU THEREBY AGREE TO THE TERMS RELATING TO USE OF THE SERVICES BY YOUR CHILD . A6 . The services may contain links to other websites . For instance , purchases of Virtual Currency or Virtual Items for Ubisoft Services may be transacted on a third party processors site . Any personal information you provide on linked pages or applications is provided directly to that third party and is subject to that third party 's privacy policy . This Privacy Policy does not apply to such linked sites , and we are not responsible for the content or privacy and security practices and policies of these websites or any other sites that are linked to or from the Services . We encourage you to learn about their privacy and security practices and policies before providing them with personal information . A7 .

Please send your revocation to the email address indicated below . No other costs shall be incurred for a revocation apart from the costs of transmitting such revocation . f ) Payment processing You will have to supply additional information when making a payment and the type of data depends on the kind of payment method you have selected . TRAVIAN GAMES offers a range of anonymous payment methods . TRAVIAN GAMES will forward the data required to process the payment to the service providers responsible for collecting the payment . TRAVIAN GAMES will assign TG Payment GmbH in Munich ( Germany ) to provide such payment services . Collaboration with third parties also involves payment processing via external service providers ( PayPal , credit card companies , mobile network operators , etc. ) . These third parties are legally bound to manage your personal data in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with prevailing legislation and may only use your personal data to fulfill their contractual obligations . When you initiate a payment during the game , a cookie will be set that contains a randomly generated ID number . This cookie will be required to return you to the game once the payment process has been completed . TRAVIAN GAMES employs persons responsible for ensuring the correct implementation of the payment processing is adhered to and who can therefore access any information required to do so . Such employees act exclusively in accordance with the stipulations and instructions of TRAVIAN GAMES and are tasked in particular with ensuring compliance with prevailing data protection regulations . Such employees use anonymized payment data to detect and prevent any misuse of the payment processes . In the event of a violation , the payment process will be canceled . In addition , TRAVIAN GAMES reserves the right to use the available data to implement further measures and to potentially merge it with other personal data . TRAVIAN GAMES is entitled to provide data to third parties to whom receivables due to TRAVIAN GAMES from the user have been assigned or to third parties who are responsible for collecting payment to the extent required to fulfill the collection of the receivables or the collection of the charges . In certain cases TRAVIAN GAMES will forward your personal data to the following third parties : Payment providers ( see above ) IT service providers ( e.g. email providers , host providers ) Database services ( e.g. analysis of advertising campaigns ) Associated companies ( e.g. payment data to TG Payment GmbH ) State agencies ( e.g. investigating authorities ) Such third parties are legally bound to manage your personal data in a confidential and secure manner in accordance with prevailing legislation and can only access your personal data if such data is required to fulfill their contract , respectively there is a legal basis for such access .

The above sections describe in more detail how TRAVIAN GAMES uses web beacons . c ) Social plug-ins TRAVIAN GAMES uses social plug-ins on its websites and games such as Facebook 's Like button or Facebook Connect and Google 's Google +1 button . A shared feature of social plug-ins is that when you access a TRAVIAN GAMES website that uses a social plug-in , the same data will be forwarded to the social plug-in provider that would be forwarded if you accessed the provider 's website directly . So for example when you call up a provider website that has Facebook 's Like button embedded , Facebook will receive your IP address , the browser version and screen resolution and the operating system of the device you have used to access the site and the URL of the website containing the Like button . This applies even if you have used none of the services offered by such providers . If the plug-in has been provided by Facebook or Google , the abovementioned data will be transferred to the USA .

Depending on the Promotion , we may also collect an Internet email address or other Information and , depending on the Information collected , the user may also be required to confirm his or her agreement to this Privacy Policy and the Terms of Use Agreement . We caution that most wireless transmissions are not secured and there is a greater risk of an unknown third party 's interception of messages or a user 's Personal Information when using a wireless communications device . Users that register for GameTrailers ' wireless marketing services acknowledge , understand and agree that they will be charged by the user 's wireless carrier for all messages sent to the user from GameTrailers . Standard messaging rates will apply , unless noted otherwise . Under no circumstances will the Site , GameTrailers , its Parent Companies or Affiliates be responsible for any wireless email or text messaging charges incurred by a user or by a person that has access to a user 's wireless device , telephone number , or email address . a . Registration . To the extent we provide wireless marketing services , there are two registration methods provided for GameTrailers ' wireless marketing services . Standard rate Promotions will be subject to either the " single opt-in " or the " double-opt-in " ( Site/SMS ) method , at the discretion of GameTrailers depending on the type of Promotion . Premium rate services will require the " double opt-in " ( Site/SMS or SMS/SMS ) method . i . Single Opt-in Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted . The user 's voluntary submission of the designated word or code to GameTrailers will mean that the user has freely and affirmatively granted permission to GameTrailers to send text messages to him or her . GameTrailers will thank the user for his or her registration by sending a " Thank you " message . The user may terminate the service at any time by using the unsubscribe command in any text message from GameTrailers or by sending a text message to GameTrailers that says " STOP " , " END " , " CANCEL " , " REMOVE " , " UNSUBSCRIBE " or " QUIT " . ii . Double Opt-in ( Site/SMS ) Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to this Site to start the registration process . The user must affirmatively consent to GameTrailers ' sending of wireless messages to his or her designated wireless device by submitting a telephone number ( or wireless email address , only if requested by GameTrailers ) and by clicking the consent statement on the Site 's registration page . The user must also agree to the Site 's Privacy Policy and Terms of Use Agreement before the online registration process is completed . GameTrailers will then send a " Confirmation " message to the user 's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number ( or wireless domain name when appropriate ) . The user must respond to the " Confirmation " message with a text message that states " YES " or " Y " that will indicate the user 's acceptance of GameTrailers ' wireless marketing service . Until the user responds to the " Confirmation " message , the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion . A user may respond to the " Confirmation " message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user 's response to the " Confirmation " is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service . iii . Double Opt-in ( SMS/SMS ) Method : In response to print , radio , television , Internet , or other promotional messages , users will be directed to send a specific word or code via a text message to a designated telephone number to register for the service promoted . GameTrailers will then send a " Confirmation " message to the user 's designated wireless device and will request that the user confirm that he or she has agreed to receive messages from GameTrailers to that particular telephone number ( or wireless domain name when appropriate ) . The user must respond to the " Confirmation " message with a text message that states " YES " or " Y " that will indicate the user 's acceptance of GameTrailers ' wireless marketing service . Until the user responds to the " Confirmation " message , the user is not registered for the specific wireless marketing service subject to the Promotion . A user may respond to the " Confirmation " message at any time provided that GameTrailers may choose to terminate offering wireless marketing service at any time and the user 's response to the " Confirmation " is only valid if the response is received while GameTrailers continues to offer the specific wireless marketing service . b . Termination of Wireless Services by User . Regardless of which one of the above opt-in methods was used to register , users may revoke their consent to receive messages from GameTrailers by the following procedure :  A user may cancel one or more services via his or her wireless device at any time by using the unsubscribe mechanism provided by GameTrailers at the time the message is sent , or by sending a text message that says " STOP " , " END " , " CANCEL " , " REMOVE " , " UNSUBSCRIBE " or " QUIT " . GameTrailers will terminate the user 's registration for the most recent wireless service sent to the user . Any of these words followed by the word " ALL " in the user 's termination request will cancel all of the user 's registered wireless services with GameTrailers . If the user unsubscribes from one or all of GameTrailers service ( s ) via his or her wireless device , the service ( s ) will be terminated immediately and will cancel the user 's previous opt-in . c . Termination of Wireless Services by GameTrailers . A user understands , acknowledges and agrees that GameTrailers may , in its sole discretion and without liability to any user , terminate its offer of any specific wireless marketing service or all wireless marketing services at any time without advance notice . GameTrailers may provide notice of terminations or changes in services on this Site . d . Use of Information .
