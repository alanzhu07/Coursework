RED	THANK YOU . THIS IS QUITE AN INSTITUTION . IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HERE WITH YOU . IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK IN MICHIGAN . YOU KNOW , SOMEHOW EVERYTHING JUST SEEMS RIGHT HERE . IN THE WINTER , OF COURSE , THE SKIES ARE CLOUDY ALL DAY . MOST OF THE CARS YOU SEE ON THE ROADS ARE MADE HERE IN THE GOOD OLD U-S-OF A . PEOPLE KNOW THAT POP IS NOT A RELATIVE , IT'S A SOFT DRINK , AND THEY KNOW THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS THE BEST GINGER UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WORLD . AND OF COURSE , FOR ME , I HAVE A LOT OF MEMORIES HERE . THIS IS WHERE BOTH ANN AND I WERE BORN . IT'S WHERE I MET HER . WE WERE IN OUR SENIOR YEAR WHEN WE WENT TO A PARTY TOGETHER . I WAS IN SENIOR YEAR , SHE WAS A SOPHOMORE . SHE CAME WITH SOMEONE ELSE . I NOTICED HER AT AGE 16 . SHE WAS VERY INTERESTING . I WENT TO THE GUY WHO BROUGHT HER THERE AND SAID , 'LOOK , I LIVE CLOSER TO ANN THAN YOU DO , CAN I GIVE HER A RIDE HOME ?' WE'VE BEEN GOING STEADY EVER SINCE . SO WE KNOW EACH OTHER REAL WELL . I SAID TO HER AFTER WE MADE THE DECISION TO GET INTO THIS RACE , AND YOU'VE PROBABLY HEARD IT BEFORE , I SAID , 'ANN , IN YOUR WILDEST DREAMS DID YOU SEE ME RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ?' AND SHE SAID , 'MITT , YOU WEREN'T IN MY WILDEST DREAMS .' SHE'D BE HERE TODAY , BUT SHE'S IN LANSING , BY THE WAY , SPEAKING AT ANOTHER EVENT FOR ME . FIRST , ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE BEST ABOUT COMING BACK TO MICHIGAN IS THE MEMORIES I HAVE IN MY HEART OF MY MOM AND DAD . ONE OF MY FAVORITE STORIES , AND YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THIS BECAUSE THEY TOLD IT MORE THAN ONCE , WAS ABOUT MY DAD'S VISIT TO MT . PLEASANT , MICHIGAN , ON THE 4TH OF JULY . HE GOT UP AND SPOKE BEFORE THE TOWN . HE SAID , 'IT SURE IS GREAT BEING HERE IN MT . CLEMENT .' THERE WAS THIS BIG UNKNOWNWORD IN THE AUDIENCE AND MY MOTHER UNKNOWNWORD FORWARD AND SAID , 'GEORGE , IT'S PLEASANT , PLEASANT !' HE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD , IT SURE IS PLEASANT HERE IN MT . CLEMENT .' NOW I HAVE TO TELL YOU , IF I'M ELECTED AS PRESIDENT OF THIS GREAT LAND , I WILL NOT NEED A COMPASS TO TELL ME WHERE MICHIGAN IS . AND I WON'T NEED TO BE BRIEFED ON WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY OR WHAT'S HAPPENING TO MICHIGAN'S ECONOMY . YOU SEE , I'VE GOT MICHIGAN IN MY DNA . I'VE GOT IT IN MY HEART AND I'VE GOT CARS IN MY BLOODSTREAM . WHEN I WAS LIVING HERE , MICHIGAN WAS THE PRIDE OF THE COUNTRY AND REALLY THE ENVY OF THE ENTIRE WORLD . DETROIT WAS THE MOTOR CITY TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD . OF COURSE , THE HUDSON'S UNKNOWNWORD DAY PARADE WAS ONE OF THE GRAND TRADITIONS MY FAMILY ENJOYED . AND PERHAPS THE BIGGEST DAY OF THE YEAR FOR ME WAS BEING ABLE TO GO TO THE DETROIT AUTO SHOW . THIS WAS REALLY SOMETHING . MY DAD WAS HEAD OF A CAR COMPANY , YOU KNOW , HE MADE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE WERE ESCORTED FROM THE HOTEL WITH A POLICE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AWFULLY COOL , EVEN THOUGH WE HAD TO GO IN A RAMBLER . SO EXCITING . BUT A LOT HAS CHANGED SINCE THEN , AS YOU KNOW , AND NOT ALL OF IT IS GOOD . MICHIGAN IS ENDURING A ONE-STATE RECESSION , AND THE PROBLEM HAS ONLY BEEN EXACERBATED BY POOR CHOICES MADE BY SOME OF THE LEADERS IN LANSING TO RAISE TAXES AND TAKE THAT COURSE INSTEAD OF CUTTING SPENDING . UNEMPLOYMENT , NOW YOU KNOW THESE NUMBERS , UNEMPLOYMENT AT 7.4 % IS IN THE BASEMENT OF THE ENTIRE COUNTRY . A STATE AGENCY JUST THIS WEEK FORECAST THAT NEXT YEAR IT'S GOING TO GO TO 8.2 % AND AFTER THAT 8.7 % THE YEAR AFTER . AND THE QUESTION IS , WHAT HAS WASHINGTON DONE WITH THIS LOOMING , NOT LOOMING , THIS EXISTING CRISIS , THIS RECESSION , WHAT HAS WASHINGTON DONE TO HELP ? THE ANSWER IS NOT VERY MUCH AT ALL . IN FACT , IN FACE OF ALL OF THE EXISTING BURDENS THAT UNKNOWNWORD DOWN OUR DOMESTIC AUTO INDUSTRY , INSTEAD OF THROWING OVER A LIFE PRESERVER , WASHINGTON HAS DROPPED YET ANOTHER ANVIL ON MICHIGAN WITH HIGHER CAFE STANDARDS . AND NOW , IT'S PASSIVELY SITTING BACK TO SEE IF THE CAR COMPANIES CAN SWIM . AND THE ANSWER IS : JUST BARELY . A LOT OF WASHINGTON POLITICIANS ARE AWARE OF THE PAIN , BUT THEY HAVEN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT . AND OF COURSE , I HEAR PEOPLE FROM TIME TO TIME SAY , 'WELL , THAT'S MICHIGAN'S PROBLEM .' OR , THEY SAY SOMETHING LIKE , 'WELL , IT'S THE CAR COMPANIES . THEY JUST BROUGHT IT ON THEMSELVES .' BUT THAT'S WHERE THEY'RE WRONG . WHAT MICHIGAN IS FEELING WILL BE FELT BY THE ENTIRE NATION UNLESS WE WIN THE ECONOMIC BATTLE HERE . MICHIGAN IS A BIT LIKE THE CANARY IN THE MINE UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT'S HURTING MICHIGAN , IF IT'S LEFT UNCHECKED , WILL ULTIMATELY IMPERIL THE ENTIRE NATION . WHAT'S AT STAKE HERE , IN FACT , IS EVEN LARGER THAN THAT . IT'S EVEN LARGER THAN AN INDUSTRY AND A STATE . THE WORLD IS SEEING THE BEGINNING OF A GLOBAL COMPETITIVE STRUGGLE . IT PITS AT LEAST FOUR MAJOR ECONOMIC STRATEGIES AGAINST EACH OTHER , AND EACH OF THEM HAS FAR REACHING CONSEQUENCES FOR THE PEACE OF THE PLANET , THE PROSPERITY , AND SECURITY OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD . OUR STRATEGY . THE AMERICAN STRATEGY . YOU KNOW WELL . IT IS ECONOMIC FREEDOM COMBINED WITH PERSONAL FREEDOM . THAT'S OUR STRATEGY . CHINA'S STRATEGY IS COMMUNISM COMBINED WITH AN UNBRIDLED MORPHING OF FREE ENTERPRISE . CHINA DOESN'T FLINCH AT BUYING OIL FROM THE GENOCIDAL SUDANESE GOVERNMENT OR SELLING NUCLEAR TECHNOLOGY TO THE IRANIANS WHO THREATEN GENOCIDE . TODAY , CHINA ALONE ACCOUNTS FOR ONE-THIRD OF OUR TRADE IMBALANCE AS A NATION . THERE'S A THIRD STRATEGY ; IT'S BASED ON THE CONTROL OF ENERGY AND OIL . IT'S PURSUED BY A UNKNOWNWORD RUSSIA , BY HUGO CHAVEZ IN UNKNOWNWORD , BY IRAN'S PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD . TODAY , AS YOU KNOW , OUR ENERGY PURCHASES ACCOUNT FOR ANOTHER ONE-THIRD OF OUR TRADE IMBALANCE . THE FOURTH STRATEGY THAT'S BEING PURSUED IS RADICAL , VIOLENT JIHADISM . IT IS A VERY DIFFERENT CAMPAIGN . IT WANTS TO RETURN THE WORLD TO THE ECONOMY AND THE HUMAN CONDITION OF THE DARK AGES . VIOLENT JIHADISM HAS COST AMERICA THIS YEAR MORE IN OUR TREASURE THAN EVEN OUR PURCHASES OF OIL . AND , OF COURSE , MUCH MORE , IT HAS COST THE LIVES OF OUR COUNTRYMEN , AND OTHER PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD . WE'RE ACCUSTOMED AS A PEOPLE TO MEASURING OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IN TERMS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND AIRCRAFT AND DEFENSE SPENDING . BUT I WOULD SUGGEST THAT AS WE LOOK DOWN THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR THIS NEXT CENTURY , A BETTER MEASURE OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY IS THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY . YOU CANNOT HAVE A FIRST-TIER MILITARY AND HAVE A SECOND-TIER ECONOMY . THE SOVIET UNION LEARNED THAT THE HARD WAY AND RONALD REAGAN TAUGHT IT TO THEM . MICHIGAN'S ECONOMIC WORRIES SHOULD BE AMERICA'S WORRIES . I DON'T KNOW ABOUT THE WASHINGTON POLITICIANS , BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS : IF I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL NOT REST UNTIL MICHIGAN HAS COME BACK ! I AM CONVINCED THAT MICHIGAN CAN ONCE AGAIN LEAD THE WORLD'S AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY . BUT IT MEANS WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO CHANGE THINGS IN WASHINGTON . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO GO FROM POLITICIANS WHO SAY THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD ' OF MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS TO HAVE A PRESIDENT INSTEAD WHO WILL ACTUALLY TAKE ACTION TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT THEM . LET ME TELL YOU SOME OF THE PLACES WHERE I'D START . FIRST OF ALL , WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE HAVE AND TACKLE THEM HEAD ON . IF I'M PRESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY , I WILL ROLL UP MY SLEEVES IN THE FIRST 100 DAYS I'M IN OFFICE , AND I WILL PERSONALLY BRING TOGETHER INDUSTRY , LABOR , CONGRESSIONAL AND STATE LEADERS AND TOGETHER WE WILL DEVELOP A PLAN TO REBUILD AMERICA'S AUTOMOTIVE LEADERSHIP . IT WILL BE A PLAN THAT WORKS FOR MICHIGAN AND THAT WORKS FOR THE AMERICAN TAXPAYER . AND AS PART OF THIS , WE WILL DIRECTLY ADDRESS AND RECTIFY THE ENORMOUS PRODUCT COST AND CAPITAL COST DISADVANTAGES THAT CURRENTLY BURDEN THE DOMESTIC AUTOMAKERS . FROM LEGACY COSTS , TO HEALTH CARE COSTS , TO INCREASED CAFE STANDARD COSTS , TO THE COST OF EMBEDDED TAXES , DETROIT CAN ONLY THRIVE IF WASHINGTON IS AN ENGAGED PARTNER , NOT A DISINTERESTED OBSERVER . THE PLAN IS GOING TO HAVE TO INCLUDE INCREASES IN FUNDING FOR AUTOMOTIVE RELATED RESEARCH AS WELL AS NEW TAX BENEFITS INCLUDING MAKING THE RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TAX CREDIT PERMANENT . I AM NOT OPEN TO A BAIL OUT , BUT I AM OPEN TO A WORK OUT . WASHINGTON SHOULD NOT BE A BENEFACTOR , BUT IT CAN AND MUST BE A PARTNER . BUT THAT'S ONLY ONE STEP . WASHINGTON ALSO HAS TO STOP LOADING DETROIT DOWN WITH UNFUNDED MANDATES . OF COURSE , WE ALL WANT FUEL MILEAGE TO RISE , BUT DISCONTINUOUS CAFE LEAPS , UNCOORDINATED WITH THE DOMESTIC MANUFACTURERS , AND UNKNOWNWORD CONSIDERATION OF COMPETITIVENESS , KILLS JOBS AND IMPERILS THE ENTIRE INDUSTRY . WASHINGTON DICTATED CAFE IS NOT THE RIGHT ANSWER . WE ALSO HAVE TO STOP WASHINGTON POLITICIANS FROM IMPOSING ENORMOUS UNILATERAL ENERGY COSTS ON AMERICAN MANUFACTURING , INCLUDING AUTOMOTIVE MANUFACTURING . FOR EXAMPLE , THE MCCAIN-LIEBERMAN BILL UNKNOWNWORD IN CONGRESS UNILATERALLY IMPOSES NEW HIGH ENERGY COSTS ON U.S . MANUFACTURERS , WITH NO SAFETY VALVE . THE ENERGY INFORMATION AGENCY ESTIMATED THAT THIS BILL WOULD RAISE ELECTRIC RATES BY AS MUCH AS 25 % AND GASOLINE BY AS MUCH AS 68 CENTS A UNKNOWNWORD . AND THEIR ESTIMATE OF THE COST IN U.S . JOBS - 300,000 JOBS . SO IT'S NOT JUST A JOB KILLER , IT WOULD ALSO MAKE IT HARDER FOR FAMILIES TO MAKE THEIR ENDS MEET . NOW OF COURSE WE HAVE TO TACKLE THE THREAT OF CLIMATE CHANGE . BUT WE DON'T CALL IT AMERICA WARMING , WE CALL IT GLOBAL WARMING . PLACING CAPS AND TAXES ON THE U.S . ALONE JUST DRIVES MANUFACTURERS TO CHINA AND INDIA , AND DOES LITTLE MORE THAN MAKE WASHINGTON POLITICIANS FEEL WELCOME AT THE EMBASSY COCKTAIL PARTIES . NEXT , AND YOU'VE HEARD THIS BEFORE , THERE IS MORE HEALTHCARE COST IN AN AUTOMOBILE THAN STEEL COSTS . WE GOT HEALTHCARE INSURANCE PREMIUMS DOWN IN MY STATE AND WE GOT EVERYONE ON TRACK TO BE INSURED . WE WILL WORK TO DO THE SAME HERE AND FOR THE REST OF THE NATION . AND THEN A FINAL BURDEN , IT'S TIME TO FIX THE TAX CODE . CORPORATIONS , LIKE INDIVIDUALS , NEED LOWER AND SIMPLER TAXES . EMBEDDED TAXES PUT OUR PRODUCTS AT A DISADVANTAGE IN OUR HOME MARKET AND WHEREVER THEY COMPETE AROUND THE WORLD . WHEN WE SEND FOR EXAMPLE , A FORD MUSTANG OVERSEAS , IT'S NOT JUST LOADED WITH UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S LOADED WITH OUR EXCESSIVE HEALTHCARE COSTS , OUR EXCESSIVE REGULATORY BURDENS , OUR EXCESSIVE LEGAL LIABILITY BURDEN , AND THE TAXES PAID BY EVERY SINGLE AUTOMOTIVE UNKNOWNWORD TO HELP PUT PRODUCT INTO THAT CAR . YOU TAKE OFF THOSE BURDENS AND LET'S SHOW THEM HOW FAST A MUSTANG WILL ACTUALLY GO . OF COURSE , TAKING OFF THOSE BURDENS IS ONLY PART OF THE SOLUTION . IF WE'RE GOING TO BE THE WORLD'S GREATEST ECONOMIC POWER , WE ALSO HAVE TO INVEST IN THE FUTURE . IT'S TIME FOR US TO BE BOLD . I WILL MAKE A UNKNOWNWORD INCREASE . FROM UNKNOWNWORD BILLION TO $20 BILLION . IN OUR NATIONAL INVESTMENT IN ENERGY RESEARCH , FUEL TECHNOLOGY , MATERIALS SCIENCE , AND AUTOMOTIVE TECHNOLOGY . LET'S INVEST IN OUR FUTURE . AS YOU KNOW , RESEARCH SPINS OUT NEW IDEAS FOR NEW PRODUCTS , FROM BOTH SMALL BUSINESSES AND LARGE BUSINESSES . THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT'S HAPPENED IN HEALTHCARE . WE SPEND WHAT $30 BILLION A YEAR IN NIH , AND WE LEAD THE WORLD IN HEALTHCARE PRODUCTS . IN DEFENSE , WE SPEND EVEN MORE . WE LEAD THE WORLD IN DEFENSE PRODUCTS . WE ALSO SPEND MONEY IN THE SPACE INDUSTRY . AND WE LEAD THE WORLD IN PRODUCTS COMING OUT OF SPACE . LOOK HOW INDUSTRIES IN THESE OTHER STATES THAT HAVE THOSE ADVANTAGES THAT THRIVE FROM THE SPIN OF OTHER TECHNOLOGIES , FROM OUR INVESTMENT THERE . SO IF WE CAN INVEST IN HEALTHCARE , AND DEFENSE , AND SPACE , WHY NOT ALSO INVEST IN ENERGY AND FUEL TECHNOLOGY RIGHT HERE IN MICHIGAN ? MICHIGAN CAN BE A LABORATORY , JUST LIKE OTHER STATES . A DRAWING BOARD , FROM WHICH WE CAN INVENT THE FUTURE . SECOND , WE'LL TURN GOVERNMENT WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE MANAGED BY BUREAUCRATS , INTO PERSONAL ACCOUNTS THAT CAN BE MANAGED BY THE WORKERS THEMSELVES SO THEY CAN GAIN EDUCATION AT COMMUNITY COLLEGE OR THEY CAN PAY FOR ON-THE-JOB TRAINING IN REAL JOBS . THERE ARE CURRENTLY SOME 40 DIFFERENT WORKFORCE TRAINING PROGRAMS IN GOVERNMENT SPREAD OUT ALL OVER THE ENTIRE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . NOW LET'S REPLACE THE BUREAUCRACY AND THE BUREAUCRATS WITH PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND INDIVIDUAL OWNERSHIP . LONG TERM , WE'RE ONLY GOING TO LEAD THE WORLD ONLY IF OUR STUDENTS COMING IN NOW ARE THE BEST-EDUCATED IN THE WORLD . AND YOU KNOW THIS , ALMOST EVERY INDEPENDENT GROUP THAT'S LOOKED AT OUR PUBLIC SCHOOLS HAS SAID THAT WE'RE FALLING BEHIND INTERNATIONAL STANDARDS . AND THEIR NUMBER ONE PRESCRIPTION TIME AND AGAIN . TREAT TEACHERS LIKE THE REAL PROFESSIONALS THEY ARE . BETTER TEACHERS SHOULD BE BETTER PAID . TEACHERS SHOULD ALSO BE EVALUATED AND UNKNOWNWORD . AND , HERE'S A UNKNOWNWORD IDEA , EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN SHOULD COME AHEAD OF THE INTERESTS OF THE TEACHER'S UNION . AND FINALLY , WE HAVE TO SHAPE AMERICA'S TRADE POLICY TO OPEN MARKETS FOR OUR GOODS AND LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD ACROSS THE WORLD . FOR AMERICA TO REMAIN THE WORLD'S SUPERPOWER , WE HAVE TO REMAIN THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC SUPERPOWER . AND THAT REQUIRES US TO SUCCESSFULLY COMPETE EVERYWHERE IN THE WORLD . HOWEVER , AS WE PURSUE NEW TRADE AGREEMENTS , I'M FAR LESS INTERESTED IN JUST GETTING AN AGREEMENT SIGNED THAN I AM IN GETTING AN AGREEMENT SIGNED THAT IS GOOD FOR AMERICA . I PROMISE YOU THAT ANY NATION THAT UNKNOWNWORD MANIPULATES ITS CURRENCY , STEALS OUR PATENTS AND UNKNOWNWORD , DUMPS UNSAFE PRODUCTS IN OUR MARKETS , OR UNKNOWNWORD THE AMERICAN GOODS IN THEIR MARKET PLACE , WILL FACE A VERY AGGRESSIVE PRESIDENT ACROSS THE NEGOTIATING TABLE . NOW LET ME BE CLEAR , I STRONGLY SUPPORT FREE TRADE , BUT FREE TRADE HAS TO BE FAIR IN BOTH UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN THE PLAYING FIELD IS LEVEL , AMERICA CAN COMPETE WITH ANY COUNTRY IN THE WORLD . AND WE WILL WIN . I CAME HERE ABOUT A YEAR AGO AND TALKED ABOUT A NUMBER OF ACTIONS WHICH I THOUGHT WERE NECESSARY TO KEEP OUR NATIONAL ECONOMY STRONG . I TALKED ABOUT CUTTING SPENDING IN WASHINGTON , ABOUT ACROSS THE BOARD TAX CUTS , ABOUT NATIONAL TORT REFORM LIABILITY , AND I ALSO TALKED ABOUT ENTITLEMENT REFORM . BUT THESE AREN'T ENOUGH . WHAT WE FACE HERE IN MICHIGAN AND WHAT WE FACE AROUND THE COUNTRY IF WE DON'T TAKE ACTION HERE IN MICHIGAN , IS A FAR MORE COMPLEX SET OF PROBLEMS THAN MOST POLITICIANS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE . THERE IS NO ONE SILVER UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN IT COMES TO GETTING MICHIGAN BACK ON TRACK AND BUILDING A STRONG AMERICA , WE HAVE TO ADDRESS EVERY SINGLE PROBLEM I'VE SPOKEN ABOUT . AND I WILL . AND BY THE WAY , THAT'S WHAT I HAVE DONE ALL MY LIFE . I'VE TAKEN ON COMPLEX SITUATIONS , LED TOUGH NEGOTIATIONS , FOUND SOLUTIONS , AND THEN GOTTEN THINGS BACK ON TRACK . THAT WAS THE JOB THAT I HAD AS A LEADER IN THE BUSINESS WORLD , AND THEN AS THE HEAD OF THE OLYMPICS IN UNKNOWNWORD LAKE CITY , AND OF COURSE AS GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS . AND I AM THE ONLY CANDIDATE WITH THAT KIND OF EXPERIENCE , AND FRANKLY , THAT'S EXACTLY THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE THAT MICHIGAN AND AMERICA NEEDS IN THE WHITE HOUSE TODAY . NOW , I KNOW THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO DON'T THINK THAT THERE'S A FUTURE FOR THE DOMESTIC AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY . THEY THINK THAT THE INDUSTRY AND ITS JOBS ARE GONE FOREVER . AND THEY'RE WRONG . INNOVATION AND CHANGE PRESENT THE OPPORTUNITY FOR UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE BURDENS ON AMERICAN MANUFACTURING ARE LARGELY IMPOSED BY GOVERNMENT , AND NEW LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON CAN LIFT THE BURDENS AND LIFT THE INDUSTRY . WASHINGTON POLITICIANS LOOK AT MICHIGAN AND THEY SEE A RUST BELT . BUT THE REAL RUST IS IN WASHINGTON . THE PESSIMIST WILL POINT TO AN EMPTY FACTORY AND A LAID-OFF WORKER AND SAY THEY HAVE NO FUTURE . INSTEAD , I SEE VITAL INFRASTRUCTURE , A SKILLED WORKFORCE , AND AN INNOVATIVE SPIRIT , ALL WORTHY OF AN OPTIMISTIC VISION , AND UNKNOWNWORD OF A LEADER WHO WILL WORK TIRELESSLY TO DELIVER THE POWER AND POTENTIAL OF MICHIGAN AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THE PESSIMIST SAYS THAT THE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF JOBS THAT HAVE BEEN LOST , HAVE BEEN LOST FOREVER . THAT LOGIC OF COURSE SAYS THAT THE 200 JOBS THAT WERE LOST LAST WEEK AT WILLOW RUN , THEY'RE LOST FOREVER TOO . AND BY THE WAY , THAT LOGIC WOULD ALSO SAY THAT ALL THE REST OF THE JOBS IN THE AUTO INDUSTRY WILL ONE DAY BE GONE FOREVER , AND THERE'S NOTHING THAT CAN BE DONE ABOUT IT . WELL , THE PESSIMISTS ARE WRONG . THE AUTO INDUSTRY AND ALL ITS JOBS DO NOT HAVE TO BE LOST . AND I AM ONE MAN WHO WILL WORK TO TRANSFORM THE INDUSTRY AND SAVE THOSE JOBS . NOW , AFTER THIS SPEECH , I AM GOING TO DO WITH MY SON UNKNOWNWORD , WHO'S SITTING RIGHT THERE , WHAT MY DAD DID WITH ME 50 YEARS AGO . WE'RE GOING TO GO TO THE INTERNATIONAL AUTO SHOW WHERE I WILL SHOW HIM THE BEST OF TODAY AND THE VISION OF WHAT WE CAN BE TOMORROW . AND THE NEXT TIME I VISIT THE AUTO SHOW HERE IN DETROIT , I HOPE IT WILL BE AS THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . THANK YOU SO MUCH . THANK YOU !
RED	THANK YOU , MR . PRESIDENT , FOR YOUR KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO BE HERE TODAY . THIS IS AN INSPIRING PLACE BECAUSE OF YOU AND THE FIRST LADY AND BECAUSE OF THE FILM UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE WAY IN THE PRESIDENTIAL LIBRARY . FOR THOSE WHO HAVE NOT SEEN IT , IT SHOWS THE PRESIDENT AS A YOUNG PILOT , SHOT DOWN DURING THE SECOND WORLD WAR , BEING RESCUED FROM HIS LIFE-RAFT BY THE CREW OF AN AMERICAN SUBMARINE . IT IS A MOVING REMINDER THAT WHEN AMERICA HAS FACED CHALLENGE AND PERIL , AMERICANS RISE TO THE OCCASION , WILLING TO RISK THEIR VERY LIVES TO DEFEND FREEDOM AND PRESERVE OUR NATION . WE ARE IN YOUR DEBT . THANK YOU , MR . PRESIDENT . MR . PRESIDENT , YOUR GENERATION ROSE TO THE OCCASION , FIRST TO DEFEAT FASCISM AND THEN TO UNKNOWNWORD THE SOVIET UNION . YOU LEFT US , YOUR CHILDREN , A FREE AND STRONG AMERICA . IT IS WHY WE CALL YOURS THE GREATEST GENERATION . IT IS NOW MY GENERATION'S TURN . HOW WE RESPOND TO TODAY'S CHALLENGES WILL DEFINE OUR GENERATION . AND IT WILL DETERMINE WHAT KIND OF AMERICA WE WILL LEAVE OUR CHILDREN , AND THEIRS . AMERICA FACES A NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES . RADICAL VIOLENT ISLAM SEEKS TO DESTROY US . AN EMERGING CHINA ENDEAVORS TO SURPASS OUR ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP . AND WE ARE TROUBLED AT HOME BY GOVERNMENT OVERSPENDING , OVERUSE OF FOREIGN OIL , AND THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY . OVER THE LAST YEAR , WE HAVE EMBARKED ON A NATIONAL DEBATE ON HOW BEST TO PRESERVE AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . TODAY , I WISH TO ADDRESS A TOPIC WHICH I BELIEVE IS FUNDAMENTAL TO AMERICA'S GREATNESS : OUR RELIGIOUS LIBERTY . I WILL ALSO OFFER UNKNOWNWORD ON HOW MY OWN FAITH WOULD INFORM MY PRESIDENCY , IF I WERE ELECTED . THERE ARE SOME WHO MAY FEEL THAT RELIGION IS NOT A MATTER TO BE SERIOUSLY CONSIDERED IN THE CONTEXT OF THE WEIGHTY THREATS THAT FACE US . IF SO , THEY ARE AT ODDS WITH THE NATION'S FOUNDERS , FOR THEY , WHEN OUR NATION FACED ITS GREATEST PERIL , SOUGHT THE BLESSINGS OF THE CREATOR . AND FURTHER , THEY DISCOVERED THE ESSENTIAL CONNECTION BETWEEN THE SURVIVAL OF A FREE LAND AND THE PROTECTION OF RELIGIOUS FREEDOM . IN JOHN ADAMS ' WORDS : 'WE HAVE NO GOVERNMENT ARMED WITH POWER CAPABLE OF UNKNOWNWORD WITH HUMAN PASSIONS UNBRIDLED BY MORALITY AND RELIGION ... OUR CONSTITUTION WAS MADE FOR A MORAL AND RELIGIOUS PEOPLE .' FREEDOM REQUIRES RELIGION JUST AS RELIGION REQUIRES FREEDOM . FREEDOM OPENS THE WINDOWS OF THE SOUL SO THAT MAN CAN DISCOVER HIS MOST PROFOUND BELIEFS AND COMMUNE WITH GOD . FREEDOM AND RELIGION ENDURE TOGETHER , OR PERISH ALONE . GIVEN OUR GRAND TRADITION OF RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE AND LIBERTY , SOME WONDER WHETHER THERE ARE ANY QUESTIONS REGARDING AN ASPIRING CANDIDATE'S RELIGION THAT ARE APPROPRIATE . I BELIEVE THERE ARE . AND I WILL ANSWER THEM TODAY . ALMOST 50 YEARS AGO ANOTHER CANDIDATE FROM MASSACHUSETTS UNKNOWNWORD THAT HE WAS AN AMERICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT , NOT A CATHOLIC RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT . LIKE HIM , I AM AN AMERICAN RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT . I DO NOT DEFINE MY CANDIDACY BY MY RELIGION . A PERSON SHOULD NOT BE ELECTED BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH NOR SHOULD HE BE REJECTED BECAUSE OF HIS FAITH . LET ME ASSURE YOU THAT NO UNKNOWNWORD OF MY CHURCH , OR OF ANY OTHER CHURCH FOR THAT MATTER , WILL EVER EXERT INFLUENCE ON PRESIDENTIAL DECISIONS . THEIR AUTHORITY IS THEIRS , WITHIN THE PROVINCE OF CHURCH AFFAIRS , AND IT ENDS WHERE THE AFFAIRS OF THE NATION BEGIN . AS GOVERNOR , I TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT AS BEST I KNEW IT , SERVING THE LAW AND ANSWERING TO THE CONSTITUTION . I DID NOT CONFUSE THE PARTICULAR UNKNOWNWORD OF MY CHURCH WITH THE OBLIGATIONS OF THE OFFICE AND OF THE CONSTITUTION . AND OF COURSE , I WOULD NOT DO SO AS PRESIDENT . I WILL PUT NO DOCTRINE OF ANY CHURCH ABOVE THE PLAIN DUTIES OF THE OFFICE AND THE SOVEREIGN AUTHORITY OF THE LAW . AS A YOUNG MAN , UNKNOWNWORD DESCRIBED WHAT HE CALLED AMERICA'S 'POLITICAL RELIGION ' . THE COMMITMENT TO DEFEND THE RULE OF LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION . WHEN I PLACE MY HAND ON THE BIBLE AND TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE , THAT OATH BECOMES MY HIGHEST PROMISE TO GOD . IF I AM FORTUNATE TO BECOME YOUR PRESIDENT , I WILL SERVE NO ONE RELIGION , NO ONE GROUP , NO ONE CAUSE , AND NO ONE INTEREST . A PRESIDENT MUST SERVE ONLY THE COMMON CAUSE OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES . THERE ARE SOME FOR WHOM THESE COMMITMENTS ARE NOT ENOUGH . THEY WOULD PREFER IT IF I WOULD SIMPLY DISTANCE MYSELF FROM MY RELIGION , SAY THAT IT IS MORE A TRADITION THAN MY PERSONAL CONVICTION , OR UNKNOWNWORD ONE OR ANOTHER OF ITS PRECEPTS . THAT I WILL NOT DO . I BELIEVE IN MY MORMON FAITH AND I ENDEAVOR TO LIVE BY IT . MY FAITH IS THE FAITH OF MY FATHERS . I WILL BE TRUE TO THEM AND TO MY BELIEFS . SOME BELIEVE THAT SUCH A CONFESSION OF MY FAITH WILL SINK MY CANDIDACY . IF THEY ARE RIGHT , SO BE IT . BUT I THINK THEY UNKNOWNWORD THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AMERICANS DO NOT RESPECT UNKNOWNWORD OF CONVENIENCE . AMERICANS TIRE OF THOSE WHO WOULD JETTISON THEIR BELIEFS , EVEN TO GAIN THE WORLD . THERE IS ONE FUNDAMENTAL QUESTION ABOUT WHICH I OFTEN AM ASKED . WHAT DO I BELIEVE ABOUT JESUS CHRIST ? I BELIEVE THAT JESUS CHRIST IS THE SON OF GOD AND THE SAVIOR OF MANKIND . MY CHURCH'S BELIEFS ABOUT CHRIST MAY NOT ALL BE THE SAME AS THOSE OF OTHER FAITHS . EACH RELIGION HAS ITS OWN UNIQUE DOCTRINES AND HISTORY . THESE ARE NOT UNKNOWNWORD FOR CRITICISM BUT RATHER A TEST OF OUR TOLERANCE . RELIGIOUS TOLERANCE WOULD BE A SHALLOW PRINCIPLE INDEED IF IT WERE UNKNOWNWORD ONLY FOR FAITHS WITH WHICH WE AGREE . THERE ARE SOME WHO WOULD HAVE A PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE DESCRIBE AND EXPLAIN HIS CHURCH'S DISTINCTIVE DOCTRINES . TO DO SO WOULD ENABLE THE VERY RELIGIOUS TEST THE FOUNDERS PROHIBITED IN THE CONSTITUTION . NO CANDIDATE SHOULD BECOME THE SPOKESMAN FOR HIS FAITH . FOR IF HE BECOMES PRESIDENT HE WILL NEED THE PRAYERS OF THE PEOPLE OF ALL FAITHS . I BELIEVE THAT EVERY FAITH I HAVE ENCOUNTERED DRAWS ITS ADHERENTS CLOSER TO GOD . AND IN EVERY FAITH I HAVE COME TO KNOW , THERE ARE FEATURES I WISH WERE IN MY OWN : I LOVE THE PROFOUND CEREMONY OF THE CATHOLIC MASS , THE APPROACHABILITY OF GOD IN THE PRAYERS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SPIRIT AMONG THE PENTECOSTALS , THE CONFIDENT INDEPENDENCE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , THE ANCIENT TRADITIONS OF THE JEWS , UNCHANGED THROUGH THE AGES , AND THE COMMITMENT TO FREQUENT PRAYER OF THE MUSLIMS . AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND SEE OUR TOWNS AND CITIES , I AM ALWAYS MOVED BY THE MANY HOUSES OF WORSHIP WITH THEIR STEEPLES , ALL POINTING TO HEAVEN , REMINDING US OF THE SOURCE OF LIFE'S BLESSINGS . IT IS IMPORTANT TO RECOGNIZE THAT WHILE DIFFERENCES IN THEOLOGY EXIST BETWEEN THE CHURCHES IN AMERICA , WE SHARE A COMMON CREED OF MORAL CONVICTIONS . AND WHERE THE AFFAIRS OF OUR NATION ARE CONCERNED , IT'S USUALLY A SOUND RULE TO FOCUS ON THE LATTER . ON THE GREAT MORAL PRINCIPLES THAT URGE US ALL ON A COMMON COURSE . WHETHER IT WAS THE CAUSE OF ABOLITION , OR CIVIL RIGHTS , OR THE RIGHT TO LIFE ITSELF , NO MOVEMENT OF CONSCIENCE CAN SUCCEED IN AMERICA THAT CANNOT SPEAK TO THE CONVICTIONS OF RELIGIOUS PEOPLE . WE SEPARATE CHURCH AND STATE AFFAIRS IN THIS COUNTRY , AND FOR GOOD REASON . NO RELIGION SHOULD DICTATE TO THE STATE NOR SHOULD THE STATE INTERFERE WITH THE FREE PRACTICE OF RELIGION . BUT IN RECENT YEARS , THE NOTION OF THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND STATE HAS BEEN TAKEN BY SOME WELL BEYOND ITS ORIGINAL MEANING . THEY SEEK TO REMOVE FROM THE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD ANY ACKNOWLEDGMENT OF GOD . RELIGION IS SEEN AS MERELY A PRIVATE AFFAIR WITH NO PLACE IN PUBLIC LIFE . IT IS AS IF THEY ARE INTENT ON ESTABLISHING A NEW RELIGION IN AMERICA . THE RELIGION OF SECULARISM . THEY ARE WRONG . THE FOUNDERS PROSCRIBED THE ESTABLISHMENT OF A STATE RELIGION , BUT THEY DID NOT COUNTENANCE THE ELIMINATION OF RELIGION FROM THE PUBLIC SQUARE . WE ARE A NATION 'UNDER GOD ' AND IN GOD , WE DO INDEED TRUST . WE SHOULD ACKNOWLEDGE THE CREATOR AS DID THE FOUNDERS . IN CEREMONY AND WORD . HE SHOULD REMAIN ON OUR CURRENCY , IN OUR PLEDGE , IN THE TEACHING OF OUR HISTORY , AND DURING THE HOLIDAY SEASON , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND MENORAHS SHOULD BE WELCOME IN OUR PUBLIC PLACES . OUR GREATNESS WOULD NOT LONG ENDURE WITHOUT JUDGES WHO RESPECT THE FOUNDATION OF FAITH UPON WHICH OUR CONSTITUTION RESTS . I WILL TAKE CARE TO SEPARATE THE AFFAIRS OF GOVERNMENT FROM ANY RELIGION , BUT I WILL NOT SEPARATE US FROM 'THE GOD WHO GAVE US LIBERTY .' NOR WOULD I SEPARATE US FROM OUR RELIGIOUS HERITAGE . PERHAPS THE MOST IMPORTANT QUESTION TO ASK A PERSON OF FAITH WHO SEEKS A POLITICAL OFFICE , IS THIS : DOES HE SHARE THESE AMERICAN VALUES : THE EQUALITY OF HUMAN KIND , THE OBLIGATION TO SERVE ONE ANOTHER , AND A STEADFAST COMMITMENT TO LIBERTY ? THEY ARE NOT UNIQUE TO ANY ONE DENOMINATION . THEY BELONG TO THE GREAT MORAL INHERITANCE WE HOLD IN COMMON . THEY ARE THE FIRM GROUND ON WHICH AMERICANS OF DIFFERENT FAITHS MEET AND STAND AS A NATION , UNITED . WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY SINGLE HUMAN BEING IS A CHILD OF GOD . WE ARE ALL PART OF THE HUMAN FAMILY . THE CONVICTION OF THE INHERENT AND INALIENABLE WORTH OF EVERY LIFE IS STILL THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY POLITICAL PROPOSITION EVER ADVANCED . JOHN ADAMS PUT IT THAT WE ARE 'THROWN INTO THE WORLD ALL EQUAL AND ALIKE .' THE CONSEQUENCE OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO ONE ANOTHER , TO OUR FELLOW AMERICANS FOREMOST , BUT ALSO TO EVERY CHILD OF GOD . IT IS AN OBLIGATION WHICH IS FULFILLED BY AMERICANS EVERY DAY , HERE AND ACROSS THE GLOBE , WITHOUT REGARD TO CREED OR RACE OR NATIONALITY . AMERICANS ACKNOWLEDGE THAT LIBERTY IS A GIFT OF GOD , NOT AN INDULGENCE OF GOVERNMENT . NO PEOPLE IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD HAVE SACRIFICED AS MUCH FOR LIBERTY . THE LIVES OF HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF AMERICA'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS WERE LAID DOWN DURING THE LAST CENTURY TO PRESERVE FREEDOM , FOR US AND FOR FREEDOM LOVING PEOPLE THROUGHOUT THE WORLD . AMERICA TOOK NOTHING FROM THAT CENTURY'S TERRIBLE WARS . NO LAND FROM GERMANY OR JAPAN OR KOREA ; NO TREASURE ; NO OATH OF FEALTY . AMERICA'S RESOLVE IN THE DEFENSE OF LIBERTY HAS BEEN TESTED TIME AND AGAIN . IT HAS NOT BEEN FOUND WANTING , NOR MUST IT EVER BE . AMERICA MUST NEVER FALTER IN HOLDING HIGH THE BANNER OF FREEDOM . THESE AMERICAN VALUES , THIS GREAT MORAL HERITAGE , IS SHARED AND LIVED IN MY RELIGION AS IT IS IN YOURS . I WAS TAUGHT IN MY HOME TO HONOR GOD AND LOVE MY NEIGHBOR . I SAW MY FATHER MARCH WITH MARTIN LUTHER KING . I SAW MY PARENTS PROVIDE COMPASSIONATE CARE TO OTHERS , IN PERSONAL WAYS TO PEOPLE NEARBY , AND IN JUST AS CONSEQUENTIAL WAYS IN LEADING NATIONAL VOLUNTEER MOVEMENTS . I AM MOVED BY THE UNKNOWNWORD WORDS : 'FOR I WAS AN HUNGERED , AND YE GAVE ME MEAT : I WAS THIRSTY , AND YE GAVE ME DRINK : I WAS A STRANGER , AND YE TOOK ME IN : NAKED , AND YE CLOTHED ME ...' MY FAITH IS GROUNDED ON THESE TRUTHS . YOU CAN WITNESS THEM IN ANN AND MY MARRIAGE AND IN OUR FAMILY . WE ARE A LONG WAY FROM PERFECT AND WE HAVE SURELY STUMBLED ALONG THE WAY , BUT OUR ASPIRATIONS , OUR VALUES , ARE THE SELF-SAME AS THOSE FROM THE OTHER FAITHS THAT STAND UPON THIS COMMON FOUNDATION . AND THESE CONVICTIONS WILL INDEED INFORM MY PRESIDENCY . TODAY'S GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN RELIGIOUS LIBERTY . PERHAPS WE FORGET THE LONG AND ARDUOUS PATH OUR NATION'S UNKNOWNWORD TOOK TO ACHIEVE IT . THEY CAME HERE FROM ENGLAND TO SEEK FREEDOM OF RELIGION . BUT UPON FINDING IT FOR THEMSELVES , THEY AT FIRST DENIED IT TO OTHERS . BECAUSE OF THEIR DIVERSE BELIEFS , ANN HUTCHINSON WAS EXILED FROM MASSACHUSETTS BAY , A BANISHED ROGER WILLIAMS FOUNDED RHODE ISLAND , AND TWO CENTURIES LATER , BRIGHAM YOUNG SET OUT FOR THE WEST . AMERICANS WERE UNABLE TO ACCOMMODATE THEIR COMMITMENT TO THEIR OWN FAITH WITH AN APPRECIATION FOR THE CONVICTIONS OF OTHERS TO DIFFERENT FAITHS . IN THIS , THEY WERE VERY MUCH LIKE THOSE OF THE EUROPEAN NATIONS THEY HAD LEFT . IT WAS IN PHILADELPHIA THAT OUR FOUNDING FATHERS DEFINED A REVOLUTIONARY VISION OF LIBERTY , GROUNDED ON SELF EVIDENT TRUTHS ABOUT THE EQUALITY OF ALL , AND THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS WITH WHICH EACH IS ENDOWED BY HIS CREATOR . WE CHERISH THESE SACRED RIGHTS , AND SECURE THEM IN OUR CONSTITUTIONAL ORDER . FOREMOST DO WE PROTECT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY , NOT AS A MATTER OF POLICY BUT AS A MATTER OF RIGHT . THERE WILL BE NO ESTABLISHED CHURCH , AND WE ARE GUARANTEED THE FREE EXERCISE OF OUR RELIGION . I'M NOT SURE THAT WE FULLY APPRECIATE THE PROFOUND IMPLICATIONS OF OUR TRADITION OF RELIGIOUS LIBERTY . I HAVE VISITED MANY OF THE MAGNIFICENT CATHEDRALS IN EUROPE . THEY ARE SO INSPIRED ... SO GRAND ... SO EMPTY . RAISED UP OVER GENERATIONS , LONG AGO , SO MANY OF THE CATHEDRALS NOW STAND AS THE POSTCARD BACKDROP TO SOCIETIES JUST TOO BUSY OR TOO 'ENLIGHTENED ' TO VENTURE INSIDE AND KNEEL IN PRAYER . THE ESTABLISHMENT OF STATE RELIGIONS IN EUROPE DID NO FAVOR TO EUROPE'S CHURCHES . AND THOUGH YOU WILL FIND MANY PEOPLE OF STRONG FAITH THERE , THE CHURCHES THEMSELVES SEEM TO BE UNKNOWNWORD AWAY . INFINITELY WORSE IS THE OTHER EXTREME , THE CREED OF CONVERSION BY CONQUEST : VIOLENT JIHAD , MURDER AS MARTYRDOM ... KILLING CHRISTIANS , JEWS , AND MUSLIMS WITH EQUAL UNKNOWNWORD . THESE RADICAL ISLAMISTS DO THEIR PREACHING NOT BY REASON OR EXAMPLE , BUT IN THE COERCION OF MINDS AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF BLOOD . WE FACE NO GREATER DANGER TODAY THAN UNKNOWNWORD TYRANNY , AND THE BOUNDLESS SUFFERING THESE STATES AND GROUPS COULD INFLICT IF GIVEN THE CHANCE . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR CULTURAL EXPRESSION , AND THE VIBRANCY OF OUR RELIGIOUS DIALOGUE , HAS KEPT AMERICA IN THE FOREFRONT OF CIVILIZED NATIONS EVEN AS OTHERS REGARD RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AS SOMETHING TO BE DESTROYED . IN SUCH A WORLD , WE CAN BE DEEPLY THANKFUL THAT WE LIVE IN A LAND WHERE REASON AND RELIGION ARE FRIENDS AND ALLIES IN THE CAUSE OF LIBERTY , JOINED AGAINST THE EVILS AND DANGERS OF THE DAY . AND YOU CAN BE CERTAIN OF THIS : ANY BELIEVER IN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM , ANY PERSON WHO HAS KNELT IN PRAYER TO THE ALMIGHTY , HAS A FRIEND AND ALLY IN ME . AND SO IT IS FOR HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF OUR COUNTRYMEN : WE DO NOT INSIST ON A SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD OF RELIGION . RATHER , WE WELCOME OUR NATION'S SYMPHONY OF FAITH . RECALL THE EARLY DAYS OF THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD CONGRESS IN PHILADELPHIA , DURING THE FALL OF 1774 . WITH BOSTON UNKNOWNWORD BY BRITISH TROOPS , THERE WERE RUMORS OF IMMINENT HOSTILITIES AND FEARS OF AN IMPENDING WAR . IN THIS TIME OF PERIL , SOMEONE SUGGESTED THAT THEY PRAY . BUT THERE WERE OBJECTIONS . 'THEY WERE TOO DIVIDED IN RELIGIOUS SENTIMENTS ', WHAT WITH EPISCOPALIANS AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND CONGREGATIONALISTS , PRESBYTERIANS AND UNKNOWNWORD . THEN SAM ADAMS ROSE , AND SAID HE WOULD HEAR A PRAYER FROM ANYONE OF PIETY AND GOOD CHARACTER , AS LONG AS THEY WERE A PATRIOT . AND SO TOGETHER THEY PRAYED , AND TOGETHER THEY FOUGHT , AND TOGETHER , BY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF GOD ... THEY FOUNDED THIS GREAT NATION . IN THAT SPIRIT , LET US GIVE THANKS TO THE DIVINE 'AUTHOR OF LIBERTY .' AND TOGETHER , LET US PRAY THAT THIS LAND MAY ALWAYS BE BLESSED , 'WITH FREEDOM'S HOLY LIGHT .' GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
RED	THANK YOU FOR YOUR WARM WELCOME . THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO TO STRENGTHEN FAMILIES AND PROTECT LIFE . I THINK THOSE WHO KNOW ME WOULD SAY THAT I AM UNKNOWNWORD ON EVERY LEVEL , FROM PERSONAL TO POLITICAL . I KNOW THIS : THE GREATEST BLESSING IN MY LIFE IS ANN AND OUR FIVE SONS AND DAUGHTERS-IN-LAW AND TEN GRANDCHILDREN . MY DRIVING MOTIVATION IS TO HAVE OUR KIDS AND GRANDKIDS GROW UP IN AN AMERICA THAT IS SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND STRONG . TO ACHIEVE THAT , IT'S NOT JUST WHAT HAPPENS IN THE WHITE HOUSE THAT MATTERS , IT IS ALSO WHAT HAPPENS IN YOUR HOUSE . AMERICA'S FUTURE WILL BE DETERMINED NOT JUST BY HEADS OF STATE BUT ALSO BY HEADS OF HOUSEHOLDS . THAT BEING SAID , THERE IS A GOOD DEAL THAT OUR NATION CAN DO TO ASSIST AND VALIDATE PARENTS IN THEIR VITAL ROLE . AS C.S . LEWIS SAID , PARENTHOOD IS THE ULTIMATE CAREER 'FOR WHICH ALL OTHERS EXIST .' THAT RINGS TRUE , DOESN'T IT ? THAT MAY BE BECAUSE OF OUR JUDEO-CHRISTIAN HERITAGE . WE HAVE BEEN TAUGHT FROM OUR YOUTH THAT MARRIAGE IS ORDAINED OF GOD AND THAT 'CHILDREN ARE A HERITAGE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD ; HAPPY IS HE WHO HATH HIS UNKNOWNWORD FULL OF THEM .' BUT THERE IS ANOTHER REASON , A SOCIETAL REASON , FOR THE FUNDAMENTAL ROLE OF FAMILY . FAMILY IS THE BUILDING BLOCK OF THE NATION ; IT IS THE ECONOMIC UNIT OF OUR SOCIETY . THIS IS NOT JUST RHETORIC . IT IS REALITY . A MOTHER AND FATHER WHO LOVE EACH OTHER AND ARE DEVOTED TO THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE CHILDREN THAT ARE BETTER EDUCATED , BETTER ADJUSTED , HEALTHIER , LESS LIKELY TO BE RAISED IN POVERTY AND LESS INCLINED TO CRIME AND DRUGS . WITH TWO PARENTS , THERE ARE MORE FINANCIAL RESOURCES AND MORE TIME TO DEVOTE TO THE NEXT GENERATION . AND THERE IS SOMEONE AROUND TO TAKE OVER WHEN ONE PARENT IS AT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD END WITH THE KIDS ! FAMILY ALSO MEANS THAT THERE IS A COMPASSIONATE CAREGIVER WHEN THE INEVITABLE SICKNESS OR INFIRMITY STRIKES A FAMILY MEMBER . AND WHEN YOU CONSIDER THE SOURCE OF MOST OF UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL PROBLEMS , FROM UNKNOWNWORD PREGNANCY TO DRUG USE TO CRIME , YOU WILL FIND THAT THEY STEM FROM THE BREAKDOWN OF THE FAMILY . FOR ALL THESE REASONS , A SOCIETY IS WEALTHIER , HEALTHIER AND STRONGER WHEN IT HAS STRONG FAMILIES . IN AMERICA , THEN , THE FAMILY IS A VITAL ECONOMIC UNIT , THE FOUNDATION OF OUR NATION . AND IT IS THE STRENGTH OF THIS NATION'S FAMILIES THAT ULTIMATELY DETERMINES AMERICA'S STRENGTH IN THE FAMILY OF NATIONS . THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK FOR THE FUTURE OF AMERICA IS THE WORK THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF THE AMERICAN HOME . OF COURSE , NOT ALL FAMILIES WILL HAVE TWO LOVING PARENTS . THERE ARE MANY GREAT SINGLE PARENTS . LIKE MY SISTER JANE , WHO RAISED FOUR WONDERFUL CHILDREN ON HER OWN . SO NOT ALWAYS , BUT IN THE VAST NUMBERS OF AN ENTIRE NATION , TWO PARENTS ARE THE IDEAL SETTING FOR RAISING A CHILD , AND FOR FORMING THE ECONOMIC UNIT OF SOCIETY . I CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TO TELL THE FAMILY RESEARCH COUNCIL AND FOCUS ON THE FAMILY THAT THE AMERICAN FAMILY IS UNDER STRESS , AND UNDER ATTACK . ONE OF THE BIGGEST THREATS TO THE FABRIC OF OUR SOCIETY IS OUT-OF-WEDLOCK CHILDBIRTH . ANN AND I WILL USE THE BULLY PULPIT TO TEACH AMERICA'S CHILDREN THAT BEFORE THEY HAVE BABIES , THEY SHOULD GET MARRIED . IT'S TIME TO MAKE OUT-OF-WEDLOCK BIRTHS OUT-OF-FASHION AGAIN . IN 1965 , A RESEARCHER NAMED DANIEL PATRICK MOYNIHAN WAS TROUBLED BY AN ALARMING STATISTIC . APPROXIMATELY 25 % OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN WERE BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK . HOW WOULD THEY ESCAPE POVERTY ? TODAY , NOT 25 % BUT 68 % OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN CHILDREN ARE BORN OUT OF WEDLOCK . BILL COSBY RELATED THAT IN SOME INNER CITIES : 'THERE ARE WHOLE BLOCKS WITH SCARCELY A MARRIED COUPLE , WHOLE BLOCKS WITHOUT RESPONSIBLE MALES TO WATCH OUT FOR WAYWARD BOYS , WHOLE NEIGHBORHOODS IN WHICH LITTLE BOYS AND GIRLS COME OF AGE WITHOUT SEEING UP CLOSE A COMMITTED RELATIONSHIP AND PERHAPS NEVER HAVING ATTENDED A WEDDING .' THIS SIMPLY BREAKS MY HEART . AND THEN THERE ARE THE BROAD NATIONAL IMPLICATIONS OF THIS TRAGEDY . A NATION BUILT ON THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FOUNDING FATHERS CANNOT THRIVE WHEN SO MANY CHILDREN ARE BEING RAISED WITHOUT FATHERS IN THE HOME . ANN TAUGHT A CLASS OF AT-RISK GIRLS AT MOTHER CAROLINE ACADEMY IN BOSTON . ONE DAY SHE ASKED HER 5TH GRADERS HOW MANY OF THEM WANTED TO GO TO COLLEGE . ALMOST EVERY HAND WENT UP . THEN SHE ASKED HOW MANY WERE PLANNING ON HAVING A BABY BEFORE THEY GRADUATED FROM HIGH SCHOOL . ALMOST EVERY HAND WENT UP AGAIN . AND THEN SHE TOLD THEM THE TRUTH : YOU JUST WON'T BE ABLE TO DO BOTH . EVERY FIRST LADY CHAMPIONS A CAUSE . FOR NANCY REAGAN , IT WAS TO JUST SAY NO TO DRUGS . FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD BUSH , IT HAS BEEN READING . ANN HAS WORKED TO HELP CHILDREN MAKE GOOD CHOICES LIKE MARRIAGE AND HIGH SCHOOL BEFORE HAVING BABIES . IF SHE IS FIRST LADY , THIS WILL BE HER MISSION . AND IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WILL CONVENE A WHITE HOUSE SUMMIT TO LOOK AT WAYS WE CAN STRENGTHEN THE FAMILY , PARTICULARLY IN THE INNER CITY . IN ADDITION TO USING THE BULLY PULPIT , THERE ARE SPECIFIC POLICY INITIATIVES THAT I'D LIKE TO BRING FORWARD , AS WELL AS SOME GOALS WE CAN SET TO ACCOMPLISH TOGETHER . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT INCENTIVES TO ENCOURAGE MARRIAGE , NOT PENALIZE IT . AS WE ALL KNOW , FEW THINGS HAD AS DEVASTATING AN IMPACT ON POOR FAMILIES AS THE 1960'S WELFARE SYSTEM . TO SOME DEGREE , THAT HAS BEEN REFORMED , BUT THERE IS MORE WORK TO DO . FOR EXAMPLE , A SINGLE MOTHER WITH CHILD CARE WHO MARRIES THE FATHER OF HER CHILD CAN LOSE AS MUCH AS $6,000 A YEAR IN GOVERNMENT BENEFITS . THEIR COMBINED INCOMES CAN DISQUALIFY THEM FOR MEDICAID , HOUSING VOUCHERS , FOOD STAMPS AND WELFARE . IT IS TIME THAT WE MADE FATHERS RESPONSIBLE FOR THEIR CHILD'S HEALTH AND CARE , WHETHER OR NOT THEY HAVE MARRIED THE MOTHER . AND FURTHER , THE TAX PENALTY WE ATTACH TO MARRIED COUPLES IS SIMPLY OFFENSIVE . THE WORDS 'I DO ' IN MARRIAGE SHOULD NOT RESULT IN THE GOVERNMENT SAYING 'YOU DON'T ' WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF A FAMILY . SOME YEARS AGO , DR . DOBSON MET WITH PRESIDENT REAGAN TO DETERMINE HOW THEY COULD KEEP GOVERNMENT FROM DOING THINGS THAT HURT FAMILIES AND THAT WEAKENED THE FAMILY STRUCTURE IN AMERICA . THIS MEETING LED THE PRESIDENT TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER WHICH ESTABLISHED THE REQUIREMENT THAT NEW GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND PROGRAMS BE SUBJECT TO A FAMILY IMPACT STATEMENT . AND THEN YEARS LATER , WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OR REASON , BILL CLINTON SIMPLY SNUFFED IT OUT . IF I BECOME PRESIDENT , I WILL RE-INSTATE THE FAMILY IMPACT STATEMENT . IN ADDITION , I WILL INITIATE AN UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL CURRENT PROGRAMS AND POLICIES WHICH UNKNOWNWORD IMPACT FAMILIES . AND I WILL LOOK TO SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF PARENTS WHO ARE NOT ALWAYS CONSULTED ABOUT DECISIONS AFFECTING THEIR CHILDREN . THERE IS SOMETHING WRONG WHEN A SCHOOL CAN TELL A PARENT THAT THEY HAVE NO RIGHT TO REMOVE THEIR SECOND GRADER FROM A CLASS WHERE THEY ARE TEACHING ABOUT SAME-SEX MARRIAGE . THE WORK OF BEING A PARENT IS HARD ENOUGH WITHOUT THE GOVERNMENT MAKING IT HARDER . I WILL WORK WITH THE PEOPLE IN THIS ROOM , AS I HAVE FOR THE PAST FOUR YEARS , TO CHAMPION A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE AS THE UNION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN . WITHIN MONTHS OF TAKING OFFICE AS GOVERNOR , THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT GOT THE GAY MARRIAGE BALL ROLLING . THEY SAID IT WAS IN OUR STATE CONSTITUTION . JOHN ADAMS , WHO WROTE IT , WOULD BE SURPRISED . IT WAS NOT IN OUR CONSTITUTION , BUT IT WAS IN THE HEADS OF A ONE VOTE MAJORITY ON THE BENCH TO BIRTH NEW LAW WITHOUT THE BENEFIT OF DEMOCRACY . THE COURT'S ERROR I BELIEVE WAS THAT IT FOCUSED ON ADULT RIGHTS . IF HETEROSEXUAL COUPLES CAN MARRY , IT REASONED , THEN TO HAVE EQUAL RIGHTS , UNKNOWNWORD COUPLES SHOULD ALSO BE ABLE TO MARRY . BUT THEY FORGOT THAT ONE OF THE PRIMARY PURPOSES OF MARRIAGE IS THE DEVELOPMENT AND NURTURING OF CHILDREN . EVERY CHILD DESERVES A MOTHER AND A FATHER . THE COURT'S OPINION IS AS ASTONISHING AS ITS RULING . IT SAID THAT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN 'WORKS A DEEP AND SCARRING HARDSHIP...FOR NO RATIONAL REASON .' NO RATIONAL REASON ? HOW ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND PRESERVATION OF OUR CIVILIZATION ? AND THIS IS NO LONGER JUST A MASSACHUSETTS ISSUE . AS RECENTLY AS A FEW MONTHS AGO , A JUDGE IN IOWA SAID THAT GAY COUPLES HAVE THE RIGHT TO MARRY BECAUSE CURRENT MARRIAGE LAW 'OPERATES ONLY TO HARM SAME SEX COUPLES AND THEIR CHILDREN .' ASTONISHING . AFTER THE RULING IN MASSACHUSETTS , I TESTIFIED IN WASHINGTON IN FAVOR OF A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT . I WROTE EVERY REPUBLICAN U.S . SENATOR TO SUPPORT IT . BUT EVEN SOME OF OUR OWN VOTED AGAINST IT . MAKE NO MISTAKE : A FEDERAL AMENDMENT IS THE ONLY WAY WE CAN PROTECT MARRIAGE FROM LIBERAL , UNELECTED JUDGES . I WILL BE A PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT . I WILL APPOINT AND FIGHT FOR JUSTICES WHO FOLLOW THE LAW AND THE CONSTITUTION , WHO UNDERSTAND JUDICIAL RESTRAINT AND WHO WON'T LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH . BUT BEING A PRO-LIFE PRESIDENT ALSO MEANS PROMOTING POLICIES THAT REFLECT OUR RESPECT FOR THE SANCTITY OF LIFE . I WILL OPPOSE TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION , OPPOSE PARTIAL BIRTH ABORTION , OPPOSE ABORTION IN MILITARY CLINICS , OPPOSE FUNDING ABORTION IN INTERNATIONAL AID PROGRAMS , AND I WILL WORK TO BAN EMBRYONIC CLONING . I WILL WORK TO INCREASE ADOPTIONS BY MAKING THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT PERMANENT AND RAISING AWARENESS ABOUT EMBRYONIC ADOPTION , OR SNOWFLAKE BABIES . AND YOU DON'T HAVE TO TAKE MY WORD FOR IT , YOU CAN LOOK AT MY RECORD AS GOVERNOR . ON EVERY PIECE OF LEGISLATION , I CAME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF LIFE . I WAS HONORED TO RECEIVE THE POLITICAL LEADERSHIP AWARD FROM MASSACHUSETTS CITIZENS FOR LIFE IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACTIONS I TOOK AS GOVERNOR TO PROTECT LIFE . I AM GRATEFUL FOR THE WORK ALL OF YOU HAVE DONE FOR YEARS ON THIS ISSUE . LIKE RONALD REAGAN AND HENRY HYDE , I AM A CONVERT TO THIS CAUSE . I HAVE JOINED THE FIGHT TO WIN THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF OTHERS , AND TO WORK TO CREATE A CULTURE OF LIFE . I WILL FIGHT THE MODERN PLAGUE OF INTERNET PORNOGRAPHY , ESPECIALLY AS IT EFFECTS OUR YOUTH . FOLLOWING THE COLUMBINE SHOOTING , PEGGY NOONAN SAID THAT OUR CHILDREN ARE SWIMMING IN AN OCEAN OF FILTH . PORNOGRAPHY , PERVERSIONS , VIOLENCE AND SEX . IT'S TIME WE NOT ONLY CLEAN UP THAT WATER OUR KIDS ARE SWIMMING IN . COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY HAS GIVEN NEW MEANING TO THE WORDS 'HOME INVASION .' IF I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL WORK TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY COMPUTER SOLD INTO THE HOME HAS AN EASY TO ENGAGE PORNOGRAPHY FILTER SO THAT EVERY PARENT CAN PROTECT THEIR CHILD FROM UNWANTED FILTH . AND THESE PREDATORS WHO USE THE INTERNET TO UNKNOWNWORD IN CHILDREN ? IN MY BOOK , IT'S ONE STRIKE AND YOU'RE OURS . LONG PRISON SENTENCES FOLLOWED BY ANKLE BRACELETS FOR THE REST OF THEIR LIVES . I WILL TAKE THE CAMPAIGN AGAINST DRUGS TO A NEW LEVEL . WE CAN DO A BETTER JOB EDUCATING OUR KIDS ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF DRUG USE . PARENTS MAY BE THE BEST ANTI-DRUG THERE IS . A STUDY REPORTED LAST MONTH THAT YOUNG CHILDREN WHO COME FROM HOMES WHERE FAMILIES HAD DINNER TOGETHER FIVE TIMES A WEEK OR MORE WERE 1/6TH AS LIKELY TO HAVE USED DRUGS . DR . DOBSON FAMOUSLY WROTE THAT 'PARENTING ISN'T FOR COWARDS .' I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS TO RAISE KIDS IN TODAY'S WORLD . I WANT TO HELP FAMILIES BY MAKING SURE THAT EVERY FAMILY HAS HEALTH CARE . MY PLAN GETS EVERY CITIZEN INSURED , WITHOUT NEW TAXES AND WITHOUT HILLARYCARE AND SOCIALIZED MEDICINE . WE PUT A PLAN TO WORK IN MASSACHUSETTS AND ALREADY , THE RANKS OF THE UNINSURED HAVE BEEN CUT IN HALF . I WILL WORK FOR BETTER SCHOOLS AND BETTER EDUCATION FOR OUR CHILDREN . I WANT SCHOOL CHOICE . EVERY CHILD SHOULD HAVE AN EQUAL OPPORTUNITY TO HAVE A GOOD EDUCATION . I FOUGHT AND WON THE FIGHT TO ADD CHARTER SCHOOLS IN MASSACHUSETTS . AND BY THE WAY , LET'S DO SOMETHING TO HELP PARENTS WHO ARE HOME SCHOOLING WITH A FEDERAL TAX CREDIT TO HELP DEFRAY THE COST OF THEIR HOME SCHOOLING EXPENSES . I WANT TO HELP PARENTS SAVE FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE EDUCATION . MY TAX PLAN SAYS THAT FOR EVERY FAMILY EARNING $200,000 A YEAR OR LESS , THE NEW TAX RATE ON THEIR INTEREST , DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS WILL BE ABSOLUTELY ZERO . I WILL DEFEND AMERICA'S RELIGIOUS HERITAGE . I AM CONVINCED THAT A FAMILY WITH FAITH , A FAMILY WITH A PASTOR OR OTHER ADULT WHO CARES ABOUT EVERY CHILD , HAS A DISTINCT ADVANTAGE IN GUIDING CHILDREN TO SUCCESSFUL ADULTHOOD . I WILL MAKE SURE MY ATTORNEY GENERAL DEFENDS THE FREE EXERCISE OF RELIGION . THE EFFORT TO ESTABLISH AN ANTI-RELIGION IN AMERICA , THE ANTI-RELIGION OF SECULARISM , HAS GOT TO COME TO AN END . WE ARE A NATION UNDER GOD , AND WE DO PLACE OUR TRUST IN HIM . BY THE WAY . A FEW OF YOU MAY HAVE HEARD THAT I'M A MORMON . I UNDERSTAND THAT SOME PEOPLE THINK THEY COULDN'T SUPPORT SOMEONE OF MY FAITH . THAT MAY BE BECAUSE THEY'VE LISTENED TO HARRY REID . ACTUALLY , I'M PLEASED THAT SO MANY PEOPLE OF SO MANY FAITHS HAVE COME TO ENDORSE MY CANDIDACY AND MY MESSAGE . MY CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT CHANGING WASHINGTON TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA : I WANT TO BUILD A STRONGER MILITARY , A STRONGER ECONOMY , AND STRONGER FAMILIES . I CALL THESE THE THREE LEGS OF THE REPUBLICAN STOOL . THESE THREE UNITE THE COALITION OF CONSERVATIVES THAT RONALD REAGAN CHAMPIONED . DEFENSE CONSERVATIVES , ECONOMIC CONSERVATIVES , AND SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES . WE WON'T WIN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH ONLY TWO OUT OF THREE OR ONE OUT OF THREE . REPUBLICANS WIN THE WHITE HOUSE BY MOTIVATING ALL THREE PARTS OF OUR COALITION TO CARRY US TO VICTORY . WE'RE NOT GOING TO BEAT HILLARY CLINTON BY ACTING LIKE HILLARY CLINTON . MY WHOLE FAMILY HAS BEEN WORKING ON MY CAMPAIGN . AND WE'VE LOVED IT . BUT WE TAKE THIS QUITE SERIOUSLY AS WELL . WE KNOW THAT IF WE WIN YOUR VOTE FOR THE PRESIDENCY , WE WILL BE EXPECTED TO LIVE BY A HIGHER STANDARD . EVERYTHING WE DO WILL BE UNDER A MICROSCOPE , WHETHER WE LIKE IT OR NOT . THE FIRST FAMILY REPRESENTS AMERICA TO THE WORLD , AND JUST AS IMPORTANT , IT REPRESENTS AMERICA TO YOUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . WE WILL LIVE UP TO A HIGHER STANDARD . OUR FAMILY IS FAR FROM PERFECT , BUT WE'LL ALWAYS TRY TO MAKE YOU PROUD . THIS , AFTER ALL , IS WHY I AM RUNNING . TO STRENGTHEN OUR NATION SO THAT OUR CHILDREN AND YOURS WILL HAVE A SAFE AND FREE AND PROSPEROUS FUTURE . AND TO STRENGTHEN OUR NATION , WE MUST BEGIN BY STRENGTHENING THE FAMILY . IT IS THE PLACE WHERE AMERICA'S FUTURE IS BORN , AND WHERE IT IS SHAPED . I NEED YOUR HELP IN THIS CAUSE . YOU KNOW THE IMPORTANCE OF THE FAMILY . YOU KNOW WHAT WE MUST DO . I CAN'T WAIT FOR US TO DO IT TOGETHER . THANK YOU , AND GOD BLESS YOU .
RED	IT'S GOOD TO BE BACK HOME IN MACKINAC . ONE OF THE THINGS I LIKE BEST IS THAT THERE ARE NO CARS ON THE ISLAND . UNFORTUNATELY , THAT'S AL GORE'S VISION FOR ALL OF AMERICA . I SPENT A FEW GREAT SUMMERS HERE . UP IN THAT BIG WHITE HOME ON THE HILL . WE NEED TO GET A REPUBLICAN FAMILY BACK IN THERE AGAIN . AND WE NEED TO KEEP A REPUBLICAN FAMILY IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN WASHINGTON AS WELL ! I DON'T HAVE TO TELL YOU THAT MY DAD MADE A MARK ON MICHIGAN . AND HE MADE A MARK ON ME . AND I GUESS THAT IS AT THE HEART OF THINGS ; HE'S A BIG PART OF WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TODAY . IN 1957 , WHEN HE WAS THE PRESIDENT OF AMERICAN MOTORS , HE GAVE A SPEECH IN WHICH HE REPORTED THE FOLLOWING CONVERSATION : UNKNOWNWORD NINE YEAR OLD SON ' . THAT WOULD BE ME . UNKNOWNWORD HOME FROM SCHOOL AND SAID MOM , WE REALLY BUILD THE BEST CARS , DON'T WE ?' SHE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD MITT , OF COURSE WE DO . WHY DO YOU ASK ?' 'WELL , IF WE BUILD THE BEST CARS , WHY IS IT THAT LESS THAN THREE PERCENT OF THE PEOPLE AGREE WITH US ?' AFTER MY DAD HEARD OF THIS CONVERSATION , HE TOOK ME ASIDE AND SAID , 'LOOK , MITT , SIZE DOESN'T ALWAYS INDICATE STRENGTH AND POPULARITY DOESN'T ALWAYS INDICATE TRUTH , AND SALES VOLUME DOESN'T ALWAYS INDICATE VALUE .' AND THEN HE ADDED : 'RIGHT ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD .' QUITE A DAD , TEACHING LESSONS LIKE THAT TO HIS NINE YEAR OLD SON . LESSONS I HAVE TAKEN TO HEART . NOW , A FEW YEARS OLDER , AS I HAVE LOOKED AT THE HISTORY OF THIS NATION , I HAVE BECOME CONVINCED THAT RIGHT DOES INDEED PREVAIL . AMERICA HAS FACED AND OVERCOME GREAT CHALLENGES . THESE HAVE BECOME DEFINING MOMENTS , INFLECTION POINTS , WHERE THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY HAS CHANGED . I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE AT AN INFLECTION POINT TODAY . FORCES OF GLOBALIZATION , THE EMERGENCE OF NEW ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD LIKE CHINA AND INDIA , AND THE SPREAD OF RADICAL VIOLENT JIHAD HAVE CREATED A PERFECT STORM THAT WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF OUR NATION . AND , WE FACE UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES IN SECURING OUR BORDERS , PROTECTING THE FAMILY , CREATING NEW JOBS AND ACHIEVING ENERGY SECURITY . THE PEOPLE OF THIS GREAT NATION HAVE ALWAYS TAKEN A HAND IN SHAPING OUR OWN DESTINY . I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION ONCE AGAIN , AS WE HAVE ALWAYS DONE BEFORE . BUT AT THIS CRITICAL TIME IN OUR NATION'S HISTORY , WASHINGTON IS FAILING US . I THINK WE'D HAVE TO ADMIT THAT THE BLAME DOESN'T ALL BELONG TO THE DEMOCRATS . WE REPUBLICANS HAVE TO PUT OUR OWN HOUSE IN ORDER . WE CAN'T BE LIKE DEMOCRATS . A PARTY OF BIG UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN'T PRETEND OUR BORDERS ARE SECURE FROM ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION . WE CAN'T HAVE ETHICAL STANDARDS THAT ARE A PUNCH LINE FOR JAY LENO . WHEN REPUBLICANS ACT LIKE DEMOCRATS , AMERICA LOSES . WE'VE GOT TO START ACTING LIKE REPUBLICANS , NOT EARMARKING REPUBLICANS , NOT BIG GOVERNMENT REPUBLICANS , BUT LIKE REAGAN REPUBLICANS AND TEDDY ROOSEVELT REPUBLICANS . THEY LED US ALONG THE RIGHT COURSE . IT'S TIME FOR US TO SHOW THE CONFIDENCE MY DAD HAD THAT RIGHT WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL . IT'S TIME FOR CHANGE IN WASHINGTON AND CHANGE BEGINS WITH US . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE BELIEVE IN SMALL GOVERNMENT . GOVERNMENTS SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THE FREEDOMS AND VITALITY OF INDIVIDUALS AND ENTERPRISES CAN BE UNLEASHED . COMPARED TO FREE MARKETS AND FREE ENTERPRISES , GOVERNMENT IS SLOW TO ACT , WASTEFUL , UNKNOWNWORD , BUREAUCRATIC , INEFFICIENT , INEFFECTIVE , AND UNRESPONSIVE . HAVE I LEFT ANYTHING OUT ? OTHER THAN THAT , GOVERNMENT ISN'T ALL BAD . HILLARY CLINTON FUNDAMENTALLY DOESN'T TRUST THE PRIVATE SECTOR . OF COURSE NOT , SHE'S NEVER WORKED IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR , EXCEPT TO UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE . SO WHEN SHE SEES A PROBLEM IN THE MARKETPLACE , SHE NATURALLY THINKS MORE GOVERNMENT AND HIGHER TAXES ARE THE SOLUTION . SHE SEES THE PROBLEMS IN HEALTHCARE , FOR EXAMPLE , AND UNKNOWNWORD MORE GOVERNMENT . WITH HER PLAN , PATIENTS WOULD HAVE TO GET USED TO HEARING THESE WORDS : 'THE UNKNOWNWORD WILL SEE YOU NOW .' THE RIGHT ANSWER IS LESS GOVERNMENT , LESS REGULATION , MORE INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITY , AND MORE OF THE MARKET DYNAMICS THAT PROPEL THE REST OF OUR ECONOMY . THIS IS WHY I UNKNOWNWORD THAT HILLARYCARE VERSION UNKNOWNWORD WILL MEET THE SAME FATE AS VERSION ONE : IGNOMINIOUS DEFEAT . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE LIKE SMALL GOVERNMENT . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE ARE ALSO FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE . WE REFUSE TO CHARGE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN FOR OUR EXCESSIVE SPENDING . EVEN IN MASSACHUSETTS FACING A NEARLY $3 BILLION BUDGET GAP , THE LEGISLATURE AND I BALANCED THE BUDGET EVERY YEAR AND REPLENISHED THE RAINY DAY FUND , WITHOUT RAISING TAXES AND WITHOUT RAISING OUR BORROWING CAP . NOW IT'S WASHINGTON'S TURN TO DO THE SAME . IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WILL CAP NON-MILITARY DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AT INFLATION LESS ONE PERCENT . IF I GET APPROPRIATIONS ABOVE THAT AMOUNT , I WILL VETO THEM . AND I LIKE VETOES . I'VE VETOED HUNDREDS OF ITEMS ALREADY . LET'S PUT SOME UNKNOWNWORD INK IN THE PRESIDENTIAL VETO PEN ! HERE IN MICHIGAN , GOVERNOR GRANHOLM HAS TAKEN THIS STATE TO THE BRINK . BY NOT RESTRUCTURING STATE PROGRAMS AND BY NOT SHRINKING GOVERNMENT , SHE HAS PRECIPITATED A UNKNOWNWORD CHOICE . RAISE TAXES OR SHUT DOWN GOVERNMENT . IF YOU LIKE WHAT GOVERNOR GRANHOLM HAS DONE TO MICHIGAN , YOU'LL LOVE WHAT A PRESIDENT HILLARY CLINTON WOULD DO TO AMERICA . LET'S MAKE SURE AMERICA DOESN'T MAKE THE SAME MISTAKE MICHIGAN MADE LAST NOVEMBER ! REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE BELIEVE IN STRENGTH . WE KNOW THAT THE BEST FOE AGAINST TYRANTS AND THE BEST ALLY PEACE HAS EVER KNOWN IS A STRONG AMERICA . WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE MILITARY WITH MORE TROOPS , BETTER ARMAMENT , AND BETTER CARE FOR OUR VETERANS . WE WILL ALSO STRENGTHEN OUR ECONOMY WITH LOWER TAXES AND ENERGY SECURITY . AND WE WILL STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN FAMILY . THERE IS NO WORK MORE IMPORTANT TO THE FUTURE OF AMERICA THAN THE WORK THAT GOES ON WITHIN THE FOUR WALLS OF THE AMERICAN HOME . THE AMERICAN FAMILY IS THE FOUNDATION UPON WHICH THIS COUNTRY'S GREATNESS HAS BEEN BUILT , BUT IT IS A FOUNDATION IN NEED OF SHORING UP . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE KNOW HOW TO RUN A UNKNOWNWORD SHIP . THE KATRINA CLEAN-UP DIDN'T LOOK LIKE REPUBLICANS WERE IN CHARGE . WE NEED TO BRING MORE ACCOUNTABILITY BACK TO WASHINGTON . YOU HAVE HEARD OF THE SUB-PRIME CREDIT CRISIS . WELL , THERE'S A GOVERNMENT AGENCY THAT'S SUPPOSED TO PREVENT PROBLEMS LIKE THAT FROM UNKNOWNWORD , WARNING CONSUMERS , WARNING LENDERS . BUT THEY DIDN'T DO THEIR JOB . AND DO YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN ? CONGRESS WILL GIVE THEM MORE MONEY . DO YOU KNOW WHAT SHOULD HAPPEN ? HEADS SHOULD ROLL . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE HAVE HIGH ETHICAL STANDARDS . I'M TIRED OF HEARING WASHINGTON OFFICIALS REMIND US THAT EVERYONE MAKES MISTAKES . YES , BUT NOT EVERYONE IS A CONGRESSMAN OR A SENATOR OR A PRESIDENT . THEY ASKED FOR THIS JOB AND ASKED FOR OUR TRUST . THEY REPRESENT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THEY ARE HELD UP BEFORE OUR CHILDREN . WE EXPECT HIGHER STANDARDS OF ETHICAL CONDUCT FROM WASHINGTON . WE EXPECT OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO BE GOOD ROLE MODELS , NOT BAD EXAMPLES . THANK YOU PRESIDENT BUSH FOR RESTORING PERSONAL UNKNOWNWORD AND DIGNITY TO THE WHITE HOUSE . AND I CAN GUARANTEE YOU , ANN AND I WILL DO NOTHING THAT WOULD EMBARRASS THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA ! PRESIDENTS LEAD BY EXAMPLE . AND SO , IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , ONE OF MY FIRST ACTS WILL BE TO ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER PROHIBITING THE IMMEDIATE FAMILY OF MY UNKNOWNWORD AND SENIOR STAFF FROM LOBBYING THE EXECUTIVE BRANCH . THE STANDARD FOR HIGH ETHICAL CONDUCT HAS TO BE SET AT THE TOP . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE ARE RESPECTFUL AND CIVIL . WE WILL WORK WITH GOOD DEMOCRATS , DEMOCRATS WHO ALSO LOVE AMERICA , TO CHANGE WASHINGTON AND CONFRONT THE NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES WE FACE . THE POLITICAL ATMOSPHERE IN WASHINGTON HAS BECOME SO TOXIC , WE ARE IN DANGER OF WEAKENING OURSELVES FROM WITHIN . AMERICA NEEDS UNIFYING LEADERSHIP . I'VE FOUND THAT WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND WITH DEMOCRATS FROM TIME TO TIME . I LOVE WHAT RONALD REAGAN SAID 'IT'S NOT THAT LIBERALS ARE IGNORANT , IT'S JUST THAT WHAT THEY KNOW IS WRONG !' WELL , WE CAN TEACH THEM NOW AND THEN , AND WHEN WE DO , AMERICA WINS . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE AREN'T AFRAID TO TACKLE BIG PROBLEMS . NONE IS GREATER THAN THE SPREAD OF RADICAL , VIOLENT JIHADISM . JOHN EDWARDS SAYS THERE IS NO WAR ON TERROR . IT'S JUST A BUMPER STICKER . TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF INDONESIA , MALAYSIA AND BALI . TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF TANZANIA , KENYA AND SPAIN . TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF LONDON , WASHINGTON AND NEW YORK CITY . THERE IS A WAR BEING WAGED AGAINST US BY THE TERRORISTS FOR THE FUTURE OF OUR CIVILIZATION , AND IF I AM PRESIDENT , THE WAR AGAINST THE TERRORISTS WILL BE WON ! LET'S NOT FORGET THAT OUR PRESIDENT HAS KEPT US SAFE THESE LAST SIX YEARS . AND IT HAS NOT BEEN EASY . HE FOUGHT FOR THE PATRIOT ACT . HE LISTENED WHEN AL-QAEDA WAS PLOTTING . HE INTERROGATED TERRORISTS . WHEN KHALID SHEIK MOHAMMAD , THE SO-CALLED MASTERMIND OF 9/11 WAS CAPTURED , HE TOLD HIS CAPTORS , 'I'LL SEE YOU IN NEW YORK WITH MY LAWYERS .' THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN . INSTEAD , HE SAW GI'S AND CIA INTERROGATORS AT GUANTANAMO , AND THAT'S JUST THE WAY IT OUGHT TO BE ! REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE FIGHT TO PROTECT THE FAMILY . THE FAMILY IS UNDER ATTACK . OUR CHILDREN NEED TO BE TAUGHT THAT BEFORE THEY HAVE BABIES , THEY NEED TO GET MARRIED . OUT-OF-WEDLOCK CHILDBIRTH SHOULD ONCE AGAIN BE OUT OF FASHION . THERE ARE DIFFERENT KINDS OF FAMILIES , MANY DOING A HEROIC JOB UNDER DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES . THE IDEAL SETTING FOR RAISING A CHILD IS AND WILL ALWAYS BE WHERE THERE IS A MOTHER AND A FATHER . SOME LIBERAL JUDGES DON'T SEE IT THAT WAY . THAT IS WHY IT IS TIME FOR A FEDERAL AMENDMENT THAT DEFINES MARRIAGE AS THE UNION OF A MAN AND A WOMAN ! AFTER THE COLUMBINE SCHOOL SHOOTING , PEGGY NOONAN WROTE THAT OUR KIDS ARE SWIMMING IN AN OCEAN OF FILTH . PORNOGRAPHY , SEX , VIOLENCE , PERVERSION . THE BOYS WHO DID THE SHOOTING , SHE SAID , HAD DRUNK TOO DEEP OF THE POLLUTED WATER . IT'S TIME TO CLEAN UP THE WATER OUR KIDS ARE SWIMMING IN . I WILL MAKE SURE EVERY HOME COMPUTER HAS AN EASY TO ENGAGE FILTER TO KEEP FILTH OUT OF OUR HOMES . I WANT TO ENFORCE OUR UNKNOWNWORD LAWS . AND FOR THOSE WHO USE THE INTERNET TO FIND CHILDREN FOR THEIR PERVERTED ABUSE , I SAY , UNKNOWNWORD STRIKE AND YOU'RE OURS !' YOU'LL BE FACING A LONG PRISON SENTENCE , AND WHEN YOU GET OUT , A GPS TRACKING DEVICE FOR THE REST OF YOUR LIFE . REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE AREN'T AFRAID TO TALK ABOUT FAITH . WE RECOGNIZE THE HAND OF THE CREATOR IN THE FOUNDING OF OUR NATION . WE WILL FIGHT TO KEEP THE WORDS 'UNDER GOD ' IN THE PLEDGE OF ALLEGIANCE . HAVE YOU SEEN THE NEW DOLLAR COIN ? 'IN GOD WE TRUST ' HAS BEEN MOVED . IT'S NOT ON THE FACE OF THE COIN ANYMORE , IT'S ON THE EDGE . VIRTUALLY INVISIBLE , JUST LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD WANTS HIM TO BE . I WILL GO TO WORK TO GET GOD BACK ON THE FRONT OF OUR COIN ! I WILL FIGHT TO MAKE SURE OUR FUTURE IS NOT DEFINED BY THE LETTERS 'ACLU ,' BUT BY THE LETTERS 'USA .' REPUBLICANS FOR CHANGE ARE PATRIOTIC . WE LOVE THE FLAG . WE SAY THE PLEDGE . WE TELL SOLDIERS IN THE AIRPORT , UNKNOWNWORD YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE , FOR YOUR SACRIFICE .' AND WHEN A REPUBLICAN SAYS 'WE SUPPORT OUR TROOPS ,' IT COMES FROM THE HEART . HAVE YOU NOTICED WHAT HAPPENS AT THE OLYMPICS WHEN SOMEONE WINS THE GOLD MEDAL ? ATHLETES FROM OTHER COUNTRIES ASCEND THE MEDAL STAND , AND THEY HIGH-FIVE AND CELEBRATE WHILE THEIR COUNTRY'S ANTHEM IS PLAYED . BUT AMERICANS PLACE THEIR HAND ON THEIR HEART AND THEY SING THE WORDS TO THE STAR UNKNOWNWORD BANNER . I DON'T KNOW WHERE OUR TRADITION OF PLACING OUR HAND OVER OUR HEART DURING THE NATIONAL ANTHEM CAME FROM . I IMAGINE THAT IT IS A SIGN OF LOVE . FOR OUR FLAG , FOR AMERICA , FOR FREEDOM . AND IT IS SOMETHING MORE . OUR HAND COVERS OUR HEART TO SHOW OUR APPRECIATION FOR THE PATRIOTS WHO HAVE SHED THEIR BLOOD FOR OUR FREEDOM . 'O BEAUTIFUL FOR HEROES PROVED IN LIBERATING STRIFE , WHO MORE THAN SELF THEIR COUNTRY LOVED AND MERCY MORE THAN LIFE .' AMERICAN PATRIOTISM IS WHY I AM CONVINCED THIS NATION WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL AS THE GREATEST HOPE OF THE EARTH . AMERICA FACES UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES , A VIRTUAL PERFECT STORM UNKNOWNWORD THE PILLARS OF OUR STRENGTH . THE COURSE OF OUR HISTORY WILL CHANGE . AND FOR AMERICA TO REMAIN THE GREAT NATION IT HAS ALWAYS BEEN , IT WILL LOOK TO REPUBLICANS FOR LEADERSHIP . AT THE BEGINNING OF MY REMARKS , I TOLD YOU ABOUT THAT SPEECH MY DAD GAVE A UNKNOWNWORD AGO . IN IT , HE QUOTED RALPH WALDO UNKNOWNWORD , ONE OF THE GREAT AMERICAN PHILOSOPHERS , WHO SAID , 'THERE IS NO WEAKNESS EXCEPT FROM WITHIN , AND THE ONLY UNSURMOUNTABLE UNKNOWNWORD IS OUR OWN INHERENT WEAKNESS OF PURPOSE .' THAT WAS TRUE THEN , AND IT'S TRUE NOW . IT'S WHY CHANGE MUST BEGIN WITH US . NOW IS THE TIME , THIS IS THE PLACE , FOR REPUBLICANS TO STAND TOGETHER . TO STAND FOR REPUBLICAN PRINCIPLES . NOW IS THE TIME , THIS IS THE PLACE , FOR THE CAMPAIGN OF CHANGE TO MOVE BOLDLY FORWARD . NOW IS THE TIME , THIS IS THE PLACE FOR REPUBLICANS TO LEAD AMERICA IN STRENGTH , IN FAITH , IN FAMILY , IN WHAT IS RIGHT . FOR RIGHT WILL ALWAYS PREVAIL . THANK YOU , AND GOD BLESS YOU .
RED	WE'VE JUST COME FROM CELEBRATING THE 4TH OF JULY . FOR ME , IT WAS PARADES IN IOWA AND FIREWORKS IN IDAHO . YOU KNOW , THE KIND OF CELEBRATING THE DEMOCRATS USUALLY RESERVE FOR APRIL UNKNOWNWORD . BUT THIS WEEK , WE WERE CELEBRATING OUR NATION'S BIRTHDAY . JULY 4 , UNKNOWNWORD WAS AN INFLECTION POINT IN HISTORY - A MOMENT THAT SET A NEW COURSE FOR AMERICA . TODAY , WE FACE WHAT IS SURE TO BE ANOTHER INFLECTION POINT IN AMERICAN HISTORY . A NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES , UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES , MEANS THAT WE MUST CHANGE OUR PRESENT COURSE . DOMESTICALLY , OUR ADDICTION TO SPENDING AND BORROWING IS BREACHING CRISIS PROPORTION . COMPETITIVELY , OUR CITIZENS CHOOSE TO BUY HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS MORE FROM FOREIGN NATIONS THAN THEY BUY FROM US . AND MILITARILY , WE FACE AN ENTIRELY NEW TYPE OF THREAT - VIOLENT JIHAD WHOSE SPONSORS SEEK NUCLEAR WEAPONS . TO CONFRONT UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGES , WE MUST CHANGE . BOTH PARTIES CLAIM TO BE THE PARTY OF CHANGE , AND I THINK BOTH ARE RIGHT . BUT THERE'S A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE DIRECTION THEIR CHANGE WOULD TAKE US . REPUBLICANS LOOK TO OUR AMERICAN HERITAGE . THE 4TH OF JULY MARKED OUR INDEPENDENCE FROM ENGLAND . BUT THERE WAS MORE TO IT THAN THAT . THE FOUNDING FATHERS ESTABLISHED A NATION WHERE THE PEOPLE WERE SOVEREIGN , NOT THE STATE , NOT THE KING . WE WOULD NOT RELY ON THE DIVINE RIGHT OF KINGS , OR THEIR WHIMSICAL BENEFICENCE . WE WOULD RELY ON OURSELVES . SUCCEED OR FAIL , AMERICA WOULD BE THE LAND OF OPPORTUNITY . SO WHEN REPUBLICANS TALK OF CHANGE , WE ARE TALKING ABOUT OPPORTUNITY AND FREEDOM . WE ARE TALKING ABOUT PEOPLE , NOT GOVERNMENT . DEMOCRATS LOOK BEYOND OUR HERITAGE - THEY LOOK TO THE EUROPE OF THE PAST . WHEN DEMOCRATS TALK OF CHANGE , THEY ARE THINKING ABOUT BIG GOVERNMENT , BIG WELFARE , BIG TAXES AND BIG BROTHER . BUT THOSE ARE THE VERY POLICIES THAT LED TO EUROPE'S DECLINE . IN SHORT , BIG MISTAKE . LOOK AT HOW DEMOCRATS LIKE SENATOR CLINTON THINK ABOUT THE ECONOMY . SHE SAID THAT IT IS 'TIME TO REJECT THE IDEA OF AN ON YOUR OWN SOCIETY AND REPLACE IT WITH SHARED RESPONSIBILITY .' SHE SAYS SHE PREFERS A UNKNOWNWORD ALL IN IT TOGETHER SOCIETY .' I SEE , OUT WITH ADAM SMITH AND IN WITH KARL MARX ! DON'T DEMOCRATS SEE THAT INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE IS AT THE HEART OF AMERICA'S UNPRECEDENTED MARCH TO WORLD ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP ? ADAM SMITH WASN'T HEARTLESS . ADAM SMITH SAW THAT INDIVIDUAL INITIATIVE WOULD PRODUCE THE GREATEST WEALTH FOR THE ENTIRE SOCIETY . CAN'T DEMOCRATS SEE THAT SINCE THE 1970'S WHILE EUROPE'S GROWTH STAGNATED , AMERICA CREATED UNKNOWNWORD MILLION NEW JOBS ? LOOK AT UNEMPLOYMENT , LOOK AT GROWTH - AMERICA WON , EUROPE LOST . THAT'S WHY EUROPEANS ARE BEGINNING TO ELECT CONSERVATIVES . COME TO THINK OF IT , WITH HER ECONOMIC PLAN , HILLARY CLINTON COULDN'T BE ELECTED PRESIDENT OF FRANCE ! SENATOR CLINTON'S ECONOMIC PLAN GOES BEYOND UTOPIAN VISIONS OF COLLECTIVE GOOD . SHE ALSO HAS A SPECIAL PROGRAM FOR CORPORATE TAXES : SHE WANTS TO RAISE THEM . IT'S TIME , SHE SAYS , TO REQUIRE CORPORATIONS 'TO PAY THEIR FAIR SHARE .' THE LAST TIME I CHECKED , AMERICAN CORPORATIONS WERE SUBJECT TO THE SECOND HIGHEST TAX RATES IN THE INDUSTRIALIZED WORLD , JUST A UNKNOWNWORD BELOW JAPAN . IN OUR NEW 'FLAT ' WORLD ECONOMY , MANY CORPORATIONS CAN MOVE THEIR HEADQUARTERS AND THEIR OPERATIONS ALMOST AT WILL . JUST LOOK AT THE ECONOMIC BOOM PRODUCED BY IRELAND'S MOVE TO LOWER CORPORATE TAXES . LET'S NOT RAISE TAXES ON THE EMPLOYERS WHO CREATE JOBS AND NATIONAL WEALTH , LET'S LOWER THEM ! CORPORATE TAXES AREN'T THE END OF IT . DEMOCRATS HAVE THEIR SIGHTS ON 2011 FOR A RECORD-BREAKING PERSONAL INCOME TAX HIKE . AND WHENEVER YOU TAKE MONEY AWAY FROM CITIZENS , AND GIVE THEIR MONEY TO GOVERNMENT , YOU SLOW DOWN THE ECONOMY . WHEN DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT CHANGE , THEY'RE REFERRING TO WHAT YOU'D HAVE LEFT IN YOUR POCKETS . I HAVE A DIFFERENT ANSWER . LET'S MAKE THE BUSH TAX CUTS PERMANENT . LET'S KILL THE DEATH TAX . AND LET'S HAVE A NEW TAX RATE FOR MIDDLE INCOME AMERICANS WHO WANT TO SAVE THEIR MONEY , WHO ARE INVESTING IN AMERICA . THE TAX RATE ON THEIR INTEREST , DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS SHOULD BE...EXACTLY ZERO ! OUR FISCAL PROBLEM IS NOT THAT WE ARE TAXING TOO LITTLE ; IT IS THAT WASHINGTON IS SPENDING TOO MUCH . SHAME ON BOTH PARTIES IN CONGRESS FOR ALL THE EARMARKS , THE WASTE , THE DUPLICATION , AND THE FAILURE TO REFORM ENTITLEMENTS . I AM PROUD TO BE THE FIRST PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATE TO HAVE SIGNED GROVER NORQUIST'S TAX PLEDGE . BUT I HAVE MADE ANOTHER PLEDGE AS WELL . IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WILL CAP NON-DEFENSE DISCRETIONARY SPENDING AT INFLATION MINUS ONE PERCENT . THAT ALONE WILL SAVE $300 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS . IF CONGRESS SENDS ME APPROPRIATIONS THAT EXCEED THAT CAP , I WILL VETO THEM . I DON'T CARE IF IT'S A REPUBLICAN OR A DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS . I WILL VETO . AND I KNOW HOW TO VETO . I LIKE VETOES . I VETOED HUNDREDS OF SPENDING APPROPRIATIONS AS GOVERNOR . AND BY THE WAY , IF CONGRESS DOESN'T WANT TO DO THE CUTTING ITSELF , THEN GIVE ME THE LINE-ITEM VETO . OF COURSE , I WILL DO MORE THAN VETO . I WILL PERSONALLY LEAD A TOP-TO-BOTTOM REVIEW OF GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS , AGENCIES , PROCUREMENT AND SPENDING . IT'S TIME TO CUT OUT THE MOUNTAINS OF WASTE AND UNKNOWNWORD AND DUPLICATION FROM THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . ONLY IN WASHINGTON WOULD SOMEONE THINK THAT 342 DIFFERENT ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT PROGRAMS MAKE SENSE . CUTTING WASTE , UNKNOWNWORD , BENCHMARKING - THIS IS WHAT I DO . I HAVE DONE IT IN BUSINESS , I'VE DONE IT IN THE OLYMPICS , AND I'VE DONE IT IN STATE GOVERNMENT . I SIMPLY CAN'T WAIT TO GET MY HANDS ON WASHINGTON ! FUNNY THING , DEMOCRATS TALK ABOUT RAISING TAXES ON PEOPLE . WE TALK ABOUT CUTTING SPENDING BY GOVERNMENT . FOR THEM , IT'S ALWAYS GOVERNMENT FIRST , PEOPLE LAST . HERE'S AN INCONVENIENT TRUTH AL GORE WON'T TELL YOU ABOUT . ONE THING YOU CAN COUNT ON IF AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IS HIGHER TAXES . TIME AND AGAIN WHEN HILLARY AND THE DEMOCRATS SEE A PROBLEM , THEY THINK GOVERNMENT FIRST . THERE ARE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE . THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR THOSE PEOPLE , AND IT'S NOT GOOD FOR EVERYONE ELSE EITHER . WHEN PEOPLE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE GET SICK , THEY GO TO THE HOSPITAL AND GET FREE CARE . FREE FOR THEM , THAT IS , BUT EXPENSIVE FOR YOU BECAUSE YOU ARE THE ONES THAT PAY THEIR BILLS , EITHER IN YOUR TAXES OR IN YOUR INSURANCE PREMIUMS . THE DEMOCRATS ' SOLUTION ? UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSAL HEALTHCARE . BUT THE LAST THING AMERICA NEEDS IS SOCIALIZED MEDICINE - HILLARY-CARE ! AT LEAST BARACK OBAMA HAD THE COURAGE TO ADMIT THAT HIS PLAN MEANS HIGHER TAXES . IT'S JUST LIKE P.J . UNKNOWNWORD SAID : UNKNOWNWORD YOU THINK HEALTHCARE IS EXPENSIVE NOW , WAIT TILL IT'S FREE !' THE RIGHT ANSWER FOR HEALTHCARE ISN'T GOVERNMENT , AND THE NEW SECRETARY OF HEALTH AND HUMAN SERVICES SHOULD NOT BE MICHAEL MOORE . LET'S PROVIDE PEOPLE WITH THEIR OWN PRIVATE , AFFORDABLE AND PORTABLE INSURANCE BY INSISTING ON PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY AND THE PRINCIPLES OF THE FREE MARKET . LET'S NOT HAVE THE SAME BUREAUCRACY THAT RAN THE KATRINA CLEAN-UP MANAGE OUR HEALTHCARE ! THE DEMOCRATS HAVE A PLAN FOR ILLEGAL IMMIGRATION AS WELL . IT'S AMNESTY . HILLARY CLINTON , BARACK OBAMA AND THEIR COLLEAGUES INSIST THAT EVERY ILLEGAL IMMIGRANT BECOME A LEGAL PERMANENT RESIDENT OF THIS COUNTRY . SOME PEOPLE THINK THAT THEIR POSITION HAS LESS TO DO WITH COMPASSION THAN WITH CALCULATION - THEY HOPE THESE ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS WILL VOTE THEM IN POWER FOREVER . BUT THIS IS NOT ABOUT POWER OR POLITICS . IT IS ABOUT SOVEREIGNTY AND SECURITY . AND IT IS ABOUT FAIRNESS . MILLIONS OF APPLICANTS ARE WAITING TO COME HERE LEGALLY , TO BE JOINED WITH FAMILY MEMBERS , TO BRING EDUCATION AND SKILL THAT WILL STRENGTHEN OUR NATION , NOT BURDEN IT . LEGAL IMMIGRATION IS A BOON TO OUR NATION . WE ARE MADE A GREATER NATION WHEN IMMIGRANTS COME HERE LEGALLY , SEEKING OPPORTUNITY . LET'S SECURE THE BORDER , INSTALL AN EMPLOYMENT VERIFICATION SYSTEM AND TELL ILLEGAL IMMIGRANTS TO GET IN LINE WITH EVERYONE ELSE . THERE SHOULD BE NO SPECIAL PATHWAY TO PERMANENT RESIDENCY OR CITIZENSHIP FOR THOSE WHO HAVE COME HERE ILLEGALLY ! AMNESTY DIDN'T WORK BEFORE AND IT WON'T WORK NOW ! BEYOND OUR DOMESTIC CHALLENGES , WE FACE A VERY DIFFERENT WORLD AROUND US . ASIA IS EMERGING FROM GENERATIONS OF POVERTY . IT'S BECOMING A FAR MORE EFFECTIVE COMPETITOR IN THE MARKETPLACE THAN WE HAVE EVER FACED BEFORE . IN THE PAST , WE'VE COMPETED UNKNOWNWORD WITH EUROPE . WE KNOW HOW TO COMPETE WITH EUROPEANS - THEY ARE A LOT LIKE US . THEY LIKE SHORT WORK WEEKS AND LONG VACATIONS . BUT CHINA AND INDIA ARE VERY DIFFERENT . THEIR WORKFORCE IS ALMOST NEVER-ENDING ; AND IT IS VERY HARD-WORKING . AMERICANS ARE BUYING HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS MORE FROM THEM THAN THEY DO FROM US . THE DEMOCRATS SEE THIS CHALLENGE AND SHRINK FROM IT . THEY DON'T THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE CAN COMPETE . THEY WANT TO PULL UP THE UNKNOWNWORD TO PROTECT US . THEY'RE SO PESSIMISTIC ABOUT AMERICANS THAT THEY HAVE BEEN TRYING TO SCUTTLE FREE TRADE AGREEMENTS WITH NATIONS IN LATIN AMERICA AND CENTRAL AMERICA . ARE THEY KIDDING ? WE CAN'T COMPETE WITH COLOMBIA ? OUR ONLY CHOICE IS TO COMPETE . FAIL TO COMPETE AND YOU END UP WITH A SOVIET-STYLE ECONOMY - UNKNOWNWORD PRODUCTS , ANEMIC STANDARDS OF LIVING AND ECONOMIC COLLAPSE . THE ANSWER FOR AMERICA IS NOT TO RETREAT , IT IS TO LOWER THE RAMPS AND CHARGE INTO THE EMERGING ASIAN MARKETPLACE . INVEST IN OUR PEOPLE . INVEST IN TECHNOLOGY . DEMOCRATS FEAR THE STRENGTH OF OTHERS , REPUBLICANS BELIEVE IN THE STRENGTH OF AMERICANS ! THE NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES WE FACE TODAY INCLUDES CHALLENGES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AS WELL . VIOLENT JIHADISTS ARE INTENT ON REPLACING MODERATE MUSLIM GOVERNMENTS WITH A CALIPHATE OR UNKNOWNWORD . AND THEY SEEK THE COLLAPSE OF OUR ECONOMY , OUR GOVERNMENT , AND OUR MILITARY . DURING THIS LAST WEEK , THEY SOUGHT TO MAIM AND KILL INNOCENT CIVILIANS IN LONDON AND GLASGOW . THESE WERE NOT IMPOVERISHED MALCONTENTS ; THEY WERE DOCTORS SERVING IN BRITAIN'S PUBLIC HEALTH SYSTEM . THEY WERE JIHADISTS . THEIRS IS A FACE OF EVIL NOT SEEN IN THE CIVILIZED WORLD SINCE THE GAS UNKNOWNWORD OF HITLER'S HORROR . I KNOW THAT IT IS POPULAR TODAY TO BE CRITICAL OF THE PRESIDENT . AND HE IS NOT ABOVE MAKING MISTAKES . BUT WE SHOULD THANK HIM FOR DOING EVERYTHING IN HIS POWER TO KEEP US SAFE . AGAINST THE OBJECTIONS OF DEMOCRATS AND EVEN SOME IN OUR OWN PARTY , HE PUSHED THOUGH THE PATRIOT ACT . HE MADE SURE THAT SOMEONE WAS LISTENING IN WHEN AL QAEDA WAS CALLING . HE MADE SURE WE WERE INTERROGATING TERRORISTS TO LEARN HOW WE COULD PREVENT ATTACKS ON OUR CITIZENS . WHEN KHALID SHEIKH MOHAMMAD , THE MASTERMIND OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS , WAS CAPTURED , HE SAID , 'SEE YOU WITH MY LAWYER IN NEW YORK .' NOPE , THAT'S NOT AT ALL WHAT HE SAW : HE SAW THE CIA AND OUR GI'S AT GUANTANAMO ! ALL THIS TALK OF JIHADISTS , SALAFI MUSLIMS , AND THE WAR ON TERROR MAKES DEMOCRATS LIKE JOHN EDWARDS UNKNOWNWORD . SENATOR EDWARDS SAYS THERE ISN'T A WAR ON TERROR - IT'S ONLY A SLOGAN . TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE IN LONDON AND GLASGOW . AND TO THE PEOPLE IN BALI AND MALAYSIA , PAKISTAN AND LEBANON , TANZANIA AND KENYA , SAUDI ARABIA AND ISRAEL . TELL THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK AND BOSTON AND WASHINGTON , D.C . ONE THING YOU CAN COUNT ON IF I AM PRESIDENT , IF THERE IS A WAR BEING WAGED BY THE TERRORISTS , THERE WILL BE WAR WAGED ON THE TERRORISTS . AND WE WILL WIN ! THIS UNKNOWNWORD OF CHALLENGES IS WHY I AM CONVINCED THAT AMERICA IS AT AN INFLECTION POINT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR UNKNOWNWORD , OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL , THE EMERGENCE OF ASIA , THE JIHADIST THREAT TO WORLD CIVILIZATION . THESE CHALLENGES WILL FORCE US TO CHANGE . AND THAT CHANGE WILL EITHER MAKE US STRONGER OR IT WILL MAKE US WEAKER . AMERICA WILL EITHER REMAIN THE WORLD'S SUPERPOWER OR INSTEAD BECOME JUST ANOTHER MEMBER OF THE FAMILY OF NATIONS . IF WE CHOOSE STRENGTH , WE WILL BE REMEMBERED BY OUR CHILDREN AS A GREAT GENERATION . IF WE CHOOSE WEAKNESS , WE WILL BE REMEMBERED AS SOMETHING MUCH LESS . CONSERVATISM , UNKNOWNWORD , IS A PHILOSOPHY OF STRENGTH . WE BELIEVE IN A STRONG MILITARY , A STRONG ECONOMY , AND IN STRONG FAMILIES AND VALUES . WE BELIEVE IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT IS THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH . THEY'RE WRONG . I LOVE WHAT RONALD REAGAN SAID : 'IT'S NOT THAT LIBERALS ARE IGNORANT , IT'S JUST THAT WHAT THEY KNOW IS WRONG !' THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH - HARD WORKING , EDUCATED , RISK TAKING , OPPORTUNITY LOVING , GOD FEARING , WILLING TO SACRIFICE FOR THEIR FAMILY AND THEIR COUNTRY , FREEDOM LOVING AMERICAN PEOPLE . THEY HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE ! AND WHEN YOU NEED TO CALL ON THE STRENGTH OF AMERICA , YOU DON'T STRENGTHEN GOVERNMENT , YOU STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . YOU STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY LETTING THEM KEEP MORE OF THEIR OWN MONEY , NOT BY TAXING THEM MORE WHEN THEY EARN , TAXING THEM WHEN THEY SAVE AND TAXING THEM WHEN THEY DIE ! YOU STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY MAKING SURE THAT THE VOICE OF MILLIONS OF VOTERS TRUMPS THE VOICE OF A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNELECTED JUDGES . YOU STRENGTHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH THE WORLD'S BEST HEALTHCARE , THE WORLD'S BEST SCHOOLS , AND THE WORLD'S STRONGEST FAMILIES . WE MUST PRESERVE THE INSTITUTION OF MARRIAGE - EVERY CHILD DESERVES A MOTHER AND A FATHER ! THIS IS NOT A TIME FOR OUR PARTY TO SHRINK FROM CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES . IT IS A TIME TO HOLD THEM UNKNOWNWORD . WE DIDN'T SUFFER LOSSES LAST YEAR BECAUSE WE WERE CONSERVATIVE . WE SUFFERED LOSSES BECAUSE WE STRAYED FROM CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES . TOO MUCH SPENDING , TOO LITTLE ETHICS AND A WAR THAT EVERYONE RECOGNIZES WAS NOT EFFECTIVELY MANAGED . THE WAY FORWARD IS NOT TO LOOK LEFT . THE WAY FORWARD IS TO LOOK AHEAD . THERE IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE TO DO OTHERWISE . UNKNOWNWORD PERES , THE PRESIDENT-ELECT OF ISRAEL , VISITED BOSTON NOT TOO LONG AGO . HE WAS ASKED WHAT HE THOUGHT ABOUT THE CONFLICT IN IRAQ . 'FIRST ,' HE SAID , 'I MUST PUT THAT IN CONTEXT . AMERICA IS UNIQUE . IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD , WHENEVER THERE'S BEEN WAR , THE NATION THAT WINS TAKES LAND FROM THE NATION THAT LOSES . THAT IS BECAUSE LAND HAS BEEN THE SOURCE OF VALUE IN THE WORLD . ONE NATION IN HISTORY , AND THIS DURING THE LAST CENTURY , LAID DOWN HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF LIVES AND TOOK NO LAND . NO LAND FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD , NO LAND FROM THE JAPANESE .' THE ONLY LAND AMERICA TAKES IS ENOUGH LAND TO BURY HER DEAD . AMERICA FIGHTS FOR FREEDOM - FOR ITSELF AND FOR FREEDOM-LOVING PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD . THIS IS THE AMERICA OUR PARENTS CHOSE , A NATION THAT IS GOOD , A NATION THAT IS STRONG . AND NOW IT IS TIME FOR US TO CHOOSE WHAT AMERICA WILL BE . I KNOW WHAT I CHOOSE . I KNOW WHAT YOU CHOOSE . WE CHOOSE A STRONG AMERICA THAT WILL ALWAYS BE THE LAND OF THE FREE , THE HOME OF THE BRAVE AND THE HOPE OF THE WORLD .
RED	THANK YOU CAROL . WE APPRECIATE YOUR MANY YEARS OF DEDICATED SERVICE TO THE CAUSE OF LIFE . I WAS HONORED TO ACCEPT YOUR INVITATION TO ADDRESS THE NATIONAL RIGHT TO LIFE CONVENTION . I AM HUMBLED TO BE STANDING AMONG THE MANY WHO HAVE TOILED FOR THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT FOR SO LONG , WHEN I ARRIVED AT THIS PLACE OF PRINCIPLE ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO . I APPRECIATE THE DECADES OF DEDICATION AND THE EFFECTIVE ADVOCACY OF PEOPLE LIKE JIM UNKNOWNWORD , THE SPECIAL ADVISER TO MY CAMPAIGN ON LIFE ISSUES . I KNOW THAT IT IS NOT TIME BUT CONVICTION THAT UNITES US . I PROUDLY FOLLOW A LONG LINE OF CONVERTS . GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH , HENRY HYDE , AND RONALD REAGAN TO NAME A FEW I AM EVIDENCE THAT YOUR WORK , THAT YOUR RELENTLESS CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE , BEARS FRUIT . CONSIDER THE DOUBLE STANDARD AT WORK HERE , BY THE WAY . WHEN A PRO-LIFE FIGURE CHANGES TO PRO-ABORTION , THEY GET UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEIR COURAGE . BUT WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES PRO-LIFE , THE PUNDITS GO INTO HIGH DUDGEON . AND SO , I AM HUMBLED BUT ALSO GRATEFUL TO BE WELCOMED SO WARMLY BY SO MANY WITH WHOM I SHARE A COMMON DEDICATION . ANYONE HERE FROM THE PRO-LIFE COMMUNITY IN MASSACHUSETTS KNOWS THEY WERE ALWAYS WELCOME IN MY OFFICE WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR . TOGETHER WE WORKED ARM IN ARM . I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS . YOU WILL BE WELCOMED , AND WE WILL WORK TOGETHER , IF I'M FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT . PEOPLE OFTEN ASK ME HOW A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN SUCH AS MYSELF COULD HAVE BEEN ELECTED IN MASSACHUSETTS . I TELL THEM THAT THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT HELPED ACCOUNT FOR MY IMPROBABLE VICTORY . FIRST , THE STATE WAS IN A FISCAL CRISIS . A MELTDOWN , OF SORTS . STATE GOVERNMENT COULDN'T GET BUDGETS DONE ON TIME . ANOTHER BIG TAX HIKE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ON THE WAY . I PROMISED TO BALANCE THE BUDGET WITHOUT RAISING TAXES . AND TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE , THAT'S WHAT WE DID . WE ELIMINATED A $3 BILLION SHORTFALL . AND BY THE TIME I LEFT , MY SURPLUSES HAD REPLENISHED THE RAINY-DAY FUND TO OVER $2 BILLION . SECOND , WE WERE IN AN ECONOMIC CRISIS . MASSACHUSETTS WAS LOSING JOBS EVERY MONTH AND OUR CITIZENS WERE AFRAID OF LOSING MORE . I WENT TO WORK TO BRING EMPLOYERS BACK TO OUR STATE . BY THE END OF THE RECESSION , WE ADDED 60,000 NEW JOBS . WE GOT OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACT TOGETHER . WHICH EXPLAINS MUCH OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT THE COMMONWEALTH CONTINUES TO EXPERIENCE EVEN TODAY . AND THIRD , WE WERE IN THE BEGINNINGS OF A CULTURAL CRISIS . SOCIAL VALUES ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN MY CAMPAIGN SUCCESS . MY OPPONENT SAID SHE WOULD SIGN A BILL THAT WOULD SANCTION SAME SEX MARRIAGE . I SAID THAT I WOULD OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE AND CIVIL UNIONS . MY OPPONENT FAVORED BILINGUAL EDUCATION . I DID NOT . I SAID THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AMERICA , CHILDREN NEED TO SPEAK THE LANGUAGE OF AMERICA . AND MY OPPONENT WANTED TO LOWER THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR AN ABORTION FROM 18 TO 16 . AND I DID NOT . AND SO , SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES , MANY OF THEM DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS , JOINED FISCAL CONSERVATIVES TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN . THAT BEING SAID , I HAD NO INKLING THAT I WOULD FIND MYSELF IN THE CENTER OF THE BATTLEFIELD ON VIRTUALLY EVERY MAJOR SOCIAL QUESTION OF OUR TIME . THE FIRST BATTLE CAME WHEN THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT , BY A ONE VOTE MAJORITY , FOUND A RIGHT TO SAME SEX MARRIAGE IN OUR CONSTITUTION . JOHN ADAMS WROTE THAT CONSTITUTION . I'M SURE HE'D BE SURPRISED . THE COURT SAID THAT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE . THE NATURAL UNION OF ONE MAN AND ONE WOMAN . 'IS ROOTED IN PERSISTENT PREJUDICES ' AND 'WORKS A DEEP AND SCARRING HARDSHIP ... FOR NO RATIONAL REASON .' NO RATIONAL REASON ? HOW ABOUT CHILDREN ? ISN'T IT CLEAR THAT MARRIAGE PROVIDES THE BEST ENVIRONMENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT AND NURTURING OF CHILDREN ? AND ISN'T A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT ENHANCED BY HAVING BOTH A MOTHER AND A FATHER ? I BELIEVE THAT THE COURT GOT IT WRONG BECAUSE IT FOCUSED ON THE UNKNOWNWORD AND PERCEIVED RIGHTS OF ADULTS . THE COURT SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON THE NEEDS OF CHILDREN . THE IDEAL SETTING FOR THE RAISING OF A CHILD IS A HOME BUILT ON A MARRIAGE BETWEEN A LOVING MOTHER AND FATHER . THEN CAME THE 'SLIPPERY SLOPE ' . NOT THE ARGUMENT BUT THE REALITY . THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE MARRIAGE DECISION QUICKLY WENT WELL BEYOND ADULT MARRIAGE . EFFORTS WERE MADE TO CHANGE BIRTH CERTIFICATES BY REMOVING 'MOTHER ' AND 'FATHER ' AND REPLACING THEM WITH 'PARENT A ' AND 'PARENT B .' I SAID NO TO THAT . AND PARENTS OF A CHILD IN SECOND GRADE WERE TOLD THAT THEIR SON IS REQUIRED TO LISTEN TO THE READING OF A BOOK CALLED THE 'KING AND THE KING ,' ABOUT A PRINCE WHO MARRIES ANOTHER PRINCE . THE SCHOOL'S RATIONALE WAS SINCE SAME SEX MARRIAGE WAS LEGAL , THE EDUCATION SYSTEM SHOULD ADVANCE THE IDEA . AND THEN ANOTHER SLIDE ALONG THE SLIPPERY SLOPE . THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS FORCED TO END ITS ADOPTION SERVICE , WHICH WAS CRUCIAL IN HELPING THE STATE FIND HOMES FOR SOME OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT TO PLACE CHILDREN . WHY ? BECAUSE THE CHURCH FAVORS PLACEMENTS IN HOMES WITH A MOTHER AND A FATHER . NOW , EVEN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WAS BEING TRUMPED BY THE NEW-FOUND 'RIGHT ' OF GAY MARRIAGE . I IMMEDIATELY DRAFTED AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO GRANT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTION , BUT THE LEGISLATURE WOULDN'T EVEN TAKE IT UP . WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR , WE TOOK EVERY UNKNOWNWORD STEP WITHIN THE LAW TO STOP , BLOCK OR SLOW DOWN THIS UNPRECEDENTED COURT DECISION . OUR GOAL WAS TO TAKE THE DECISION AWAY FROM THE COURT AND GIVE IT BACK TO THE PEOPLE . BUT YESTERDAY , THE MASSACHUSETTS STATE LEGISLATURE , AT THE URGING OF THE NEW DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR , REFUSED TO ALLOW THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE TO BE HEARD . THE FIGHT IS NOT OVER . WE NEED TO TAKE THIS BATTLE TO WASHINGTON AGAIN . WE NEED TO EXPLAIN THE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS OF THE PUSH TO DRAMATICALLY CHANGE OUR MARRIAGE LAWS . NOW IS THE TIME TO PASS A FEDERAL MARRIAGE AMENDMENT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE IN ALL 50 STATES . IN THE MIDST OF THAT BATTLE , ANOTHER AROSE . IT INVOLVED CLONING AND EMBRYO FARMING FOR PURPOSES OF RESEARCH . I STUDIED THE SUBJECT IN GREAT DEPTH . I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH . BUT FOR ME , A BRIGHT MORAL LINE IS CROSSED WHEN WE CREATE NEW LIFE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXPERIMENTATION AND DESTRUCTION . THAT'S WHY I FOUGHT TO KEEP CLONING AND EMBRYO FARMING ILLEGAL . IT WAS DURING THIS BATTLE THAT I BEGAN TO FOCUS A GOOD DEAL MORE OF MY THINKING ON ABORTION . WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE , WHILE I WAS ALWAYS PERSONALLY OPPOSED TO ABORTION , I CONSIDERED WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE A PRIVATE DECISION OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE A SOCIETAL AND GOVERNMENT DECISION . I CONCLUDED THAT I WOULD SUPPORT THE LAW AS IT WAS IN PLACE . EFFECTIVELY , THE PRO-CHOICE POSITION . AND I WAS WRONG . WHAT BECAME CLEAR DURING THE CLONING DEBATE IS HOW THE HARSH LOGIC OF AN ABSOLUTE RIGHT TO ABORTION HAD CHEAPENED THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE TO THE POINT THAT RATIONAL PEOPLE SAW A HUMAN EMBRYO AS NOTHING MORE THAN MERE RESEARCH MATERIAL TO BE USED , AND THEN DESTROYED . THE SLIPPERY SLOPE WAS TAKING US TO RACKS AND RACKS OF LIVING HUMAN EMBRYOS , BRAVE NEW WORLD-LIKE , AWAITING TERMINATION . WHAT SOME SEE AS JUST A CLUMP OF CELLS IS ACTUALLY A HUMAN LIFE . HUMAN LIFE HAS IDENTITY . HUMAN LIFE HAS THE CAPACITY TO LOVE AND BE LOVED . HUMAN LIFE HAS A PROFOUND DIGNITY , UNDIMINISHED BY AGE OR INFIRMITY . MY EXPERIENCE AS GOVERNOR TAUGHT ME FIRSTHAND THAT THE THREAT TO OUR CULTURE IS REAL AND THOSE IN A POSITION TO DO SO MUST TAKE ACTION TO DEFEND IT . TIMES OF DECISION ARE MOMENTS OF GREAT CLARITY . BEFORE I WAS GOVERNOR , THE LIFE ISSUE WAS JUST THAT , AN ISSUE . BUT WHEN RESPONSIBILITY FOR LIFE OR ENDING LIFE WAS PLACED IN MY HANDS , I MADE THE RIGHT DECISION . I CHOSE LIFE . JUST LIKE SOME OTHERS IN THE PRO-LIFE MOVEMENT , A MOMENT OF DECISION BECAME A DEFINING MOMENT . AND SO , EVERY TIME I FACED A DECISION AS GOVERNOR THAT RELATED TO LIFE , I CAME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF LIFE . I FOUGHT TO BAN CLONING . I FOUGHT TO BAN EMBRYO FARMING . I FOUGHT TO DEFINE LIFE AS BEGINNING AT CONCEPTION RATHER THAN AT THE TIME OF IMPLANTATION . I FOUGHT FOR ABSTINENCE EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS . AND I VETOED A SO-CALLED EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION BILL THAT GAVE YOUNG GIRLS ABORTIVE DRUGS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION OR PARENTAL CONSENT . THAT IS MY RECORD AS GOVERNOR OF MASSACHUSETTS . RECENTLY , I WAS ATTACKED BY ONE OF MY OPPONENTS BECAUSE WHEN I RAN FOR GOVERNOR I PROMISED TO MAINTAIN THE STATUS QUO WITH REGARDS TO LAWS RELATING TO ABORTION IN MASSACHUSETTS . OF COURSE , I KEPT THAT PROMISE . BUT IN MASSACHUSETTS , THAT MEANT VETOING PRO-CHOICE LEGISLATION . AS I CONSISTENTLY DID AS GOVERNOR . THAT'S WHY LAST MONTH I WAS HONORED WITH AN AWARD FROM MASSACHUSETTS CITIZENS FOR LIFE IN RECOGNITION OF THE ACTIONS I TOOK AS GOVERNOR TO PROTECT LIFE . THE NEXT PRESIDENT , ESPECIALLY IF FACED WITH A HOSTILE CONGRESS , WILL BE CONFRONTED WITH MANY UNKNOWNWORD TESTS , SUCH AS CHALLENGING THE HYDE AMENDMENT AND ADVANCING CLONING . YOU CAN BE SURE THAT I WILL BE BRINGING MY GUBERNATORIAL EXPERIENCE . AND MY VETO PEN . WITH ME TO WASHINGTON . THE LARGER PROBLEM IS THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR PRO-CHOICE VIEWS MUST BE IMPOSED ON EVERYONE . MORE AND MORE , THE VEHICLE FOR THIS IMPOSITION IS THE COURTS . SOME SAY THAT IT IS 'OK ' FOR THE COURTS TO IMPOSE THEIR PERSONAL PUBLIC POLICY PREFERENCES ON SOCIETY . I AM NOT AMONG THEM . MAKE NO MISTAKE : THE UNKNOWNWORD RIGHTS OF ABORTION-ON-DEMAND AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE ARE NOT IN THE CONSTITUTION . BUT THE PROBLEM OF AN ACTIVIST BENCH GOES BEYOND THE ISSUE OF ABORTION AND GAY MARRIAGE THAT . SLOWLY BUT SURELY , THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO BE THE FINAL ARBITERS OF OUR LIVES . THEY HAVE FORGOTTEN THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF DEMOCRACY IS THE RIGHT TO GOVERN OURSELVES . CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS PUT IT BEST AT HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING , WHEN HE DESCRIBED THE ROLE OF A JUDGE . 'JUDGES AND JUSTICES ARE SERVANTS OF THE LAW ,' HE SAID , 'NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND . JUDGES ARE LIKE UMPIRES . UMPIRES DON'T MAKE THE RULES , THEY APPLY THEM ... AND I WILL REMEMBER THAT IT'S MY JOB TO CALL BALLS AND STRIKES AND NOT TO PITCH OR BAT .' NOW THAT'S THE TYPE OF JUSTICE THAT I WOULD APPOINT TO THE COURT . ON THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V . WADE , RONALD REAGAN OBSERVED THAT THE COURT'S DECISION HAD NOT YET SETTLED THE ABORTION DEBATE . IT HAD BECOME 'A CONTINUING PROD TO THE CONSCIENCE OF THE NATION .' MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS LATER , THAT IS STILL THE CASE . NUMEROUS COURT DECISIONS HAVE NOT SETTLED THIS QUESTION , BUT HAVE FURTHER DIVIDED THE NATION . AND ROE V . WADE CONTINUES TO WORK ITS DESTRUCTIVE LOGIC THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY . THIS CANNOT CONTINUE . AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE DECIDED BY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES . I CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN TREATING ALL PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND DIGNITY . YOU CAN'T BE A PRO-LIFE GOVERNOR IN THE BLUEST OF BLUE STATES WITHOUT UNDERSTANDING THAT THERE ARE HEARTFELT AND THOUGHTFUL ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION . IT IS OUR GREAT TASK TO PERSUADE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS OF THE TRUTH OF OUR CONVICTIONS . STRENGTHENING OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FAMILIES , PROTECTING MARRIAGE AND HUMAN LIFE AND PRESERVING FOR OUR CHILDREN THE TRUE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY ; THESE ARE NOBLE PURPOSES . I AM CONFIDENT WE ARE WORTHY OF THEM . AFTER ALL , WE ARE A DECENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THE WORTH AND DIGNITY OF EVERY PERSON . THIS IS INGRAINED IN OUR HEARTS AND ETCHED IN OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE . THANK YOU .
RED	IT'S A HONOR TO BE WITH YOU AND BE WITH PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE PRO-LIFE VALUES THROUGHOUT THEIR LIVES . I BELIEVE IT'S AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS AWARD , AS YOU CAN IMAGINE . I RECOGNIZE THAT IT IS UNKNOWNWORD FOR WHERE I AM ON THE ISSUE OF LIFE , NOT FOR WHERE I'VE BEEN . AND I RESPECT THE FACT THAT YOU ARRIVED AT THIS PLACE OF PRINCIPLE A LONG , LONG TIME AGO . AND I APPRECIATE THE FACT THAT YOU'RE INCLINED TO HONOR SOMEONE WHO ARRIVED HERE ONLY A FEW YEARS AGO . I'M EVIDENCE THAT YOUR WORK , THAT YOUR RELENTLESS CAMPAIGN TO PROMOTE THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE , BEARS FRUIT . AND I DO FOLLOW , AS KEVIN INDICATED , A LONG LINE OF CONVERTS - GEORGE HERBERT WALKER BUSH , HENRY HYDE , RONALD REAGAN . EACH OF THEM MADE MEANINGFUL CONTRIBUTIONS TO THIS CAUSE . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO SEE THE DOUBLE STANDARD AT WORK HERE . WHEN A PRO-LIFE FIGURE CHANGES TO PRO-CHOICE , IT HARDLY GETS A MENTION . BUT WHEN SOMEONE BECOMES PRO-LIFE , THE PUNDITS GO INTO HIGH DUDGEON . AND SO , I'M HUMBLED AND GRATEFUL TO BE WELCOMED THIS EVENING SO WARMLY AND SO OPENLY . I THINK A LOT OF YOU KNOW THAT YOU WERE ALWAYS WELCOME IN MY OFFICE WHEN I WAS GOVERNOR . TOGETHER WE WORKED ARM-IN-ARM ON A NUMBER OF ISSUES . AND I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS - IF I'M LUCKY ENOUGH TO WIN A COUPLE OF ELECTIONS AHEAD OF ME , THAT WILL ALSO BE THE CASE WHEN I'M PRESIDENT . I'M OFTEN ASKED WHEN I GO TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY , HOW I , AS A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN , COULD POSSIBLY HAVE BEEN ELECTED IN MASSACHUSETTS . AND I TELL THEM THERE WERE THREE THINGS THAT HELPED ACCOUNT FOR A RELATIVELY IMPROBABLE VICTORY . LET ME JUST REVERSE THESE FOR A MOMENT . ONE , OF COURSE , WAS THE STATE WAS IN A FISCAL CRISIS . A MELTDOWN , OF SORTS . BEACON HILL COULDN'T GET BUDGETS DONE ON TIME . ANOTHER BIG TAX HIKE LOOKED LIKE IT WAS ON THE WAY . AND I PROMISED THAT I WOULD BALANCE THE BUDGET WITHOUT RAISING TAXES . AND , AS YOU KNOW , TOGETHER WITH THE LEGISLATURE , THAT'S WHAT WE DID . WE ELIMINATED A $3 BILLION SHORTFALL . AND BY THE TIME I LEFT , OUR SURPLUSES HAD REPLENISHED THE RAINY-DAY FUND TO OVER $2 BILLION . SECOND , WE WERE IN A JOBS CRISIS . WE WERE LOSING JOBS EVERY MONTH IN MASSACHUSETTS . PEOPLE WERE AFRAID . I WENT TO WORK TO BRING JOBS BACK TO OUR STATE . FROM THE END OF THE RECESSION , WE ADDED SOME 60,000 NEW JOBS TO MASSACHUSETTS . AND WE FINALLY GOT OUR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT ACT TOGETHER . IT'S IN LARGE MEASURE RESPONSIBLE FOR A LOT OF THE ECONOMIC GROWTH THAT WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE EVEN TO THIS DAY . AND THIRD , I THINK THAT VALUES ALSO PLAYED A ROLE IN MY CAMPAIGN SUCCESS . MY OPPONENT SAID THAT SHE WOULD SIGN A BILL IN FAVOR OF GAY MARRIAGE . I SAID THAT I OPPOSE GAY MARRIAGE AND CIVIL UNIONS . MY OPPONENT FAVORED BILINGUAL EDUCATION IN SCHOOL , REMEMBER ? I DID NOT . I SAID THAT TO BE SUCCESSFUL IN AMERICA , KIDS NEEDED TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE OF AMERICA . AND AS YOU WILL SURELY RECALL , MY OPPONENT WANTED TO LOWER THE AGE OF CONSENT FOR AN ABORTION FROM 18 TO 16 - AND I SAID NO WAY . AND SO , SOCIAL CONSERVATIVES , MANY OF THEM DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS , JOINED FISCAL CONSERVATIVES TO ELECT A REPUBLICAN . NOW , THAT BEING SAID , I HAD NO INKLING THAT I WAS GOING TO FIND MYSELF IN THE CENTER OF THE BATTLEFIELD ON VIRTUALLY EVERY SOCIAL ISSUE OF OUR TIME AFTER BECOMING GOVERNOR . THE FIRST BATTLE CAME , AS YOU RECALL , WHEN THE MASSACHUSETTS SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT , DECIDED BY A ONE VOTE MAJORITY , THEY FOUND A RIGHT TO SAME-SEX MARRIAGE IN OUR CONSTITUTION . NOW , I'M SURE THAT JOHN ADAMS , WHO WROTE OUR CONSTITUTION , WOULD BE SURPRISED . THE COURT SAID THAT TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE AS WE HAVE KNOWN IT , AND I UNKNOWNWORD HERE , 'IS ROOTED IN PERSISTENT PREJUDICES ,' THAT'S MARRIAGE , IT'S ROOTED IN PERSISTENT PREJUDICES , AND 'WORKS A DEEP AND SCARRING HARDSHIP ... FOR NO RATIONAL REASON .' 'FOR NO RATIONAL REASON ' THEY SAID . HOW ABOUT CHILDREN ? ISN'T MARRIAGE ABOUT THE DEVELOPMENT AND NURTURING OF CHILDREN ? AND ISN'T A CHILD'S DEVELOPMENT ENHANCED BY ACCESS TO BOTH GENDERS , BY HAVING BOTH A MOM AND A DAD . I BELIEVE THAT THE COURT UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE IT FOCUSED ON ADULTS AND ADULT RIGHTS . THEY SHOULD HAVE FOCUSED ON THE RIGHTS OF CHILDREN . THE IDEAL SETTING FOR RAISING A CHILD IS IN A HOME WITH A LOVING MOM AND A LOVING DAD . I CAN TELL BY YOUR APPLAUSE THAT MANY OF YOU JOINED THE EFFORT TO STOP , OR BLOCK OR TO SLOW DOWN THIS VERY UNPRECEDENTED COURT DECISION . WE TOOK EVERY STEP WE COULD THINK OF , WITHIN THE LAW . FIRST , WE PUSHED FOR A STAY - THAT WAS DENIED . THEN , WE FOUGHT FOR AN AMENDMENT UNKNOWNWORD MARRIAGE TO A RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN A MAN AND A WOMAN - THAT LOST IN THE LEGISLATURE BY ONLY TWO VOTES . WE UPHELD THE 1913 LAW THAT PROHIBITED OUT OF STATE COUPLES FROM COMING TO MASSACHUSETTS AND GETTING MARRIED HERE . THAT PREVENTED US FROM BECOMING THE LAS VEGAS OF GAY MARRIAGE . AND IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS , AS YOU KNOW , WE WENT TO WORK TO SECURE A VOTE OF THE CITIZENS , AND THAT'S A BATTLE THAT TOOK US ALL THE WAY TO COURT , WE GOT A WIN THERE . AND NOW WE'RE JUST ONE STEP AWAY FROM PUTTING IT BACK ON THE BALLOT . AND I'M SURE THIS REPRESENTATIVE AND THIS SENATOR WILL GET THE JOB DONE . OF COURSE , THE ISSUE NOW IS WHETHER A SINGLE VOTE MAJORITY OF OUR SUPREME JUDICIAL COURT WILL BE ALLOWED TO TRUMP THE VOICE OF THE PEOPLE IN A DEMOCRACY . IF IT IS , THEN JOHN ADAMS WOULD TRULY BE ASTONISHED . BY THE WAY , WE LEARNED THAT THE PHRASE 'SLIPPERY SLOPE ' DESCRIBES A VERY REAL PHENOMENON BECAUSE THE IMPLICATIONS OF THE MARRIAGE DECISION QUICKLY WENT WELL BEYOND ADULT RIGHTS AND ADULT MARRIAGE . EFFORTS WERE MADE TO CHANGE THE BIRTH UNKNOWNWORD BY REMOVING 'MOTHER ' AND 'FATHER ' AND REPLACING THEM WITH 'PARENT A ' AND 'PARENT B .' I SAID NO TO THAT . AND PARENTS OF A CHILD IN THE 2ND GRADE WERE TOLD THAT THEIR SON HAD TO LISTEN TO A BOOK CALLED THE 'KING AND THE KING ,' ABOUT A PRINCE WHO MARRIES A PRINCE . THE SCHOOL'S RATIONALE WAS SINCE GAY MARRIAGE WAS LEGAL IN MASSACHUSETTS , THERE'S NOTHING WRONG WITH SUCH A POLICY . AND THEN ONE MORE SLIDE ALONG THE SLIPPERY SLOPE . THE CATHOLIC CHURCH WAS FORCED TO END ITS ADOPTION SERVICE , WHICH WAS CRUCIAL IN HELPING THE STATE FIND SOME HOMES FOR SOME OF OUR MOST DIFFICULT TO PLACE CHILDREN . WHY ? BECAUSE THE CHURCH FAVORS PLACEMENTS IN HOMES WITH A MOTHER AND A FATHER . AND NOW , EVEN RELIGIOUS FREEDOM WAS BEING TRUMPED BY THE NEW-FOUND RIGHT OF GAY MARRIAGE . SO YOU KNOW WHY I IMMEDIATELY DRAFTED AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO GRANT RELIGIOUS LIBERTY PROTECTION , BUT THE LEGISLATURE HASN'T TAKEN IT UP YET . NOW , I'VE TAKEN THIS MESSAGE TO WASHINGTON , UNKNOWNWORD THE FAR-REACHING IMPLICATIONS OF THE GAY MARRIAGE DECISION AND THE NEED TO SUPPORT A FEDERAL AMENDMENT TO PROTECT MARRIAGE . I TESTIFIED BEFORE CONGRESS . I WROTE TO EVERY U.S . SENATOR . YOU CAN WRITE TO THEM TOO , BUT THEY DON'T ALWAYS LISTEN . UNFORTUNATELY , SEVERAL SENATORS EVEN FROM MY OWN PARTY VOTED AGAINST THE MARRIAGE AMENDMENT . BUT THAT FIGHT IS NOT OVER . WE'RE GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD TOGETHER , LOCK ARMS TO WIN IT . NOW , IN THE MIDST OF THAT BATTLE , ANOTHER ONE CAME UP . AND IT INVOLVED CLONING AND EMBRYO FARMING FOR THE PURPOSES OF STEM CELL RESEARCH . AND AS KEVIN SAID , I STUDIED THE SUBJECT IN QUITE A BIT OF DEPTH . I HAVE HIGH HOPES FOR STEM CELL RESEARCH . BUT FOR ME , A BRIGHT MORAL LINE IS CROSSED WHEN WE CREATE NEW LIFE FOR THE SOLE PURPOSE OF EXPERIMENTATION AND ULTIMATE DESTRUCTION . THAT'S WHY I FOUGHT TO KEEP CLONING AND EMBRYO FARMING ILLEGAL IN MASSACHUSETTS . IT WAS DURING THIS BATTLE ON CLONING AND EMBRYO FARMING THAT I BEGAN TO FOCUS A GOOD DEAL MORE ATTENTION OF MY OWN VIEWS WITH REGARDS TO ABORTION . AS YOU KNOW , WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR OFFICE , I CONSIDERED WHETHER THIS SHOULD BE A PERSONAL DECISION OR WHETHER IT SHOULD BE A SOCIETAL OR GOVERNMENTAL DECISION . I CONCLUDED , WRONGLY , THAT I WOULD SUPPORT THE LAW AS IT WAS IN PLACE - EFFECTIVELY , A PRO-CHOICE POSITION . AND I WAS WRONG . THE ROE V . WADE MENTALITY HAS SO CHEAPENED THE VALUE OF HUMAN LIFE THAT RATIONAL PEOPLE SAW HUMAN LIFE AS MERE RESEARCH MATERIAL TO BE USED , AND THEN DESTROYED . THE SLIPPERY SLOPE COULD SOON LEAD TO RACKS AND RACKS OF LIVING HUMAN EMBRYOS , BRAVE NEW WORLD-LIKE , AWAITING TERMINATION . WHAT SOME SEE AS A MERE CLUMP OF CELLS IS ACTUALLY A HUMAN LIFE . HUMAN LIFE HAS IDENTITY . HUMAN LIFE HAS THE CAPACITY TO LOVE AND TO BE LOVED . HUMAN LIFE HAS PROFOUND DIGNITY , DIGNITY UNDIMINISHED BY AGE OR INFIRMITY . AND SO I PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGED MY ERROR , AND JOINED WITH YOU TO PROMOTE THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE . AND YOU KNOW THAT MY WORDS WERE MATCHED WITH MY ACTIONS . AS YOU KNOW , EVERY TIME I FACED A DECISION AS THE GOVERNOR THAT RELATED TO HUMAN LIFE , I CAME DOWN ON THE SIDE OF THE SANCTITY OF LIFE . I FOUGHT TO BAN CLONING . I FOUGHT TO BAN EMBRYO FARMING . I FOUGHT TO DEFINE LIFE AS BEGINNING AT CONCEPTION RATHER THAN AT IMPLANTATION . I FOUGHT FOR ABSTINENCE EDUCATION IN OUR SCHOOLS . I VETOED A SO-CALLED EMERGENCY CONTRACEPTION BILL THAT GAVE YOUNG GIRLS DRUGS WITHOUT PRESCRIPTION , DRUGS THAT COULD BE ABORTIVE AND NOT JUST CONTRACEPTIVE . THAT'S MY RECORD AS YOUR GOVERNOR . IT WAS FOUGHT AGAINST LONG ODDS . YOU KNOW THAT , YOU GO UP AGAINST THOSE ODDS EVERY DAY . I ALWAYS UNKNOWNWORD THE STRONG SUPPORT I RECEIVED FROM YOU , THE MEMBERS OF THE PRO-LIFE COMMUNITY , FOR YOUR ACTIONS . NOW OF COURSE YOU RECOGNIZE NOT EVERYONE AGREES WITH ME OR WITH YOU . YOU CAN'T BE A PRO-LIFE GOVERNOR IN A VERY PRO-CHOICE STATE WITHOUT CONSIDERING THAT THERE ARE HEARTFELT AND THOUGHTFUL ARGUMENTS ON BOTH SIDES OF THE QUESTION . AND I CERTAINLY BELIEVE IN TREATING ALL PEOPLE WITH RESPECT AND TOLERANCE . IT'S OUR JOB TO PERSUADE OUR FELLOW CITIZENS OF OUR POSITION . THE PROBLEM IS THAT THERE ARE SOME PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THAT THEIR VIEWS MUST BE IMPOSED ON EVERYONE . MORE AND MORE , THE VEHICLE FOR THIS IMPOSITION IS THE COURTS . SLOWLY BUT SURELY , THE COURTS HAVE TAKEN IT UPON THEMSELVES TO BE THE FINAL ARBITERS OF OUR LIVES . THEY FORGET THAT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL RIGHT IN A DEMOCRACY IS THE RIGHT TO PARTICIPATE IN YOUR OWN GOVERNANCE . MAKE NO MISTAKE : ABORTION AND SAME-SEX MARRIAGE ARE NOT RIGHTS TO BE DISCOVERED IN THE CONSTITUTION . I THINK CHIEF JUSTICE JOHN ROBERTS PUT IT BEST AT HIS CONFIRMATION HEARING . HE DESCRIBED THE ROLE OF A JUDGE . HE SAID , 'JUDGES AND JUSTICES ARE SERVANTS OF THE LAW , NOT THE OTHER WAY AROUND . JUDGES ARE LIKE UMPIRES ,' HE SAID . 'UMPIRES DON'T MAKE THE RULES , THEY APPLY THE UNKNOWNWORD I WILL REMEMBER THAT IT'S MY JOB ,' HE SAID , 'TO CALL BALLS AND STRIKES AND NOT TO PITCH OR BAT .' THAT'S MY KIND OF JUDGE AND THAT'S THE KIND I'D APPOINT . ON THE TENTH ANNIVERSARY OF ROE V . WADE , RONALD REAGAN OBSERVED THAT THE COURT'S DECISION HAD NOT YET SETTLED THE ABORTION DEBATE . IT HAD BECOME AS HE SAID , 'A CONTINUING PROD TO THE CONSCIENCE OF A NATION .' AND NOW , MORE THAN THIRTY YEARS LATER , THAT IS STILL THE CASE . HONORED COURT DECISIONS HAVEN'T SETTLED THIS QUESTION , BUT HAVE FURTHER DIVIDED THE NATION . AND ROE V . WADE CONTINUES TO WORK ITS DESTRUCTIVE LOGIC THROUGHOUT OUR SOCIETY . THIS CAN'T CONTINUE . AT THE HEART OF AMERICAN DEMOCRACY IS THE PRINCIPLE THAT THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL DECISIONS SHOULD ULTIMATELY BE DECIDED BY THE PEOPLE THEMSELVES . WE'RE A DECENT PEOPLE WHO HAVE A COMMITMENT TO THE WORTH AND DIGNITY OF EVERY PERSON , INGRAINED IN OUR HEARTS AND ETCHED IN OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE . SO THESE ARE THE CHALLENGES THAT FACE THE NEXT PRESIDENT : STRENGTHENING OUR COUNTRY AND OUR FAMILIES , PROTECTING MARRIAGE AND HUMAN LIFE AND PRESERVING FOR OUR CHILDREN THE TRUE BLESSINGS OF LIBERTY . THESE ARE NOBLE PURPOSES , WORTHY OF A GREAT PEOPLE . THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH . IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU .
RED	THANK YOU SO MUCH . IT'S AN HONOR TO BE WITH YOU THIS EVENING . OLIVER , THANK YOU FOR YOUR INTRODUCTION . I WANT TO THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADDRESS YOU TONIGHT , AND FOR LETTING ME SHARE IN THE 20TH ANNIVERSARY OF THE SYMS SCHOOL . THANK YOU TO SY SYMS AND HIS FAMILY . TO THE SUPPORTERS , THE PROFESSORS , THE ADMINISTRATORS , THE ALUMNI , AND ALL THE STUDENTS : CONGRATULATIONS ON THIS GREAT EVENT . AS YOU HEARD , I SPENT MOST OF MY LIFE IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR , FIRST BY CONSULTING THE MAJOR CORPORATIONS , AND THEN BY STARTING AND ACQUIRING COMPANIES . IT TAKES CHUTZPAH I BELIEVE TO BUY A COMPANY FROM SOMEBODY ELSE , SOMEONE WHO KNOWS THE BUSINESS INSIDE OUT , SOMEONE WHO HAS DECIDED THAT NOW IS THE BEST TIME TO SELL , SOMEONE WHO HAS HIRED AN INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IT TO EVERYBODY IN THE WORLD , AND THEN TO THINK THAT YOU , HAVING PAID MORE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THE ENTIRE WORLD , YOU SOMEHOW THINK YOU ARE GOING TO MAKE A PROFIT ON YOUR INVESTMENT . IT'S TRULY AN IMPROBABLE WAY TO MAKE A LIVING . BUT IT WORKED , AND FAR BETTER THAN I EVER IMAGINED . DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD YEARS THAT I WAS THE PROUD PARTNER AT UNKNOWNWORD CAPITAL , OUR COMPOUND RATE OF RETURN ON OUR INVESTMENTS EXCEEDED 100 % A YEAR . NOT BAD . NOW , WHAT WAS THE SECRET ? THERE REALLY WASN'T A SECRET . WHAT WE DID IS DONE EVERY DAY BY YOU IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR . WE STARTED OFF WITH GOOD PEOPLE-HIGHLY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD CURIOUS , DRIVEN PEOPLE . WE GATHERED EXTENSIVE DATA AND UNKNOWNWORD OUT UNKNOWNWORD ANALYSIS BEFORE WE MADE OUR DECISIONS . AND THEN WE USED ALL THAT INFORMATION TO DEVELOP A HIGHLY FOCUSED STRATEGY TO MAKE THE ENTERPRISE MORE SUCCESSFUL . I FOUND THAT THE SAME APPROACH WORKS IN THE PUBLIC SECTOR AS WELL . GOOD PEOPLE , DATA , ANALYSIS , FOCUSED STRATEGY . IT'S NOT THE WAY GOVERNMENT USUALLY DOES THINGS , BUT IT'S THE WAY GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO THINGS . TODAY , AMERICA FACES A NUMBER OF CRITICAL CHALLENGES . IN MY VIEW , AT THE TOP OF THE LIST IS THE THREAT OF RADICAL , VIOLENT JIHAD AND THE ASSOCIATED THREAT OF NUCLEAR PROLIFERATION . I THINK MANY OF US , INCLUDING SOME OF OUR LEADERS , FAIL TO COMPREHEND THE EXTENT OF THIS THREAT . TAKE FORMER PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER . PRESIDENT CARTER THINKS THAT ISRAEL'S SECURITY FENCE IS THE THING THAT KEEPS PEACE FROM COMING TO THE HOLY LAND . HAVING JUST BEEN TO ISRAEL , I CAME TO THE OPPOSITE UNKNOWNWORD : THE SECURITY FENCE KEEPS PEACE IN ISRAEL - IT'S HELPING - THAT FENCE IS HELPING PREVENT BLOODSHED AND TERROR AND VIOLENCE . WHAT JIMMY CARTER FAILS TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT SO MANY FAIL TO UNDERSTAND . WHETHER IT'S HAMAS OR HEZBOLLAH ; AL QAEDA OR SHIA AND SUNNI EXTREMISTS , THERE IS AN OVERARCHING GOAL AMONG THE VIOLENT JIHADISTS - AND IT UNKNOWNWORD BORDERS AND BOUNDARIES . THAT GOAL IS TO REPLACE ALL MODERN ISLAMIC STATES WITH A RELIGIOUS CALIPHATE , TO DESTROY ISRAEL , TO CAUSE THE COLLAPSE OF THE WEST AND THE UNITED STATES , AND TO CONQUER THE ENTIRE WORLD . JIHADISM - VIOLENT , RADICAL , FUNDAMENTAL JIHADISM - IS THIS CENTURY'S NIGHTMARE . IT FOLLOWS THE SAME DARK PATH AS LAST CENTURY'S NIGHTMARES : FASCISM AND SOVIET COMMUNISM . THE SEPTEMBER 11TH COMMISSION REPORTED THAT AL-QAEDA HAD BEEN TRYING TO ACQUIRE OR BUILD NUCLEAR WEAPONS FOR WELL OVER A DECADE . FORMER CIA DIRECTOR GEORGE TENET SAID THAT OSAMA BIN LADEN SEES THE UNKNOWNWORD OF WMD AS A UNKNOWNWORD OBLIGATION .' JIHADIST CLERICS HAVE ISSUED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO ... 'DEFEAT THE INFIDELS .' WE ARE FACED WITH THE HORRIFIC PROPOSITION THAT THOSE WHO SPEAK OF GENOCIDE ARE DEVELOPING THE CAPABILITY TO CARRY IT OUT . RADICAL , NUCLEAR JIHAD IS THE GREATEST THREAT THAT FACES HUMANITY . IT CANNOT BE APPEASED . IT CAN ONLY BE DEFEATED . IN MY VIEW , THERE ARE SEVERAL STEPS THAT AMERICA HAS TO TAKE . FIRST , WE HAVE TO SHARPLY INCREASE OUR INVESTMENT IN NATIONAL DEFENSE . I WANT TO SEE AT LEAST 100,000 MORE TROOPS IN OUR MILITARY . I WANT TO SEE US FINALLY MAKE THE LONG OVERDUE INVESTMENT IN EQUIPMENT AND ARMAMENT , WEAPON SYSTEMS , AND STRATEGIC DEFENSE . THAT'S GOING TO REQUIRE THAT WE SPEND AT LEAST 4 PERCENT OF OUR GDP ON DEFENSE . LET ME SHOW YOU , BY THE WAY , A LITTLE HISTORY HERE . LET'S SEE IF I CAN MAKE THIS WORK . THIS SHOWS THE HISTORY AS A PERCENTAGE OF GDP OF THE U.S . MILITARY . AND YOU'LL SEE THAT OVER TIME , WE'VE MADE SOME PRETTY SIGNIFICANT INVESTMENTS IN PROTECTING OUR COUNTRY . IN THE KOREAN WAR , 11.7 % OF THE NATION'S ECONOMIC ACTIVITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PROTECTION OF THIS LAND . DURING THE REAGAN YEARS , IT REACHED APPROXIMATELY 6 % OF OUR GDP . TODAY , IT'S DOWN TO 3.8 % AND I BELIEVE THAT WE HAVE TO INCREASE AT LEAST BY 40-50 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR OUR SPENDING ON MILITARY STRENGTH . SECOND , AMERICA HAS TO BECOME ENERGY INDEPENDENT . OUR ECONOMIC AND MILITARY STRENGTH REQUIRE IT . WE USE 25 % OF THE WORLD'S OIL . ON THIS CHART , YOU SEE WHERE THE OIL COMES FROM . THE UNITED STATES HAS APPROXIMATELY 1.7 % OF THE WORLD'S CRUDE OIL RESERVES . WE OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BECOME ENERGY INDEPENDENT FOR STRATEGIC PURPOSES AND I'M NOT JUST TALKING ABOUT SYMBOLIC MEASURES , I MEAN THAT WE FINALLY HAVE TO TAKE THE NECESSARY STEPS TO ACTUALLY PRODUCE AS MUCH ENERGY AS WE USE . THIRD , WE HAVE TO TRANSFORM OUR INTERNATIONAL CIVILIAN RESOURCES , TO ENHANCE OUR INFLUENCE FOR PEACE , AND FOR SECURITY , AND FOR FREEDOM . JUST AS THE MILITARY IN OUR COUNTRY HAS DIVIDED THE WORLD INTO COMMON REGIONS WITH A SINGLE COMMANDER FOR EACH REGION , OUR CIVILIAN AGENCIES NEED TO DO THE SAME THING . FOURTH , WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR OLD PARTNERSHIPS AND OLD ALLIANCES , AND INAUGURATE A NEW ONE . I AGREE WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER AZNAR OF SPAIN THAT WE SHOULD BUILD ON THE NATO ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAM . AND FURTHER , IF I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT , I'D CALL FOR A NATIONAL SUMMIT OF NATIONS TO CREATE A NEW PARTNERSHIP - A PARTNERSHIP FOR HOPE AND PROSPERITY . THIS PARTNERSHIP WOULD ASSEMBLE THE RESOURCES OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD TO WORK TO ASSURE THAT ISLAMIC STATES THAT ARE THREATENED WITH VIOLENT JIHAD HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS THAT ARE NOT WAHHABI MADRASES ; THAT THEY HAVE MICRO CREDIT AND BANKING , THE RULE OF LAW , HUMAN RIGHTS , BASIC HEALTHCARE , AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC PRACTICES . AND FIFTH , WE HAVE TO KEEP IRAN FROM DEVELOPING A NUCLEAR BOMB . THEIR AMBITION TO DEVELOP NUCLEAR WEAPONRY IS CLEAR : THEY HAVE A VIRTUALLY INEXHAUSTIBLE SUPPLY OF CLEAN NATURAL GAS FOR ENERGY , THEY HAVE REFUSED RUSSIA'S OFFER TO SUPPLY NUCLEAR FUEL FOR THEIR POWER . OBVIOUSLY , THEIR NUCLEAR AMBITION HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH CLEAN ENERGY . AHMADINEJAD HAS GONE BEYOND THE BOUNDARY OF OUTRAGE , BEGINNING WITH HIS CALCULATED DESECRATION OF HISTORY . HIS PURPOSE IS NOT ONLY TO DENY THE HOLOCAUST ; IT IS TO DENY ISRAEL . HE IS DOING WHAT ANOTHER EVIL MAN DID BEFORE HIM : CONDITIONING MINDS TO ACQUIESCE TO THE ELIMINATION OF A PEOPLE . IN JANUARY I WAS AT THE HERZLIYA CONFERENCE AND I DISCUSSED THE THREAT OF IRAN . SINCE THEN , IRAN CONTINUES TO OPERATE ITS NUCLEAR PROGRAM IN UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL . IT'S EXPANDED ITS CENTRIFUGE OPERATIONS IN UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S ISSUED A NEW UNKNOWNWORD THAT FEATURES A RED NUCLEAR SYMBOL SUPERIMPOSED ON THE MAP OF IRAN . EARLIER THIS MONTH , IRAN BOASTED THE PRODUCTION OF NUCLEAR FUEL ON AN 'INDUSTRIAL LEVEL ' WITH A GOAL OF INSTALLING 50,000 CENTRIFUGES . ON APRIL 9TH , IRAN MARKED A NEW NATIONAL HOLIDAY - 'NUCLEAR DAY .' JUST LOOK AT THE EXTENT OF THEIR ACTIVITY . THESE SHOW THE NUCLEAR SITES IN IRAN . THIS IS NOT A LITTLE NARROW PROJECT . DOES THE WORLD UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON HERE ? DO THEY RECOGNIZE THE THREAT WHICH IS POSED BY THIS NUCLEAR-DEVELOPING NATION ? SOME PEOPLE , OF COURSE , THINK THAT IT'S POSSIBLE TO LIVE WITH A NUCLEAR IRAN . THAT THINKING IS BASED ON THE THEORY THAT IRAN , ONCE IT'S GRANTED THE PRIVILEGE OF BECOMING A MEMBER OF THE NUCLEAR CLUB , THAT IT WILL BE A RESPONSIBLE ACTOR . NEITHER THEIR WORDS NOR THEIR ACTIONS UNKNOWNWORD THAT KIND OF THINKING . OTHERS BELIEVE THAT FRANKLY BACK IN THE LOGIC OF DETERRENCE , WHICH SERVED US THROUGH THE COLD WAR - THAT THAT WILL PROTECT US . BUT FOR ALL OF THE SOVIET UNION'S DEEP FLAWS , THEY WERE NEVER SUICIDAL . A SOVIET COMMITMENT TO NATIONAL SURVIVAL WAS NEVER IN QUESTION . AND THAT ASSUMPTION SIMPLY CAN'T BE MADE ABOUT AN IRRATIONAL REGIME THAT UNKNOWNWORD MARTYRDOM LIKE IRAN . IT'S TIME TO TAKE AHMADINEJAD AT HIS WORD AND ACT ACCORDINGLY . WE ARE GOING TO CONTINUE TO WORK , WE'LL WORK WITH THE UN , WE'LL ENCOURAGE CHINA AND RUSSIA TO WORK WITH US AT THE UN SECURITY COUNCIL . BUT THE U.S . AND EUROPE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT . I HAVE PROPOSED A STRATEGY TO COMBAT IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITION . LET ME DESCRIBE JUST A FEW OF THE ELEMENTS . FIRST , WE SHOULD SEVERELY TIGHTEN ECONOMIC SANCTIONS . I THINK THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION DESERVES A LOT OF RECOGNITION FOR RESTRICTING ACCESS TO OUR BANKING AND CREDIT SERVICES , BECAUSE FINANCIAL , AND CREDIT AND MONETARY PENALTIES ARE SOME OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE SANCTIONS THERE ARE . AND WE MUST GET OTHER NATIONS TO ACT NOW TO FOLLOW OUR LEAD . IN MY MEETINGS IN ISRAEL IN JANUARY IT BECAME CLEAR TO ME THAT PENSION FUNDS , SUCH AS THE ONE HERE IN NEW YORK CITY , HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IN COMPANIES LIKE THE FRENCH OIL UNKNOWNWORD , TOTAL . AFTER NEW YORK STATE NAMED ITS COMPTROLLER , I WROTE HIM , AND I ALSO WROTE TO GOVERNOR SPITZER , AND SENATORS UNKNOWNWORD AND CLINTON AND URGED THEM TO DISINVEST FROM COMPANIES THAT HAVE SIGNIFICANT OPERATIONS IN COLLABORATION WITH IRANIAN REGIMES . SECOND , I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO ISOLATE IRAN DIPLOMATICALLY . THEIR LEADERS SHOULD BE MADE TO FEEL EXACTLY LIKE THOSE OF APARTHEID SOUTH AFRICA , OR WORSE . THAT'S WHY I ORDERED THE STATE POLICE OF MASSACHUSETTS TO REFUSE SECURITY DETAILS FOR FORMER IRANIAN PRESIDENT KHATAMI WHEN HE CAME TO HARVARD . OF COURSE , WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD AND TALK WITH IRAN AND I SUPPORT THE UPCOMING EFFORTS TO DISCUSS SECURITY IN IRAQ WITH IRAQ'S LEADERS AND THEIR NEIGHBORS IN THE REGION . BUT UNTIL THERE ARE UNKNOWNWORD THAT HIGH LEVEL ENGAGEMENT WOULD DO ANYTHING OTHER THAN REWARD BAD BEHAVIOR , I DON'T BELIEVE THAT WE SHOULD BE ENGAGING IRAN IN DIRECT , BILATERAL NEGOTIATIONS OVER THEIR NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM . IRAN'S NUCLEAR INTRANSIGENCE IS REPULSIVE TO THE ENTIRE WORLD AND WE SHOULDN'T LET IRAN TRY TO POSITION IT AS AN IRAN UNKNOWNWORD . A US THING . NOW THERE IS ONE PLACE OF COURSE WHERE I'D WELCOME AHMADINEJAD WITH OPEN ARMS : AND THAT'S IN A COURT WHERE HE WOULD STAND TRIAL FOR INCITEMENT TO GENOCIDE , UNDER THE TERMS OF THE GENOCIDE CONVENTION . THERE'S A THIRD EFFORT . ARAB STATES NEED TO JOIN THIS EFFORT TO PREVENT A NUCLEAR IRAN . THESE STATES CAN DO A LOT MORE THAN JUST WRING THEIR HANDS AND URGE AMERICA TO DO ALL THE WORK . THEY SHOULD SUPPORT IRAQ'S UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT ; THEY CAN HELP AMERICA'S FOCUS ON IRAN QUICKLY BY TURNING DOWN THE TEMPERATURE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD CONFLICT ; THEY CAN STOP THE FINANCIAL AND WEAPONS FLOWS TO HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; AND THEY MUST TELL THEIR UNKNOWNWORD FRIENDS TO DROP THEIR CAMPAIGN OF TERROR AND RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST . THIS ONE'S A LITTLE SENSITIVE . LISTEN CAREFULLY . FOURTH , WE HAVE TO MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE IRANIAN PEOPLE THAT WHILE NUCLEAR CAPABILITIES MAY BE THE SOURCE OF PRIDE , THEY CAN ALSO BE A SOURCE OF PERIL . IF NUCLEAR MATERIAL FROM IRAN FALLS INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND IS USED , IT WOULD PROVOKE A DEVASTATING RESPONSE FROM THE ENTIRE CIVILIZED WORLD TO THE VERY NATION THAT SUPPLIED IT . THERE IS YET ANOTHER SOURCE OF JIHADIST NUCLEAR DANGER , BEYOND IRAN . IT'S THE PURSUIT BY JIHADISTS OF ACQUIRING WHAT ARE COMMONLY KNOWN AS 'LOOSE NUKES .' THE GLOBAL INITIATIVE TO COMBAT NUCLEAR TERRORISM , WHICH WAS LAUNCHED LAST YEAR , WAS A GOOD START , BUT WE NEED TO ACCELERATE AND EXPAND IT . FIRST , I'D APPOINT A SENIOR AMERICAN OFFICIAL TO SERVE AS AMBASSADOR-AT-LARGE TO PREVENT NUCLEAR TERROR . HE OR SHE WOULD HAVE THE AUTHORITY AND RESOURCES TO WORK ACROSS AGENCIES AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNITED STATES TO ENSURE THAT OUR STRATEGIES ARE COORDINATED HERE , AND ABROAD . FURTHER , I'D PROMOTE AN INTERNATIONAL INITIATIVE TO DEVELOP A NEW BODY OF INTERNATIONAL LAW THAT WOULD MAKE NUCLEAR TRAFFICKING A CRIME AGAINST HUMANITY , ON A PAR WITH GENOCIDE AND WAR CRIMES . AND BY ALLOWING FOR UNIVERSAL JURISDICTION , CHARGES CAN BE BROUGHT UP AT ANY COURT , TO HELP PREVENT TRAFFICKERS FROM HIDING IN COMPLICIT OR WEAK COUNTRIES . ALREADY , PEOPLE HAVE BEEN CAUGHT TRYING TO SMUGGLE NUCLEAR MATERIALS TO SELL THEM ON THE BLACK MARKET . THEIR ACTS SHOULDN'T BE UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE KIND OF NONCHALANCE THAT SOMETIMES UNKNOWNWORD ROUTINE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE LAWS . COUNTRIES THAT WANT TO USE NUCLEAR POWER FOR PEACEFUL PURPOSES SHOULD CONVENE TO REAFFIRM THEIR COMMITMENT TO NON-PROLIFERATION . FOR YEARS NOW , WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY AS THE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT RECENT TECHNOLOGICAL AND POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD SUGGEST THAT THE BARGAIN AT THE CENTER OF THIS EFFORT NEEDS TO BE UPDATED . WE NEED TO SET A 'GOLD STANDARD ' FOR SECURITY , GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM THAT STILL EXISTS IN THE WORLD . LET ME SHOW YOU WHERE IT IS . THE COUNTRIES IN RED ARE COUNTRIES THAT HAVE OVER TEN THOUSAND UNKNOWNWORD OF HIGHLY ENRICHED URANIUM AND VARIOUS RESEARCH FACILITIES AROUND THEIR LANDS . AS YOU LOOK AT THAT , YOU RECOGNIZE WHY IT IS THAT WE DON'T WANT TO BREAK OFF DISCUSSIONS WITH RUSSIA . THERE'S A LOT OF COOPERATION THAT WE NEED TO KEEP IN PLACE WITH RUSSIA , BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT TO BE ENGAGED IN FRANK AND OPEN DISCUSSIONS ABOUT THE SERIOUS AND DISTURBING TURN OF EVENTS IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY . BUT WE ALSO HAVE TO REMAIN A PARTNER WITH THEM ON THE ISSUE OF SECURING THE VAST AMOUNT OF HIGHLY ENRICHED NUCLEAR MATERIAL IN THEIR COUNTRY . FINALLY , THE UNITED STATES IN MY VIEW SHOULD TAKE THE LEAD IN ORGANIZING AN INTERNATIONAL FUEL BANK , WHICH WOULD GUARANTEE LOW-COST SUPPLIES OF NUCLEAR REACTOR FUEL TO COUNTRIES WILLING TO UNKNOWNWORD BY VERY HIGH STANDARDS FOR SAFETY AND SECURITY . THE THREAT FROM JIHAD IS REAL AND IT IS EXACERBATED BY THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS . TODAY , OVER HALF THE REGION IS UNDER 22 YEARS OLD . THE COMBINED GDP OF ALL ARAB NATIONS , INCLUDING THEIR OIL REVENUE , IS LESS THAN UNKNOWNWORD . THINK OF THAT . AND WITH THE GROWING POPULATION AND LACK OF JOBS , THE GROUND FOR RADICAL ISLAM WILL BE INCREASINGLY FERTILE . LET ME SHOW YOU SOME SLIDES I THINK ARE PRETTY INTERESTING . THIS SHOWS THE MAP OF THE WORLD DRAWN TO THE SCALE OF WHERE THE PROPORTION OF THE WORLD'S WEALTH WAS IN 1960 . LOOK AT THE UNITED STATES - EXTRAORDINARY WEALTH , LARGER THAN ANY OTHER LAND IN THE WORLD BY FAR . EUROPE IS SHOWN IN THE PINKISH COLORS THERE - THAT'S WESTERN EUROPE . THE BLUE IS EASTERN EUROPE AND THEN YOU'LL SEE AFRICA OF COURSE VERY SMALL IN TERMS OF PORTION OF THE ECONOMY OF THE WORLD . THE MIDDLE EAST IS IN THE LIGHT GREEN . YOU CAN SEE INDIA THERE IN THE YELLOW , RIGHT NEXT TO INDIA , TO THE WEST OF INDIA IS OF COURSE PAKISTAN . CHINA IS THE BRIGHT GREEN AND JAPAN IS THE PURPLE . LOOK HOW THAT CHANGES AS PROJECTED FOR 2015 . LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO CHINA . LOOK WHAT HAPPENS TO EUROPE . BUT THE MIDDLE EAST CONTINUES TO BE EXTRAORDINARILY SMALL IN TERMS OF ITS ECONOMIC CLOUT . AND NORTHERN AFRICA , WHERE JIHAD IS ALSO RAMPANT , IS A UNKNOWNWORD PORTION OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMIC VITALITY IN THE YEAR 2015 . THIS IS AS PROJECTED BY THE UN . WHERE ARE THE BABIES BEING BORN ? LET'S LOOK AT THE SAME MAP , BUT INSTEAD OF DRAWING IT BASED UPON WHERE THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH IS , LET'S SHOW WHERE BABIES ARE BEING BORN . THAT'S WHERE POPULATION WILL BE AS OF 2050 . THE VERY PLACES THAT HAVE THE LEAST INCOME HAVE THE EXTRAORDINARY GROWTH IN POPULATION . AND THIS IS THE VERY FERTILE AND VERY UNKNOWNWORD FIELD THAT WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO UNKNOWNWORD . AND SO BECAUSE OF THIS AND MANY OTHER REASONS IN THE FINAL ANALYSIS , ONLY MUSLIMS ARE GOING TO BE ABLE TO DEFEAT RADICAL JIHAD . BUT WE CAN AND WE MUST SUPPORT MODERATE MUSLIMS IN REJECTING THE EXTREME AND ACCEPTING MODERNITY . WE SHOULD REMEMBER THAT IN THE TWO OTHER GLOBAL CONFRONTATIONS WITH TOTALITARIANISM IN THE PAST CENTURY , IT WASN'T ALWAYS OBVIOUS THAT WE'D WIN . INDEED , IN THOSE CONFLICTS , THE BALANCE OF POWER WAS NOT ALWAYS IN OUR FAVOR . THOSE WERE WARS WE COULD HAVE LOST , BUT WE DIDN'T . IN THE CURRENT CONFLICT , DEFEAT IS NOT NEARLY AS DANGEROUSLY CLOSE AS IT WAS DURING THE DARKEST MOMENTS OF THE SECOND WORLD WAR AND THE COLD WAR . THERE'S NO COMPARISON BETWEEN THE ECONOMIC AND DIPLOMATIC , AND MILITARY RESOURCES OF THE CIVILIZED WORLD AND THOSE OF THE TERRORIST NETWORKS THAT THREATEN US TODAY . IN THOSE PREVIOUS GLOBAL WARS , THERE WERE MANY WAYS TO LOSE , AND VICTORY WAS FAR FROM GUARANTEED . IN THE CURRENT CONFLICT , THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY TO LOSE , AND THAT IS IF WE AS A CIVILIZED WORLD DECIDE NOT TO LIFT A FINGER TO DEFEND OURSELVES , OR OUR VALUES , AND OUR WAY OF LIFE . I WILL NOT BE SILENT , YOU WILL NOT BE SILENT . TODAY , WE CAN LEAD THE WORLD . WE CAN AND WE MUST LEAD THE WORLD TO DO WHAT IT HAS SOUGHT FOR SO MANY CENTURIES-TO ACCEPT DIFFERENT PEOPLE AND DIFFERENT CULTURES , TO RESPECT THE INALIENABLE RIGHTS OF EVERY CHILD OF GOD , AND TO WELCOME A TIME OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR ALL THE CHILDREN OF OUR CREATOR . THANK YOU SO MUCH .
RED	THANKS ... IT IS AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS AWARD AND TO BE ASSOCIATED IN A SMALL WAY WITH THE LEGACY OF PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO FOUGHT TIRELESSLY TO LIFT THE NATION . I'M SURE HE WOULD BE CHEERING THE LIFE AFFIRMING DECISION OF THE SUPREME COURT . THE GREAT ISSUES OF OUR TIMES - THE LIFE AND DEATH ISSUES - SHOULD BE , AS THIS COURT REALIZES , IN THE HANDS OF THE PEOPLE AND THE DEMOCRATIC PROCESS . BUT OUR HEARTS ARE MORE HEAVY THAN BUOYANT TONIGHT . THEY ARE HEAVY WITH THE AWFUL WEIGHT THAT RESTS ON THEM . THE WEIGHT OF LOST LIVES , LOST SENSELESSLY , PURPOSELESSLY , UNKNOWNWORD . AS OUR PACE SLOWS , WE CAN LOOK BEYOND THE TUMULT OF DAILY LIVING INTO THE WELLS OF DEEPER MEANING , AND PERHAPS WE CAN LEARN ONE OF LIFE'S SOLEMN UNKNOWNWORD . ANN AND I SPENT MONDAY AT OUR HOME ON A LAKE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . IT WAS A GREY DAY WITH RECORD RAINFALL . THE LAKE ICE HAD STILL NOT ENTIRELY MELTED - BUT IT WAS GIVING WAY TO THE WAVES AND THE RAIN . INSIDE , WAS TOASTY WARM . OUR ENTIRE FAMILY HAD GATHERED - ALL 22 OF US . PARKER MITT IS CRAWLING ; OWEN JUST SCOOTS . ELEVEN YEAR OLD ALLIE READS BETTER THAN A FEW OF THE ADULTS . THIS NEW ROMNEY GENERATION HAS BEEN PLANTED IN GOOD HOMES . A CALL FROM THE OFFICE TOLD ME ABOUT THE TRAGEDY IN VIRGINIA . I WENT OUTSIDE TO LET THE NEWS PENETRATE . I COULD SEE MY FAMILY THROUGH THE WINDOWS . I TRIED TO IMAGINE THE UNKNOWNWORD I WOULD FEEL IN LOSING ONE OF THEM . BUT I COULDN'T DO IT . IT WAS SIMPLY BEYOND MY IMAGINATION . THERE IS A GREAT DEAL IN LIFE , IT SEEMS , THAT CAN ONLY BE UNDERSTOOD IF IT IS ACTUALLY EXPERIENCED . MY HEART UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE PARENTS AND FAMILIES OF THE FALLEN , EVEN THOUGH I KNOW I CANNOT FULLY COMPREHEND THE DEPTH OF THEIR LOSS . I PRAY FOR THEM . WHAT ARE WE TO MAKE OF WHAT HAPPENED AT VIRGINIA TECH ? YOU MAY HAVE ALREADY DRAWN YOUR OWN LESSONS . OTHERS WILL BE ADDED OVER DAYS AND WEEKS BY BOTH THE THOUGHTFUL AND THE THOUGHTLESS . I HOPE THAT YOU WILL FIND WHAT I HAVE TO OFFER TONIGHT TO BE IN THE FORMER CATEGORY . I PICKED UP MY BIBLE YESTERDAY TO RE-READ THE ACCOUNT OF THE SENSELESS MURDER OF ABEL BY HIS BROTHER . IT'S ONLY ONE PAGE AFTER THE FALL OF ADAM AND EVE FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE THEY WERE TOLD BY GOD THAT HE WOULD PLACE WHAT HE CALLED ENMITY ON THE EARTH . THERE IS A LESSON BEING TAUGHT : EVIL AND GOOD HAVE BEEN HERE FROM THE BEGINNING . CAIN UNKNOWNWORD HIS YOUNGER BROTHER ABEL BECAUSE HE WAS JEALOUS OF HIM , ANGRY THAT HE WAS MORE FAVORED . EVIL IS NOT GOING TO SIMPLY GO AWAY . WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO LEARN TO LIVE IN A WORLD THAT HAS EVIL AS WELL AS GOOD . PERHAPS THAT SOUNDS OBVIOUS . I THINK IT IS . BUT WHEN HITLER WROTE OF HIS GENOCIDAL PLANS , EDUCATED PEOPLE SIMPLY COULDN'T BELIEVE THAT SUCH EVIL WAS POSSIBLE . THE SAME IS TRUE OF AHMADINEJAD TODAY - HIS EVIL IS EXCUSED BY THOSE WHO CANNOT BRING THEMSELVES TO BELIEVE THAT EVIL LIKE THAT ACTUALLY EXISTS IN THE HEART OF MAN . FOLLOWING THE END OF THE COLD WAR , PRESIDENT CLINTON BEGAN TO DISMANTLE OUR MILITARY . HE REDUCED OUR FORCES BY 500,000 . HE RETIRED ALMOST 80 SHIPS . OUR SPENDING ON NATIONAL DEFENSE DROPPED FROM OVER 6 % OF GDP TO 3.8 % TODAY . HE CALLED IT A PEACE DIVIDEND . WE GOT THE DIVIDEND , BUT WE DIDN'T GET THE PEACE . UNKNOWNWORD KRAUTHAMMER CALLED OUR BLISSFUL DISARMAMENT A HOLIDAY FROM HISTORY . FOR HISTORY HAS PLAINLY TAUGHT THAT EVIL IS ON EARTH AND THAT THERE ARE EVIL PEOPLE WHO WILL THREATEN THE GOOD , THE PEACEFUL AND THE FREE . THERE IS NO QUESTION IN MY MIND THAT IF THE OPPOSITION PARTY HAD FULL REIGN IN WASHINGTON , WE WOULD NOT ONLY WITHDRAW WITHOUT REGARD TO CONSEQUENCE FROM IRAQ , WE WOULD ALSO CONTINUE TO REDUCE MILITARY SPENDING TO FINANCE SOCIAL PROGRAMS . SOME WOULD CELEBRATE , UNKNOWNWORD THAT THEY ARE GOING TO GIVE PEACE A CHANCE . BUT PEACE HAS HAD MANY CHANCES AND IT WILL HAVE MANY MORE . HISTORY TEACHES US THIS : THE BEST ALLY OF PEACE IS A STRONG AMERICA . AS RONALD REAGAN SAID : OF THE FOUR WARS IN MY LIFETIME , NONE CAME ABOUT BECAUSE THE U.S . WAS TOO STRONG . AND IT WAS ALSO PRESIDENT REAGAN WHO LABELED THE SOVIET UNION AN EVIL EMPIRE - MUCH TO THE HORROR OF FOREIGN POLICY ELITES . YET HE WAS RIGHT . TWENTY YEARS LATER , PRESIDENT BUSH WAS CRITICIZED FOR LABELING CERTAIN COUNTRIES PART OF THE AXIS OF EVIL . AGAIN , FOREIGN POLICY ELITES RECOILED . BUT WHAT THESE ELITES FAIL TO RECOGNIZE IS THAT RADICAL ISLAM HAS AS ITS INTENTION THE OVERTHROW OF ALL MODERATE ISLAMIC GOVERNMENTS ... CALIPHATE ... COLLAPSE OF THE WEST AND THE US . TODAY , IRAN IS WORKING TO DEVELOP A NUCLEAR BOMB ... IRAN , WHOSE PRESIDENT DENIES THE HISTORY OF HOLOCAUST AND CALLS FOR THE DESTRUCTION OF THE NATION FOUNDED BY ITS EMACIATED YET HOPEFUL SURVIVORS . EVIL INDEED EXISTS IN THE WORLD . THE RIGHT COURSE FOR AMERICA IN A WORLD WHERE EVIL STILL EXISTS IS NOT ACQUIESCENCE AND WEAKNESS , IT IS ASSERTIVENESS AND STRENGTH . I WOULD LIKE TO SEE US ADD AT LEAST 100,000 TROOPS TO OUR MILITARY , INCREASE DEFENSE SPENDING TO AT LEAST 4 % OF OUR GDP , AND RE-ORGANIZE OUR NON-MILITARY RESOURCES TO SUPPORT MODERATE , MODERN MUSLIM PEOPLE AND NATIONS . SOME OF OUR CITIZENS SEE THE EVIL IN THE WORLD , BUT ARGUE THAT WE SHOULD SIMPLY ISOLATE OURSELVES FROM IT . BUT ONE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVIL IS THAT IT SEEKS DOMINATION OVER OTHERS , ALL OTHERS . HITLER WAS POISED TO CONQUER ONE LAST EUROPEAN ISLAND AND JAPAN HAD ATTACKED OUR PACIFIC FLEET - THERE IS NO SAFE PLACE IF EVIL IS UNKNOWNWORD . THE WEAK MAY HIDE , BUT THEY BECOME WEAKER STILL , UNTIL AT LAST THEY ARE DISCOVERED , AND EASILY CONQUERED . IT IS UP TO US TO KEEP AMERICA STRONG . AND WHILE WE WILL ALWAYS DEFEND AMERICA ON OUR OWN IF EVER CALLED , WE KNOW OUR STRENGTH IS AMPLIFIED WHEN IT IS COMBINED WITH THE STRENGTH OF OTHER NATIONS . WHETHER DIPLOMATIC , ECONOMIC , OR MILITARY , AMERICA IS STRONGER WHEN WE HAVE FRIENDS STANDING WITH US . I AGREE WITH FORMER PRIME MINISTER AZNAR OF SPAIN THAT WE SHOULD BUILD ON THE NATO ALLIANCE TO DEFEAT RADICAL ISLAM . AND FURTHER , IF I WERE FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WOULD CALL FOR A SUMMIT OF NATIONS TO CREATE A NEW PARTNERSHIP - A PARTNERSHIP FOR HOPE AND PROSPERITY . THIS PARTNERSHIP WOULD ASSEMBLE THE RESOURCES OF ALL THE NATIONS OF THE DEVELOPED WORLD TO WORK TO ASSURE THAT ISLAMIC STATES THAT ARE THREATENED WITH VIOLENT JIHAD HAVE PUBLIC SCHOOLS , NOT WAHHABI MADRASES , MICRO CREDIT AND BANKING , THE RULE OF LAW , HUMAN RIGHTS , BASIC HEALTHCARE , AND COMPETITIVE ECONOMIC POLICIES . THE RESOURCES WOULD BE DRAWN FROM PUBLIC AND PRIVATE INSTITUTIONS , AND FROM VOLUNTEERS AND UNKNOWNWORD . TOGETHER , WE WOULD BE LAYING THE GROUNDWORK OF FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY . MERELY CLOSING OUR EYES AND HOPING THAT RADICAL JIHAD WILL GO AWAY IS NOT AN ACCEPTABLE ANSWER . AND AMERICAN MILITARY ACTION ALONE CANNOT CHANGE THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF MUSLIMS . ONLY MUSLIMS WILL BE ABLE TO DEFEAT RADICAL JIHAD . BUT WE CAN HELP THEM . AND WE MUST HELP THEM . FOR THE CONSEQUENCES FOR AMERICA AND FOR ALL NATIONS OF A RADICALIZED ISLAMIC WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR WEAPONS , ARE UNTHINKABLE . IT IS ANOTHER ATTRIBUTE OF EVIL TO CALL ITSELF GOOD AND TO LABEL THE GOOD AS EVIL . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO MOST AMERICANS THAT BIN LADEN AND AHMADINEJAD AND CHAVEZ CALL US , AMERICA , EVIL . BUT MILLENNIA AGO , ISAIAH , A PROPHET OF THE OLD TESTAMENT , SAID THIS : WOE UNKNOWNWORD THEM THAT CALL EVIL GOOD , AND GOOD EVIL ; THAT PUT DARKNESS FOR LIGHT , AND LIGHT FOR DARKNESS ; THAT PUT BITTER FOR SWEET AND SWEET FOR BITTER ! AND SO , WE SHOULD NOT BE TERRIBLY SURPRISED WHEN WE ARE SO WIDELY SCORNED BY THESE PURVEYORS OF HATE . BUT WE ARE NOT ENTIRELY WITHOUT FAULT . WE CAN . AND SHOULD . DO A BETTER JOB TO PROMOTE FREEDOM . WHEN LEBANON'S NEW LEADERSHIP WAS FACING THE TEST OF DEMOCRACY , WE WATCHED AS HEZBOLLAH BROUGHT THE UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE SCHOOLS AND HEALTHCARE . OUR RESOURCES COULD HAVE HELPED BUT THEY ARE ALL HOUSED IN SEPARATE BUREAUCRACIES , INTENT ON PROTECTING THEIR OWN POWERS AND BUDGETS AND PREROGATIVES . SO GUESS WHO THE PEOPLE FOLLOWED WHEN CONFLICT BROKE OUT ? AND SO TOO FOR HAMAS AMONG THE PALESTINIANS . THE PROBLEM WAS JUST AS EVIDENT IN IRAQ . WHILE THE MILITARY MOVED IN RAPID ORDER TO UNKNOWNWORD SADDAM HUSSEIN , OUR NON-MILITARY RESOURCES MOVED LIKE THEY WERE STUCK IN TAR . THEY FIGHT OVER WHICH AGENCY WILL PAY THE $11.00 PER DIEM COST OF FOOD AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE ARE SPENDING $7 BILLION A MONTH AND TAKING HUMAN CASUALTIES . IT IS HIGH TIME TO TRANSFORM OUR CIVILIAN INSTRUMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER . JUST AS THE MILITARY HAS DIVIDED THE WORLD INTO COMMON REGIONS WITH A SINGLE COMMANDER , OUR CIVILIAN AGENCIES MUST NOW FOLLOW SUIT . WITH A SINGLE CIVILIAN LEADER , WHO LIKE THEIR MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD IS FULLY EMPOWERED WITH AUTHORITY , RESPONSIBILITY AND RESOURCES , WE CAN SPREAD OUR GREAT INSTRUMENTS OF PEACE , LIKE HEALTH CARE AND THE RULE OF LAW TO NATIONS EVERYWHERE . IT IS TIME THAT WE APPLY THESE AMERICAN WONDERS TO MAKE THE WORLD , AND IN TURN TO MAKE AMERICA , A SAFER , FREER , AND MORE PROSPEROUS PLACE . AND SO , WE CAN PROJECT AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND ITS GOODNESS TO THE WORLD . BUT WE CANNOT PROJECT MORE STRENGTH AND MORE GOODNESS THAN WE ACTUALLY HAVE . WHAT IS THEIR SOURCE ? MY LIBERAL FRIENDS WOULD SAY THAT AMERICA IS GREAT BECAUSE OF OUR GREAT GOVERNMENT . IT IS A GREAT GOVERNMENT . BUT THAT IS NOT THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH . THE SOURCE OF AMERICA'S STRENGTH IS THE AMERICAN PEOPLE - HARD WORKING , EDUCATED , RISK TAKING , GOD-LOVING , FAMILY-ORIENTED , SACRIFICING , PATRIOTIC , FREEDOM-LOVING AMERICAN PEOPLE . THEY ALWAYS HAVE BEEN THE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH AND THEY ALWAYS WILL BE ! I HAVE GREAT FAITH IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I HAVE FAITH IN OUR CHILDREN , AND IN OUR GRANDCHILDREN . BUT AT THE SAME TIME , I AM DEEPLY TROUBLED BY THE CULTURE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEM TODAY . FOLLOWING THE COLUMBINE UNKNOWNWORD , PEGGY NOONAN WROTE AN ARTICLE DESCRIBING WHAT SHE CALLED THE OCEAN IN WHICH OUR CHILDREN SWIM . IT WAS A CESSPOOL OF VIOLENCE , SEX , DRUGS , INDOLENCE , PERVERSION . SHE SAID THAT THE BOYS WHO DID THE SHOOTING HAD INHALED TOO DEEP THE OCEAN IN WHICH THEY UNKNOWNWORD . I'D LIKE TO CLEAN UP THE WATER IN WHICH OUR KIDS ARE SWIMMING . I'D LIKE TO KEEP PORNOGRAPHY FROM COMING UP ON KID'S COMPUTERS . I'D LIKE TO KEEP DRUGS OFF THE STREETS . I'D LIKE TO SEE LESS VIOLENCE AND SEX ON TV AND IN UNKNOWNWORD AND IN VIDEO GAMES . IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT THIS , WE CAN DO A GREAT DEAL MORE TO CLEAN THE SWIMMING WATER . BUT THERE'S ANOTHER THING I'D LIKE TO DO AS WELL . I REMEMBER SWIMMING ONE AFTERNOON IN LAKE HURON , ONE OF THE GREAT LAKES . MY FRIEND TOMMY MCCAFFREY AND I WERE 11 OR 12 AS I RECALL . THE LAKE WAS UNKNOWNWORD , WITH 4 FOOT WAVES BREAKING AT THE SECOND SANDBAR . WE WERE UNKNOWNWORD TO STAY IN CLOSE , BUT WE UNKNOWNWORD OUT TOO DEEP , AND FOUND OURSELVES BEING DRAWN BEYOND OUR RESISTANCE . THEN SUDDENLY MRS . MCCAFFREY WAS THERE , GRABBING US BOTH BY THE ARM . SHE HAD HER UNKNOWNWORD ON . AND HER FACE , IT WAS SERIOUS . AND IT WAS SET LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD SHORE . I DON'T REMEMBER WHAT SHE SAID . BUT I REMEMBER WHAT I FELT : THANKFUL ! I'D LIKE THERE TO BE A LOT MORE MRS . MCCAFFREY'S . I BELIEVE THAT THE MOST IMPORTANT WORK BEING DONE TO STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S FUTURE IS THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE WITHIN THE 4 WALLS OF THE AMERICAN HOME . AS A CHILD SWIMS THROUGH OUR INCREASINGLY POLLUTED AND UNKNOWNWORD WATERS , THERE IS NO HELP THAT IS MORE SURE THAN A LOVING MOTHER AND FATHER . IT IS TIME THAT WE SAY WHAT WE KNOW : EVERY CHILD DESERVES A MOTHER AND A FATHER . I KNOW THAT MANY PEOPLE ARE PESSIMISTIC ABOUT THE FUTURE . THE NEW GENERATION OF CHALLENGES IS DAUNTING . FREEDOM CONFRONTS ENEMIES ON FAR-FLUNG UNKNOWNWORD , AND ITS CHILDREN OF PROMISE MUST NAVIGATE THE TROUBLED WATERS AT HOME . ABIGAIL ADAMS WROTE TO HER SON WHEN HE WAS CONCERNED ABOUT THE FUTURE OF OUR DEMOCRACY GREAT NECESSITIES , SHE SAID , BRING FORTH GREAT VIRTUES . AND SO IT IS . I SEE THEM IN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THE COUNTRY . I HAVE SEEN THEM THROUGHOUT MY LIFE . ON MONDAY WE SAW GOOD AND EVIL IN STARK UNKNOWNWORD AT A CAMPUS IN VIRGINIA . AND WHILE WE'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER THE EVIL , WE MUST ALSO REMEMBER THE GOOD . LIVIU LIBRESCU , AN ENGINEERING PROFESSOR AT VIRGINIA TECH , WAS A HOLOCAUST SURVIVOR . IT'S FAIR TO SAY THAT HE HAD ALREADY EXPERIENCED THE WORST EVIL IMAGINABLE . YET ON MONDAY HE DIED WHILE BARRING THE CLASSROOM DOOR WITH HIS BODY SO HIS STUDENTS COULD UNKNOWNWORD OUT OF THE WINDOWS TO ESCAPE A BRUTAL KILLER . AS A POSTING ON A WEBSITE SAID , THOUGH NOT IN HEIGHT , HE WAS IN SO MANY OTHER WAYS A MAN OF STATURE . AMERICA IS A NATION OF STATURE , THANKS TO MEN LIKE PROFESSOR LIBRESCU , THANKS TO BRAVE AND PATRIOTIC SOLDIERS AROUND THE WORLD , THANKS TO GREAT AND NOBLE MEN AND WOMEN ACROSS THE COUNTRY . IT IS WHY WE KNOW THAT AMERICA WILL RISE TO THE OCCASION OF TODAY'S CHALLENGES . IT IS WHY WE CAN BE CONFIDENT THAT , IN THE WORDS OF ONE GREAT AMERICAN THIS NATION , WILL ALWAYS REMAIN A SHINING CITY ON A HILL .
RED	THANK YOU , MY FRIENDS , AND THANK YOU , SOUTH CAROLINA , FOR BRINGING US ACROSS THE FINISH LINE FIRST IN THE FIRST IN THE SOUTH PRIMARY . IT TOOK US A WHILE , BUT WHAT'S EIGHT YEARS AMONG FRIENDS . IT JUST GAVE US THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEND MORE TIME IN THIS BEAUTIFUL STATE ; TO TALK WITH YOU AND LISTEN TO YOU ; AND TO COME TO ADMIRE ALL THE MORE THE DEEP PATRIOTISM OF SOUTH CAROLINIANS , WHO HAVE SACRIFICED SO MUCH TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM ITS ENEMIES . IT IS A GREAT PRIVILEGE TO HAVE COME TO KNOW SO MANY OF YOU , AND I AM VERY GRATEFUL FOR AND HUMBLED BY THE SUPPORT YOU HAVE GIVEN OUR CAMPAIGN . THANK YOU ESPECIALLY , FOR BRAVING THE VERY UNKNOWNWORD CAROLINA LIKE WEATHER TODAY TO EXERCISE THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OF AN AMERICAN ; NOT JUST THOSE SOUTH CAROLINIANS WHO VOTED FOR US , BUT ALL OF YOU WHO VOTED TODAY FOR THE CANDIDATE YOU BELIEVE IS BEST SUITED TO LEAD THE COUNTRY YOU LOVE . I THINK I CAN SPEAK FOR ALL OF THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDAT UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN I SAY , SOUTH CAROLINIANS ARE NEVER JUST FAIR WEATHER FRIENDS . AND , OF COURSE , I AM DEEPLY GRATEFUL TO OUR SOUTH CAROLINA TEAM , AND TO THE MANY DEDICATED VOLUNTEERS WHO GAVE SO GENEROUSLY OF THEIR TIME AND LABOR AND KEPT US COMPETITIVE IN SOME PRETTY CHALLENGING TIMES . I HOPE YOU KNOW HOW MUCH YOUR FRIENDSHIP MEANS TO ME . THE DEBT I OWE YOU IS A PRIVILEGE AND AN OBLIGATION , WHICH I PROMISE YOU , I WILL FAITHFULLY UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO THANK MY WIFE , CINDY , THE BEST CAMPAIGNER IN THE FAMILY , AND MY DAUGHTERS MEGHAN AND SIDNEY , WHO ARE WITH US TONIGHT , AS WELL AS MY SON , DOUG , AND OUR CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT BE HERE , AND OF COURSE , MY DEAR MOTHER , ROBERTA MCCAIN . IT IS OBVIOUS TO ME , AND TO ALL WHO KNOW ME , THAT WE WOULD NOT BE WHERE WE ARE TONIGHT , BUT FOR YOUR LOVE , ENCOURAGEMENT AND FAITH IN ME . IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , I HAVE TRIED AS BEST I COULD , TO TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH ABOUT THE CHALLENGES FACING OUR COUNTRY , AND HOW I INTEND TO ADDRESS THEM . AS I HAVE SAID BEFORE , I KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I MUST EARN YOUR RESPECT . AND THE ONLY WAY I KNOW HOW TO DO THAT IS BY BEING HONEST WITH YOU . I HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN , AND TO PUT MY TRUST IN YOUR WILLINGNESS TO GIVE ME YOUR FAIR CONSIDERATION . SO FAR , IT SEEMS TO BE WORKING OUT JUST FINE . I AM AWARE THAT FOR THE LAST UNKNOWNWORD YEARS , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA PRIMARY HAS BEEN THE NOMINEE OF OUR PARTY . WE HAVE A WAYS TO GO , OF COURSE . THERE ARE SOME TOUGH CONTESTS AHEAD , STARTING TOMORROW IN THE STATE OF FLORIDA . BUT , MY FRIENDS , WE ARE WELL ON OUR WAY TONIGHT . AND I FEEL VERY GOOD ABOUT OUR CHANCES . AS PLEASED AS WE ARE THAT WE HAVE A REASON TO CELEBRATE TONIGHT , I KNOW THAT I MUST KEEP FOREMOST IN MY MIND THAT I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO BE SOMEBODY , BUT TO DO SOMETHING . I AM RUNNING TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND PROUD . I AM RUNNING TO RESTORE THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I AM RUNNING SO THAT OUR CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN WILL HAVE EVEN GREATER OPPORTUNITIES THAN THE ONES WE WERE BLESSED WITH . I AM RUNNING SO THAT EVERY PERSON IN THIS COUNTRY , NOW AND IN GENERATIONS TO COME , WILL KNOW THE SAME , SUBLIME HONOR THAT HAS BEEN THE TREASURE OF MY LIFE : TO BE PROUD TO BE AN AMERICAN . I SEEK THE NOMINATION OF OUR PARTY , BECAUSE I AM AS CONFIDENT TODAY AS I WAS WHEN I FIRST ENTERED PUBLIC LIFE AS A FOOT SOLDIER IN THE REAGAN REVOLUTION THAT THE PRINCIPLES OF THE REPUBLICAN PARTY -- OUR CONFIDENCE IN THE GOOD SENSE AND RESOURCEFULNESS OF FREE PEOPLE -- ARE ALWAYS IN AMERICA'S BEST INTERESTS . IN WAR AND PEACE , IN GOOD TIMES AND CHALLENGING ONES , WE HAVE ALWAYS KNOWN THAT THE FIRST RESPONSIBILITY OF GOVERNMENT IT TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE FROM ITS ENEMIES , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FREE OF A HEAVY HANDED GOVERNMENT THAT SPENDS TOO MUCH OF THEIR MONEY , AND TRIES TO DO FOR THEM WHAT THEY ARE BETTER ABLE TO DO FOR THEMSELVES . WE WANT GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB ; TO DO IT BETTER AND TO DO IT WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY ; TO DEFEND OUR NATION'S SECURITY WISELY AND EFFECTIVELY , BECAUSE THE COST OF OUR DEFENSE IS SO DEAR TO US ; TO RESPECT OUR VALUES BECAUSE THEY ARE THE TRUE SOURCE OF OUR STRENGTH ; TO ENFORCE T HE RULE OF LAW THAT IS FIRST DEFENSE OF FREEDOM ; TO KEEP THE PROMISES IT MAKES TO US AND NOT MAKE PROMISES IT WILL NOT KEEP . WE BELIEVE GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO ONLY THOSE THINGS WE CANNOT DO UNKNOWNWORD , AND THEN GET OUT OF THE WAY SO THAT THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD , INGENIOUS , AND ENTERPRISING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD CAN DO WHAT THEY HAVE ALWAYS DONE , BUILD AN EVEN GREATER COUNTRY THAN THE ONE THEY INHERITED . MY FRIENDS , I KNOW WE ARE FACING CHALLENGING ECONOMIC TIMES , AND WE MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE CONCERNS OF AMERICANS WHO FEAR THEY ARE BEING LEFT BEHIND IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . BUT NOTHING IS INEVITABLE IN OUR COUNTRY . WE ARE THE CAPTAINS OF OUR FATE . WE CAN OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE AS LONG AS WE KEEP OUR COURAGE , AND STAND BY OUR DEFENSE OF FREE MARKETS , LOW TAXES , AND SMALL GOVERNMENT THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST LAND OF OPPORTUNITY IN THE WORLD . I HAVE SERVED OUR COUNTRY ALL MY ADULT LIFE , AND I AM PREPARED FOR THE HIGH OFFICE I SEEK . I ASKED SOUTH CAROLINIANS TO HELP GIVE ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SERVE THE COUNTRY I LOVE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER . YOU HAVE DONE THAT , AND I WILL NEVER FORGET IT . I PROMISE YOU I WILL ALWAYS PUT AMERICA -- HER STRENGTH , HER IDEALS , HER FUTURE -- BEFORE EVERY OTHER CONSIDERATION . THANK YOU , SOUTH CAROLINA , FOR YOUR TRUST . I WILL NOT LET YOU DOWN , SO HELP ME GOD . GOOD NIGHT AND GOD BLESS YOU AS YOU HAVE BLESSED ME .
RED	THANK YOU . RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT "FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS . IT IS THE CONTINUING REVOLUTION OF THE MARKETPLACE . IT IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE SHORTCOMINGS AND SEEK SOLUTIONS ." WE ARE BLESSED BY FREEDOM , BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING IT IN EVERY REALM IS A MESSAGE THAT POLITICIANS DESPERATELY NEED TO HEAR TODAY . UNFORTUNATELY , WE FIND OURSELVES AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S . ECONOMY IS GROWING MORE SLOWLY THAN ANYONE WOULD LIKE . AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE , CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN ARE EVEN TOUGHER , WITH THE STATE SUFFERING THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR II . TOUGH TIMES CAN BREED FEAR , AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING THOSE FEARS TO PUSH AN AGENDA THAT IS TIRED , DANGEROUS , AND WILL ROB US OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM . ONCE AGAIN , THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE OUR CHOICES FOR US -- NOT RESPECT OUR DREAMS , AND TRUST OUR DECISIONS ON HOW BEST TO SEIZE OUR OPPORTUNITIES . UNEMPLOYMENT IS FIVE PERCENT NATIONWIDE , BUT OVER SEVEN PERCENT IN MICHIGAN . TEN PERCENT OF MICHIGAN'S JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED THIS DECADE AND 50,000 PEOPLE LEFT THE STATE IN THE PAST YEAR . MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS ARE ROOTED IN FAILED GOVERNMENT POLICIES . HEAVY REGULATION , TOO MUCH GOVERNMENT SPENDING AND TAXES , AND A HIGH COST OF DOING BUSINESS HAS HURT IT UNKNOWNWORD . MICHIGAN RANKS 49TH AMONG STATES IN ITS CORPORATE TAX CLIMATE , 45TH IN ITS UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE TAX CLIMATE AND 25TH IN PROPERTY TAXES . THE WORST THING THAT GOVERNMENT COULD DO IN THIS ENVIRONMENT IS RAISE TAXES . AND YET THAT IS WHAT HAPPENED HERE . HIGHER TAXES DISCOURAGE SMALL BUSINESSES AND ENTREPRENEURS , INHIBIT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND SLOW LONG-TERM GROWTH . AT A TIME WHEN IT CAN BE HARD FOR FAMILIES TO WEATHER TOUGH ECONOMIC TIMES , THE GOVERNMENT SHOULD NOT MAKE IT HARDER . WE SHOULD CUT TAXES RIGHT NOW ON THE MIDDLE CLASS BY ELIMINATING THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX , WHICH NO LONGER TAXES JUST THE RICH . IT TAXES 25 MILLION MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES , TAKING FROM THEM NEARLY $2,200 PER FAMILY . MY MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUT IS EXACTLY WHAT THE SLUGGISH U.S . ECONOMY NEEDS . IT WOULD LOWER UNKNOWNWORD TAX RATES , RAISE ECONOMIC GROWTH IMMEDIATELY AND OVER THE LONGER TERM , AND OVER THE NEXT FIVE YEARS LEAD TO AN ADDITIONAL $2,000 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN AMERICA . IT IS WHAT THE WALL STREET JOURNAL WOULD CALL "THE RIGHT STIMULUS ." I WON'T LET THE DEMOCRATS ROLL BACK THE BUSH TAX CUTS . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD PROTECT THE AMERICAN FAMILY AGAINST TAX INCREASES BY REQUIRING A THREE-FIFTHS MAJORITY IN CONGRESS TO RAISE TAXES . BUT I WILL CUT MIDDLE CLASS TAXES AND KEEP THEM LOW THE RIGHT WAY -- BY ALSO CUTTING SPENDING SO WE DON'T ADD TO THE DEBT WE LEAVE TO OUR CHILDREN . EVEN IF WE SUCCEED IN KEEPING TAXES LOW , MICHIGAN BUSINESSES -- LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES , SMALL BUSINESS , AND ENTREPRENEURS ALIKE -- FACE A TSUNAMI OF RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS . RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE A THREAT TO OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS , AMERICAN FAMILIES ' BUDGETS , OUR GOVERNMENT'S SOLVENCY , AND THE PROFITABILITY OF AMERICAN BUSINESS . WE MUST REIN IN THE GROWING COST OF CARE IF WE ARE TO COMPETE GLOBALLY . MY PLAN PUTS MONEY IN THE HANDS OF FAMILIES -- A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR A FAMILY AND OPENS UP GREATER COMPETITION AND INNOVATION SO THAT EVERYONE -- HOSPITALS , INSURANCE COMPANIES , DOCTORS , DRUG COMPANIES -- IS ACCOUNTABLE TO THE AMERICAN FAMILY . THE WALL STREET JOURNAL CALLED IT "SUPPLY SIDE MEDICINE " FOR AMERICAN HEALTH CARE . IT WILL LOWER COSTS , MAINTAIN QUALITY , AND END THE FRUSTRATION OF AMERICAN FAMILIES . HEALTH CARE IN THE UNITED STATES SUFFERS FROM TOO MUCH REGULATION . RONALD REAGAN SHOWED US 25 YEARS AGO THE POWER OF DEREGULATION TO BUILD PROSPERITY . MICHIGAN -- AND THE UNITED STATES -- NEEDS DEREGULATION , FREEDOM , INNOVATION , AND PRIVATE CONTROL OF MONEY -- ESPECIALLY IN HEALTH CARE REFORM . MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS GOT WORSE LAST YEAR WHEN THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEARLY SHUT DOWN , AND DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES NECESSARY TO FOCUS SPENDING ON GENUINE PRIORITIES . IT'S YET ANOTHER REASON WHY THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE TRUST OF TAXPAYERS THAT THE GOVERNMENT WILL SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY WISELY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . WHEN CONGRESS SENDS A PORK-LADEN SPENDING BILL TO MY DESK , I WILL VETO IT . CONGRESS JUST PASSED ANOTHER HUGE , PORK-FILLED SPENDING BILL . THE DEMOCRATS ALLOWED LESS THAN A DAY TO READ ALL UNKNOWNWORD PAGES AND STUFFED IT WITH NEARLY 10,000 EARMARKS COSTING ABOUT $10 BILLION DOLLARS . I WOULD VETO THAT BILL . WE NEED TO SEND WASHINGTON A MESSAGE : NO EARMARKS . NOT 10,000 . NOT 1 . ZERO . I WILL ENFORCE FISCAL DISCIPLINE AND RETURN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY TO ITS PRINCIPLE THAT GOVERNMENT SHOULD DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB , AND SHOULD DO IT WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY . WHEN THE GOVERNMENT'S HOUSE IS NOT IN ORDER , IT UNKNOWNWORD NEEDLESS UNCERTAINTY TO THE ECONOMY , RAISING INTEREST RATES , AND ULTIMATELY HARMING CONSUMERS AND FAMILIES . WHEN INTEREST RATES ARE LOW , INDIVIDUALS CAN AFFORD HOME LOANS , BUY NEW CARS , PAY OFF THEIR CREDIT CARD DEBTS MORE EASILY , AND MORE JOBS ARE CREATED . TOUGH TIMES BREED FEAR , MY FRIENDS , AND WE ARE HEARING THE FEAR-MONGERS SAY THAT MICHIGAN CANNOT COMPETE ON GLOBAL MARKETS . THOSE VOICES IGNORE THE LESSON OF HISTORY THAT ANY NATION THAT TURNS TO PROTECTIONISM HURTS ITSELF IN THE END . WE NEED TO CONTINUE TO LOWER BARRIERS TO TRADE BECAUSE NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S CUSTOMERS LIVE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES . WE NEED TO HAVE COMPETITIVE MANUFACTURING THROUGH LOWER HEALTH CARE COSTS , LOWER TAXES , AND OPENING NEW MARKETS . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS . I WILL MAKE SURE THAT MICHIGAN CAN COMPETE . ALREADY IT EXPORTS $24 BILLION TO CANADA , A CRUCIAL TRADING PARTNER . BETWEEN 2001 AND 2006 , MICHIGAN EVEN INCREASED ITS EXPORTS TO CHINA -- YES , CHINA -- BY OVER UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . BUT WE CAN DO BETTER . I WILL INSIST THAT CHINA UNKNOWNWORD FAIRLY AND THAT THE WTO AGREEMENTS ARE ENFORCED SO THAT THEIR IMPORTS ARE SAFE . IT WOULD BE A MISTAKE TO VIEW ECONOMIC RELATIONS WITH CHINA IN ISOLATION . I AM CONCERNED THAT CHINA THROUGH ITS PIRACY OF US UNKNOWNWORD PROPERTY IS ALSO BUILDING ITSELF INTO A MILITARY SUPERPOWER THAT HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED THE CAPABILITY TO SHOOT DOWN SATELLITES . WE WILL ONLY BE SUCCESSFUL IN GETTING CHINA TO MEET ITS INTERNATIONAL ECONOMIC OBLIGATIONS BY ENGAGING IT ON THE FULL RANGE OF ISSUES INVOLVED IN OUR RELATIONS -- FROM SUPPRESSION OF PERSONAL AND RELIGIOUS FREEDOMS , TO RELATIONS WITH NORTH KOREA AND IRAN , TO ITS RISING INFLUENCE IN AFRICA -- WHICH WILL DETERMINE WHETHER CHINA WILL EMERGE AS A RESPONSIBLE OR IRRESPONSIBLE WORLD POWER . I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE IN THESE AREAS THAT WILL ALSO SERVE TO ENSURE THAT AMERICAN WORKERS -- THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKER IN THE WORLD -- WILL BE EVEN MORE COMPETITIVE . GLOBALIZATION IS HERE TO STAY . THAT IS NOT SOMETHING TO FEAR . IT IS AN OPPORTUNITY TO BE SEIZED . BUT GLOBALIZATION WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BENEFIT EVERY AMERICAN . CHANGE IS HARD , AND WHILE MOST OF US GAIN , SOME INDUSTRIES , COMPANIES AND WORKERS ARE FORCED TO STRUGGLE WITH VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES . IT WASN'T GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SPEND MILLIONS TO SAVE BUGGY WHIP FACTORIES AND HABERDASHERS WHEN CARS REPLACED CARRIAGES AND MEN STOPPED WEARING HATS . BUT IT IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO HELP WORKERS GET THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED FOR THE NEW JOBS THAT WILL BE CREATED BY NEW BUSINESSES IN THIS NEW CENTURY . RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A DOZEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS FOR DISPLACED WORKERS AND OTHERS OUT OF A JOB . OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST WORKERS THROUGH A FEW TOUGH MONTHS DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN UNTIL THEIR OLD JOBS CAME BACK . WE NEED PROGRAMS THAT WORK IN THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY . IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK WITH CONGRESS AND THE STATES TO OVERHAUL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND MAKE IT A PROGRAM FOR RETRAINING , RELOCATING AND ASSISTING WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST A JOB THAT'S NOT COMING BACK TO FIND A JOB THAT WON'T GO AWAY . WE NEED TO BETTER CONNECT TRAINING WITH BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND NEEDS . AS I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AND EDUCATION EXPERTS I HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING THE RIGHT SKILLS TO WORKERS AND THE RIGHT WORKERS FOR FIRMS . WE SHOULD TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF THIS RECORD OF SUCCESS . AND WE CAN TRUST WORKERS TO CHOOSE . WE NEED TO TRANSFORM RIGID TRAINING PROGRAMS TO APPROACHES THAT CAN BE USED TO MEET THE BILLS , PAY FOR TRAINING , AND GET BACK TO WORK . OLDER WORKERS CAN USE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND WORK ETHIC TO ADAPT TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT JOB , BUT OFTEN THE STARTING PAY OF THE NEXT JOB DOESN'T MEASURE UP . WE SHOULD GIVE THESE DISPLACED WORKERS WHO MOVE TO A NEW JOB A FEW YEARS OF SUPPLEMENT TO THEIR EARNINGS SO THAT THE IMPACT OF THEIR ECONOMIC DISLOCATION IS NOT SO SEVERE . THEY WILL BE LESS RESISTANT TO TAKING A LOWER PAYING JOB AND WE WILL ALL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEIR EXPERIENCE BACK ON THE JOB . I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN SOMEONE'S VOTE , I HAVE TO WIN THEIR RESPECT . AND TO DO THAT I HAVE TO BE HONEST WITH YOU . SO HERE'S A LITTLE STRAIGHT TALK I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF MICHIGAN WILL UNDERSTAND . SOME JOBS THAT HAVE LEFT MICHIGAN ARE NOT COMING BACK . AND THE ANSWER TO THAT ISN'T TO RAISE FALSE HOPES THAT SOMEHOW WE CAN BRING BACK LOST JOBS BUT TO CREATE NEW ONES . OUR COUNTRY'S DANGEROUS DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL THREATENS BOTH OUR NATIONAL SECURITY AND OUR ENVIRONMENT , NOT TO MENTION THE TERRIBLY INJURIOUS EFFECT HIGH OIL PRICES HAS ON OUR ECONOMY . THE TRANSFER OF HUNDREDS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS OF AMERICAN WEALTH TO THE MIDDLE EAST HELPS SUSTAIN THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH TERRORISTS PREY . SOME OF THE MOST OIL-RICH NATIONS ARE THE MOST STAGNANT SOCIETIES ON EARTH . AS LONG AS PETRO-DOLLARS FLOW FREELY TO THEM THOSE REGIMES HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO OPEN THEIR POLITICS AND ECONOMIES SO THAT ALL THEIR PEOPLE MAY BENEFIT FROM THEIR COUNTRIES ' NATURAL WEALTH . THE MIDDLE EAST'S EXAMPLE IS SPREADING TO OUR OWN HEMISPHERE . VENEZUELA'S HUGO CHAVEZ IS USING HIS COUNTRY'S OIL REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A DICTATORSHIP , BULLY HIS NEIGHBORS AND SUCCEED CASTRO AS LATIN AMERICA'S LEADING ANTAGONIST OF THE UNITED STATES . IN RUSSIA , VLADIMIR PUTIN IS USING OIL AS A GEOPOLITICAL WEAPON AND THE SALES PROCEEDS TO FUND A ROLLBACK OF DEMOC RACY . AT THE SAME TIME THAT WE MAKE AMERICA SAFER , WE CAN MEET OUR OBLIGATION TO FUTURE GENERATIONS . I BELIEVE THAT WE MUST ADDRESS CLIMATE CHANGE NOW JUST AS REPUBLICAN TEDDY ROOSEVELT HAD THE VISION A CENTURY AGO TO PRESERVE MANY OF THE NATURAL UNKNOWNWORD OUR FAMILIES ENJOY TODAY . AMERICA REMAINS THE WORLD'S INNOVATOR ; WE CAN AND SHOULD BE AT THE FOREFRONT OF GREEN TECHNOLOGY . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS , AND THIS IS AN OPPORTUNITY FOR AMERICAN INGENUITY AND UNKNOWNWORD TO KEEP US ON THE CUTTING EDGE . WE CAN'T DO THAT WITHOUT MICHIGAN , AND THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY THAT HAS BEEN THE ENGINE OF YOUR PROSPERITY . HASTENING THE DEVELOPMENT OF RENEWABLE ENERGY SOURCES , INCLUDING NUCLEAR POWER , IS OBVIOUSLY A CRITICALLY IMPORTANT PART OF THE SOLUTION . BUT NO MORE SO THAN MANUFACTURING CARS THAT RUN ON SOMETHING OTHER THAN GASOLINE . THE AUTOMOBILE INDUSTRY IS ALREADY MAKING REAL PROGRESS TOWARD THIS END , BUT WE MUST ACCELERATE EFFORTS TO ACHIEVE THE NECESSARY TECHNOLOGICAL BREAKTHROUGHS THAT WILL REDUCE OUR CONSUMPTION OF GASOLINE -- HYBRID CARS AND HYDROGEN ENGINES AND LONG LASTING BATTERIES AND OTHER PROMISING ADVANCES . MICHIGAN HAS A BRIGHT FUTURE ; BUT IT WILL NOT BE REACHED BY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD EATE THE PAST . MY FRIENDS , AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL TO COME . YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME THAT OUR PROBLEMS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE . AMERICANS HAVE NEVER MET A CHALLENGE WE COULDN'T OVERCOME WITH HARD WORK , INGENUITY AND DARING . WE CAN BREAK OUR DANGEROUS DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL ; MAKE OUR COUNTRY AND THE WORLD SAFER ; OUR ENVIRONMENT CLEANER AND CREATE NEW JOBS FOR THE EXPERIENCED , CAPABLE AND PRODUCTIVE WORKERS OF MICHIGAN . LET IT BEGIN NOW . LET IT BEGIN IN MICHIGAN . WE STAND ON THE THRESHOLD OF ANOTHER CENTURY OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE ANOTHER CHAPTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS . THOSE OF US PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY NEED ONLY BE MINDFUL OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE US GREAT , HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND BY OUR PRINCIPLES , HONOR OUR PUBLIC TRUST , AND KEEP OUR PROMISES TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S INTERESTS BEFORE OUR OWN . THANK YOU .
RED	THANK YOU . MY FRIENDS , I AM PAST THE AGE WHEN I CAN CLAIM THE UNKNOWNWORD , "KID ," NO MATTER WHAT UNKNOWNWORD PRECEDES IT . BUT TONIGHT WE SURE SHOWED THEM WHAT A COMEBACK LOOKS LIKE . WHEN THE PUNDITS DECLARED US FINISHED , I TOLD THEM , "I'M GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE , WHERE THE VOTERS DON'T LET YOU MAKE THEIR DECISION FOR THEM ." AND WHEN THEY ASKED , "HOW ARE YOU GOING TO DO IT ? YOU'RE DOWN IN THE POLLS . YOU DON'T HAVE THE MONEY ." I ANSWERED , "I'M GOING TO NEW HAMPSHIRE , AND I'M GOING TO TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH ." WE CAME BACK HERE TO THIS WONDERFUL STATE WE'VE COME TO TRUST AND LOVE . AND WE HAD JUST ONE STRATEGY : TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE . I DIDN'T JUST TELL YOU WHAT THE POLLS SAID YOU WANTED TO HEAR . I DIDN'T TELL YOU WHAT I KNEW TO BE FALSE . I DIDN'T TRY TO SPIN YOU . I JUST TALKED TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE . I TALKED ABOUT THE COUNTRY WE LOVE ; THE MANY CHALLENGES WE FACE TOGETHER ; AND THE GREAT PROMISE THAT IS OURS TO ACHIEVE ; THE WORK THAT AWAITS US IN THIS HOUR , ON OUR WATCH : TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY FROM ITS ENEMIES ; TO ADVANCE THE IDEALS THAT ARE OUR GREATEST STRENGTH ; TO INCREASE THE PROSPERITY AND OPPORTUNITIES OF ALL AMERICANS AND TO MAKE IN OUR TIME , AS EACH PRECEDING AMERICAN GENERATION HAS , ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD THAN THE ONE WE INHERITED . I TALKED TO THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE . I REASONED WITH YOU . I LISTENED TO YOU . I ANSWERED YOU . SOMETIMES , I ARGUED WITH YOU . BUT I ALWAYS TOLD YOU THE TRUTH , AS BEST AS I CAN SEE THE TRUTH . AND YOU DID ME THE GREAT HONOR OF LISTENING . THANK YOU , NEW HAMPSHIRE , FROM THE BOTTOM MY HEART . I AM GRATEFUL AND HUMBLED AND MORE CERTAIN THAN EVER THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I MUST WIN YOUR RESPECT . AND I MUST DO THAT BY BEING HONEST WITH YOU , AND THEN PUT MY TRUST IN YOUR FAIRNESS AND GOOD JUDGMENT . TONIGHT , WE HAVE TAKEN A STEP , BUT ONLY THE FIRST STEP TOWARD REPAIRING THE BROKEN POLITICS OF THE PAST AND RESTORING THE TRUST OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . THE PEOPLE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE HAVE TOLD US AGAIN THAT THEY DO NOT SEND US TO WASHINGTON TO SERVE OUR SELF-INTEREST , BUT TO SERVE THEIRS . THEY DON'T SEND US TO FIGHT EACH OTHER FOR OUR OWN POLITICAL AMBITIONS ; BUT TO FIGHT TOGETHER OUR REAL ENEMIES . THEY DON'T SEND US TO WASHINGTON TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR EGOS ; BUT TO HELP THEM KEEP THIS BEAUTIFUL , BOUNTIFUL , BLESSED COUNTRY SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND PROUD . THEY DON'T SEND US TO WASHINGTON TO TAKE MORE OF THEIR MONEY , AND WASTE IT ON THINGS THAT ADD NOT AN OUNCE TO AMERICA'S STRENGTH AND PROSPERITY ; THAT DON'T HELP A SINGLE FAMILY REALIZE THE DREAMS WE ALL DREAM FOR OUR CHILDREN ; THAT DON'T HELP A SINGLE DISPLACED WORKER FIND A NEW JOB , AND THE SECURITY AND DIGNITY IT ASSURES THEM ; THAT WON'T KEEP THE PROMISE WE MAKE TO YOUNG WORKERS THAT THE RETIREMENT THEY HAVE BEGUN TO INVEST IN , WILL BE THERE FOR THEM WHEN THEY NEED IT . THEY DON'T SEND US TO WASHINGTON TO DO THEIR JOB , BUT TO DO OURS . MY FRIENDS , I DIDN'T GO TO WASHINGTON TO GO ALONG , TO GET ALONG OR TO PLAY IT SAFE TO SERVE MY OWN INTERESTS . I WENT THERE TO SERVE MY COUNTRY . AND THAT , MY FRIENDS , IS JUST WHAT I INTEND TO DO IF I AM SO PRIVILEGED TO BE ELECTED YOUR PRESIDENT . I SEEK THE NOMINATION OF A PARTY THAT BELIEVES IN THE STRENGTH , INDUSTRY , AND GOODNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WE DON'T BELIEVE THAT GOVERNMENT HAS ALL THE ANSWERS , BUT THAT IT SHOULD RESPECT THE RIGHTS , PROPERTY AND OPPORTUNITIES OF THE PEOPLE TO WHOM WE ARE ACCOUNTABLE . WE DON'T BELIEVE IN GROWING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT TO MAKE IT EASIER TO SERVE OUR OWN AMBITIONS . BUT WHAT GOVERNMENT IS EXPECTED TO DO , IT MUST DO WITH COMPETENCE , RESOLVE AND WISDOM . IN RECENT YEARS , WE HAVE LOST THE TRUST OF THE PEOPLE , WHO SHARE OUR PRINCIPLES , BUT DOUBT OUR OWN ALLEGIANCE TO THEM . I SEEK THE NOMINATION OF OUR PARTY TO RESTORE THAT TRUST ; TO RETURN OUR PARTY TO THE PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE NEVER FAILED AMERICANS : THE PARTY OF FISCAL DISCIPLINE , LOW TAXES ; ENDURING VALUES ; A STRONG AND CAPABLE DEFENSE ; THAT ENCOURAGES THE ENTERPRISE AND INGENUITY OF INDIVIDUALS , BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES , WHO KNOW BEST HOW TO ADVANCE AMERICA'S ECONOMY , AND SECURE THE DREAMS THAT HAVE MADE US THE GREATEST NATION IN HISTORY . THE WORK THAT WE FACE IN OUR TIME IS GREAT , BUT OUR OPPORTUNITIES GREATER STILL . IN A TIME OF WAR , AND THE TERRIBLE SACRIFICES IT ENTAILS , THE PROMISE OF A BETTER FUTURE IS NOT ALWAYS CLEAR . BUT I PROMISE YOU , MY FRIENDS , WE FACE NO ENEMY , NO MATTER HOW CRUEL ; AND NO CHALLENGE , NO MATTER HOW DAUNTING , GREATER THAN THE COURAGE , PATRIOTISM AND DETERMINATION OF AMERICANS . WE ARE THE MAKERS OF HISTORY , NOT ITS VICTIMS . AND AS WE CONFRONT THIS ENEMY , THE PEOPLE PRIVILEGED TO SERVE IN PUBLIC OFFICE SHOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD OUR MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY TO DEFEAT THEM BECAUSE WE ARE MORE CONCERNED WITH PERSONAL OR PARTISAN AMBITION . WHATEVER THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN US , SO MUCH MORE SHOULD UNITE US . AND NOTHING SHOULD UNITE US MORE CLOSELY THAN THE IMPERATIVE OF DEFEATING AN ENEMY WHO DESPISES US , OUR VALUES AND MODERNITY ITSELF . WE MUST ALL PULL TOGETHER IN THIS CRITICAL HOUR AND PROCLAIM THAT THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD WILL NOT BE DETERMINED BY THIS UNPARDONABLE FOE , BUT BY THE ASPIRATIONS , IDEALS , FAITH AND COURAGE OF FREE PEOPLE . IN THIS GREAT , HISTORIC TASK , WE WILL NEVER SURRENDER . THEY WILL . THE RESULTS OF THE OTHER PARTY'S PRIMARY IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME , BUT I WANT TO CONGRATULATE ALL THE CAMPAIGNS IN BOTH PARTIES . I UNKNOWNWORD THE SUPPORTERS OF ALL THE CANDIDATES WHO WORKED SO HARD TO ACHIEVE A SUCCESS TONIGHT AND WHO BELIEVE SO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE PROMISE OF THEIR CANDIDATE . AND I WANT TO ASSURE THEM THAT THOUGH I DID NOT HAVE THEIR SUPPORT , AND THOUGH WE MAY DISAGREE FROM TIME TO TIME ON HOW BEST TO ADVANCE AMERICA'S INTERESTS AND IDEALS , THEY HAVE MY GENUINE RESPECT . FOR THEY HAVE WORKED FOR A CAUSE THEY BELIEVE IS GOOD FOR THE COUNTRY WE ALL LOVE , A CAUSE GREATER THAN THEIR SELF-INTEREST . I LEARNED LONG AGO THAT SERVING ONLY ONESELF IS A PETTY AND UNSATISFYING AMBITION . BUT SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST AND YOU WILL KNOW A HAPPINESS FAR MORE SUBLIME THAN THE UNKNOWNWORD PLEASURE OF FAME AND FORTUNE . FOR ME THAT GREATER CAUSE HAS ALWAYS BEEN MY COUNTRY , WHICH I HAVE SERVED IMPERFECTLY FOR MANY YEARS , BUT HAVE LOVED WITHOUT ANY RESERVATION EVERY DAY OF MY LIFE . AND HOWEVER THIS CAMPAIGN TURNS OUT -- AND I AM MORE CONFIDENT TONIGHT THAT IT WILL TURN OUT MUCH BETTER THAN ONCE EXPECTED -- I AM GRATEFUL BEYOND EXPRESSION FOR THE PROSPECT THAT I MIGHT SERVE HER A LITTLE WHILE LONGER . THAT GRATITUDE IMPOSES ON ME THE RESPONSIBILITY TO DO NOTHING IN THIS CAMPAIGN THAT WOULD MAKE OUR COUNTRY'S PROBLEMS HARDER TO SOLVE OR THAT WOULD CAUSE AMERICANS TO DESPAIR THAT A CANDIDATE FOR THE HIGHEST OFFICE IN THE LAND WOULD THINK SO LITTLE OF THE HONOR THAT HE WOULD PUT HIS OWN INTERESTS BEFORE THEIRS . I TAKE THAT RESPONSIBILITY AS MY MOST SOLEMN TRUST . SO , MY FRIENDS , WE CELEBRATE ONE VICTORY TONIGHT AND LEAVE FOR MICHIGAN TOMORROW TO WIN ANOTHER . BUT LET US REMEMBER THAT OUR PURPOSE IS NOT OURS ALONE ; OUR SUCCESS IS NOT AN END IN ITSELF . AMERICA IS OUR CAUSE -- YESTERDAY , TODAY , AND TOMORROW . HER GREATNESS IS OUR HOPE ; HER STRENGTH IS OUR PROTECTION ; HER IDEALS OUR GREATEST TREASURE ; HER PROSPERITY THE PROMISE WE KEEP TO OUR CHILDREN ; HER GOODNESS THE HOPE OF MANKIND . THAT IS THE CAUSE OF OUR CAMPAIGN AND THE PLATFORM OF MY PARTY , AND I WILL STAY TRUE TO IT SO HELP ME GOD . THANK YOU , NEW HAMPSHIRE . THANK YOU , MY FRIENDS , AND GOD BLESS YOU AS YOU HAVE BLESSED ME . ENJOY THIS . YOU HAVE EARNED IT MORE THAN ME . TOMORROW , WE BEGIN AGAIN .
RED	THANK YOU . I APPRECIATE THE CHANCE TO BE HERE AT THE CENTER FOR HYDROGEN RESEARCH AND TO TALK WITH YOU ABOUT A GREAT AND URGENT CHALLENGE - BREAKING OUR NATION'S CRITICAL DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN SOURCES OF OIL , AND MAKING AMERICA SAFER , STRONGER AND MORE PROSPEROUS BY MODERNIZING THE WAY WE GENERATE AND EMPLOY ENERGY . SOUTH CAROLINA HAS BEEN A LEADER IN MAKING AMERICA MORE ENERGY SECURE , PARTICULARLY IN THE AREA OF NUCLEAR POWER . FOR OVER FIFTY YEARS THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE WAS CRITICAL TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY . IN THE FUTURE THIS SITE WILL BE AN INTEGRAL PART OF OUR MOVE TOWARD ENERGY SECURITY . OIL IS OFTEN CALLED THE LIFEBLOOD OF OUR ECONOMY - THE INDISPENSABLE COMMODITY THAT KEEPS COMMERCE HUMMING AND AMERICA ON THE MOVE . BUT , IN TODAY'S WORLD , OUR DEPENDENCY ON FOREIGN OIL AND THE WAY WE USE HYDROCARBONS IS A MAJOR STRATEGIC VULNERABILITY , A THREAT TO OUR SECURITY , OUR ECONOMY AND THE WELL BEING OF OUR PLANET . GREAT NATIONS DON'T LEAVE THE UNKNOWNWORD ' OF THEIR ECONOMY IN THE HANDS OF FOREIGN CARTELS OR BET THEIR FUTURE ON A COMMODITY LOCATED IN COUNTRIES WHERE AUTHORITARIANS REPRESS THEIR PEOPLE AND TERRORISTS FIND THEIR MAIN SUPPORT . TERRORISTS UNDERSTAND THE SERIOUSNESS OF OUR VULNERABILITY . AL QAEDA PLANS FOR ATTACKS ON OIL FACILITIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST TO DESTROY THE AMERICAN ECONOMY . A LITTLE OVER A YEAR AGO , A SUICIDE ATTACK AT A MAJOR SAUDI ARABIAN OIL REFINERY CAME CLOSE TO UNKNOWNWORD ITS TARGET . WE'RE ONE SUCCESSFUL ATTACK AWAY FROM AN ECONOMIC CRISIS . THE FLOW OF OIL HAS MANY CHOKEPOINTS - PIPELINES , UNKNOWNWORD , TRANSIT ROUTES , AND TERMINALS ; MOST OF THEM OUTSIDE OUR JURISDICTION AND CONTROL . OUR ENEMIES UNDERSTAND THE EFFECTS ON AMERICA OF A SIGNIFICANT DISRUPTION IN SUPPLY - A CRIPPLED TRANSPORTATION SYSTEM , GASOLINE TOO EXPENSIVE FOR MANY AMERICANS TO PURCHASE , BUSINESSES CLOSED . AL QAEDA MUST REVEL IN THE IRONY THAT AMERICA IS EFFECTIVELY HELPING TO FUND BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR THEY CAUSED . AS WE SACRIFICE BLOOD AND TREASURE , SOME OF OUR GAS DOLLARS FLOW TO THE FANATICS WHO BUILD THE BOMBS , UNKNOWNWORD THE PLOTS , AND CARRY OUT ATTACKS ON OUR SOLDIERS AND CITIZENS . IRAN MADE OVER UNKNOWNWORD BILLION FROM OIL SALES IN 2005 , AND IT IS THE NUMBER ONE STATE SPONSOR OF TERRORISM . THE TRANSFER OF AMERICAN WEALTH TO THE MIDDLE EAST HELPS SUSTAIN THE CONDITIONS ON WHICH TERRORISTS PREY . SOME OF THE MOST OIL-RICH NATIONS ARE THE MOST STAGNANT SOCIETIES ON EARTH . AS LONG AS PETRO-DOLLARS FLOW FREELY TO THEM THOSE REGIMES HAVE LITTLE INCENTIVE TO OPEN THEIR POLITICS AND ECONOMIES SO THAT ALL THEIR PEOPLE MAY BENEFIT FROM THEIR COUNTRIES ' NATURAL WEALTH . THE MIDDLE EAST'S EXAMPLE IS SPREADING TO OUR OWN HEMISPHERE . VENEZUELA'S HUGO CHAVEZ IS USING HIS COUNTRY'S OIL REVENUES TO ESTABLISH A DICTATORSHIP , BULLY HIS NEIGHBORS AND SUCCEED CASTRO AS LATIN AMERICA'S LEADING ANTAGONIST OF THE UNITED STATES . IN RUSSIA , VLADIMIR PUTIN IS USING OIL AS A GEOPOLITICAL WEAPON AND THE SALES PROCEEDS TO FUND A ROLLBACK OF DEMOCRACY . THE POLITICS OF OIL IMPEDE THE GLOBAL PROGRESS OF OUR VALUES , AND RESTRAINS GOVERNMENTS FROM ACTING ON THE MOST BASIC IMPULSES OF HUMAN DECENCY . THERE IS ONLY ONE REASON CHINA HAS OPPOSED SANCTIONS TO PRESSURE SUDAN TO STOP THE KILLING IN DARFUR : CHINA NEEDS SUDAN'S OIL . WE SHOULD HASTEN THE DAY WHEN AMERICA CAN WIELD ITS POWER AT THE TABLE OF DIPLOMACY IN THE MIDDLE EAST WITH AN UNDERSTANDING THAT WE ARE NOT DEPENDENT ON THEIR OIL . THE BURNING OF OIL AND OTHER FOSSIL FUELS IS CONTRIBUTING TO THE DANGEROUS ACCUMULATION OF GREENHOUSE GASES IN THE EARTH'S ATMOSPHERE , UNKNOWNWORD OUR CLIMATE WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MAJOR SOCIAL , ECONOMIC AND POLITICAL UPHEAVAL . IT IS A SERIOUS AND URGENT ECONOMIC , ENVIRONMENTAL AND NATIONAL SECURITY CHALLENGE . IS IT TOO BIG A CHALLENGE FOR AMERICA TO TACKLE ? NO , IT IS NOT . NO PEOPLE HAVE EVER BEEN BETTER INNOVATORS AND PROBLEM SOLVERS THAN AMERICANS . THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA PROVIDE AN EXAMPLE FOR US TO FOLLOW IN DEVELOPING ENERGY SECURITY . IT IS IN OUR NATIONAL DNA TO SEE CHALLENGES AS OPPORTUNITIES ; TO CONQUER PROBLEMS BEYOND THE EXPECTATION OF AN ADMIRING WORLD . AMERICA , RELYING AS ALWAYS ON THE INDUSTRY AND IMAGINATION OF A FREE PEOPLE , AND THE POWER AND INNOVATION OF FREE MARKETS , IS CAPABLE OF OVERCOMING ANY CHALLENGE FROM WITHIN AND WITHOUT OUR BORDERS . OUR ENEMIES BELIEVE WE'RE TOO WEAK TO OVERCOME OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL . EVEN SOME OF OUR ALLIES THINK WE'RE NO LONGER THE WORLD'S MOST VISIONARY , MOST CAPABLE COUNTRY OR COMMITTED TO THE ADVANCEMENT OF MANKIND . I THINK WE KNOW BETTER THAN THAT . I THINK WE KNOW WHO WE ARE AND WHAT WE CAN DO . NOW , LET'S REMIND THE WORLD . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL PROPOSE A NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY THAT WILL AMOUNT TO A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE FEAR BRED BY OUR RELIANCE ON OIL SHEIKS AND OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE TROUBLED POLITICS OF THE LANDS THEY RULE . WHEN WE REACH THE LIMITS OF MILITARY POWER AND DIPLOMACY TO CONTAIN THE DANGERS OF THAT CAULDRON OF BURNING RESENTMENTS AND EXTREMISM , ENERGY SECURITY IS OUR BEST DEFENSE . WE WON'T ACHIEVE IT TOMORROW , BUT WE MUST ACHIEVE IT IN OUR TIME . THE STRATEGY I PROPOSE WON'T BE ANOTHER GRAB BAG OF HANDOUTS TO THIS OR THAT INDUSTRY AND A FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR LOBBYISTS . IT WILL RELY ON THE GENIUS AND TECHNOLOGICAL UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICAN INDUSTRY AND SCIENCE . GOVERNMENT MUST SET ACHIEVABLE GOALS , BUT THE MARKETS SHOULD BE FREE TO PRODUCE THE MEANS . THOSE MEANS ARE WITHIN OUR REACH . ENERGY EFFICIENCY BY USING IMPROVED TECHNOLOGY AND PRACTICING SENSIBLE UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR HOMES , BUSINESSES AND AUTOMOBILES IS A BIG PART OF THE ANSWER , AND IS SOMETHING WE CAN ACHIEVE RIGHT NOW . FLEXIBLE-FUEL VEHICLES AREN'T FUTURISTIC UNKNOWNWORD IN THE SKY . WE CAN EASILY UNKNOWNWORD SUCH TECHNOLOGY TODAY FOR LESS THAN $100 PER VEHICLE ; AND WE DEVELOP THE INFRASTRUCTURE NECESSARY TO TAKE FULL ADVANTAGE . ALCOHOL FUELS MADE FROM CORN , SUGAR , SWITCH GRASS AND MANY OTHER SOURCES THAT COULD BENEFIT THAT RURAL FARM ECONOMY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND OTHER STATES , FUEL CELLS , BIODIESEL DERIVED FROM WASTE PRODUCTS , NATURAL GAS , AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES ARE ALL PROMISING AND AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES TO OIL . I WON'T SUPPORT SUBSIDIZING EVERY ALTERNATIVE OR TARIFFS THAT RESTRICT THE HEALTHY COMPETITION THAT STIMULATES INNOVATION AND LOWER COSTS . BUT I'LL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND MARKET GROWTH NECESSARY FOR THESE PRODUCTS TO COMPETE , AND LET CONSUMERS CHOOSE THE WINNERS . I'VE NEVER KNOWN AN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR WORTHY OF THE NAME WHO WOULDN'T RATHER COMPETE FOR SALES THAN SUBSIDIES . AMERICA'S ELECTRICITY PRODUCTION IS FOR THE MOST PART PETROLEUM FREE , AND THE EXISTING ELECTRIC POWER GRID HAS THE CAPACITY TO HANDLE THE ADDED DEMAND IMPOSED BY PLUG-IN HYBRID VEHICLES . WE CAN ADD MORE CAPACITY AND IMPROVE ITS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE YEARS AHEAD . I'LL WORK TO PROMOTE REAL PARTNERSHIPS BETWEEN UTILITIES AND AUTOMAKERS TO ACCELERATE THE DEPLOYMENT OF PLUG-IN HYBRIDS . WE HAVE IN USE TODAY A ZERO EMISSION ENERGY THAT COULD PROVIDE ELECTRICITY FOR MILLIONS MORE HOMES AND BUSINESSES THAN IT CURRENTLY DOES . YET IT HAS BEEN OVER TWENTY-FIVE YEARS SINCE A NUCLEAR POWER PLANT HAS BEEN CONSTRUCTED . THE BARRIERS TO NUCLEAR ENERGY ARE POLITICAL NOT TECHNOLOGICAL . WE'VE LET THE FEARS OF THIRTY YEARS AGO , AND AN ENDLESS POLITICAL SQUABBLE OVER THE STORAGE OF NUCLEAR SPENT FUEL MAKE IT VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO BUILD A SINGLE NEW PLANT THAT PRODUCES A FORM OF ENERGY THAT IS SAFE AND NON-POLLUTING . THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE HAS BEEN INSTRUMENTAL IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF NEW REACTOR TECHNOLOGY THAT IS MORE FUEL EFFICIENT AND SAFE . IF FRANCE CAN PRODUCE 80 PERCENT OF ITS ELECTRICITY WITH NUCLEAR POWER , WHY CAN'T WE ? IS FRANCE A MORE SECURE , ADVANCED AND INNOVATIVE COUNTRY THAN WE ARE ? ARE FRANCE'S SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS MORE CAPABLE THAN WE ARE ? I NEED NO ANSWER TO THAT RHETORICAL QUESTION . I KNOW MY COUNTRY WELL ENOUGH TO KNOW OTHERWISE . LET'S PROVIDE FOR SAFE STORAGE OF SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL , AND GIVE HOST STATES OR LOCALITIES A PROPRIETARY INTEREST SO WHEN ADVANCED RECYCLING TECHNOLOGIES TURN USED FUEL INTO A VALUABLE COMMODITY , THE PUBLIC WILL SHARE IN ITS ECONOMIC BENEFITS . THE SAVANNAH RIVER SITE WOULD BE AN IDEAL LOCATION TO DEMONSTRATE THAT RECYCLING SPENT NUCLEAR FUEL IS POSSIBLE IN THE UNITED STATES . OTHER COUNTRIES , SUCH AS FRANCE AND JAPAN , ALREADY RECYCLE SPENT FUEL . WE SHOULD DO THE SAME . AND SOUTH CAROLINA'S UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM REMINDS US THAT THE EXPANSION OF THE USE OF NUCLEAR POWER WILL ENABLE US TO TURN OUR SWORDS INTO PLOWSHARES AND MAKE THE WORLD SAFER THROUGH THE CONVERSION OF WEAPONS GRADE MATERIAL THAT CAN BE USED BY TERRORISTS OR ROGUE NATIONS INTO FUEL FOR UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR REACTORS FOR PEACEFUL USES . THERE IS MUCH WE CAN DO TO INCREASE OUR OWN OIL PRODUCTION IN WAYS THAT PROTECT THE ENVIRONMENT USING ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES , INCLUDING THOSE THAT USE AND BURY CARBON DIOXIDE , TO RECOVER THE OIL BELOW THE WELLS WE HAVE ALREADY DRILLED , AND TAP OIL , NATURAL GAS , AND UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMICALLY WITH MINIMAL ENVIRONMENTAL IMPACT . THE UNITED STATES HAS COAL RESERVES MORE ABUNDANT THAN SAUDI UNKNOWNWORD OIL RESERVES . WE FOUND A WAY TO CUT DOWN ACID RAIN POLLUTANTS FROM BURNING COAL , AND WE CAN FIND A WAY TO USE OUR COAL RESOURCES WITHOUT EMITTING EXCESSIVE GREENHOUSE GASES . WE CAN ALSO FIND WAYS TO USE NEW SOURCES OF POWER LIKE HYDROGEN . MY ENERGY POLICIES WILL RELY ON SETTING GOOD INCENTIVES FOR FIRMS , ENTREPRENEURS , AND HOUSEHOLDS . BUT THEY WILL NOT UNKNOWNWORD THE NEED FOR BASIC RESEARCH TO PROVIDE THE PATHWAY FOR NEW SOURCES OF ENERGY , BETTER MATERIALS , IMPROVED BATTERIES , AND OTHER ADVANCES IN KNOWLEDGE THAT WILL BE CENTRAL TO RISING TO THIS GREAT CHALLENGE . THE RESEARCH BEING PERFORMED AT CLEMSON UNIVERSITY AND THE INTERNATIONAL CENTER FOR AUTOMOTIVE RESEARCH IS UNLOCKING THE POSSIBILITIES FOR HYDROGEN FUELED AUTOMOBILES . AND RESEARCH AT THE UNIVERSITY OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND THE SAVANNAH RIVER NATIONAL LABORATORY IS ADVANCING THE POTENTIAL FOR OTHER HYDROGEN TECHNOLOGIES . AMERICA COMPETES IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY WHERE INNOVATION AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP ARE THE PILLARS OF PROSPERITY . THE COMPETITION IS STIFF AND THE STAKES ARE HIGH . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO APPLY AMERICA'S TECHNOLOGICAL SUPREMACY TO CAPTURE THE EXPORT MARKETS FOR ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES , UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL INVESTMENT AND GOOD JOBS IT WILL PROVIDE . OUR INNOVATORS , SCIENTISTS , ENTREPRENEURS AND WORKERS HAVE THE KNOWLEDGE , RESOURCES , AND DRIVE TO LEAD THE WAY ON ENERGY SECURITY , AS WE HAVE IN SO MANY OTHER WORLD-CHANGING UNKNOWNWORD . THE RACE HAS ALWAYS BEEN TO THE UNKNOWNWORD , AND AMERICA MUST BE FIRST TO MARKET WITH UNKNOWNWORD THAT MEET MANKIND'S GROWING ENERGY AND ENVIRONMENTAL NEEDS . I HAVE PROPOSED A BIPARTISAN PLAN TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND STIMULATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND USE OF ADVANCED TECHNOLOGIES . IT IS A MARKET-BASED APPROACH THAT WOULD SET REASONABLE CAPS ON CARBON AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS , AND PROVIDE INDUSTRIES WITH TRADABLE CREDITS . BY REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS , A UTILITY OR INDUSTRIAL PLANT CAN GENERATE CREDITS IT MAY TRADE ON THE OPEN MARKET FOR A PROFIT , OFFERING A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO DRIVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND BETTER ENERGY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES ; FOR AUTOMAKERS TO DEVELOP NEW WAYS TO LOWER POLLUTION AND INCREASE MILEAGE ; FOR UTILITIES TO GENERATE CLEANER ELECTRICITY AND CAPTURE CARBON ; FOR APPLIANCE MANUFACTURERS TO MAKE MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTS , AND FOR THE NATION TO USE ENERGY WITH MAXIMUM EFFICIENCY - BUILDING CONSERVATION INTO THE ECONOMY IN A MANNER THAT PRODUCES FINANCIAL AND ENVIRONMENTAL BENEFITS . AS IT ALWAYS DOES , THE PROFIT UNKNOWNWORD WILL ATTRACT THE TRANSFORMATIONAL POWER OF VENTURE CAPITAL , AND UNLEASH THE MARKET TO MOVE CLEAN ALTERNATIVE FUELS AND ADVANCED ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE MARGINS INTO THE MAINSTREAM . SOME URGE WE DO NOTHING BECAUSE WE CAN'T BE CERTAIN HOW BAD THE PROBLEM MIGHT BECOME OR THEY PRESUME THE WORST EFFECTS ARE MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR IN OUR GRANDCHILDREN'S LIFETIME . I'M A PROUD CONSERVATIVE , AND I REJECT THAT KIND OF LIVE-FOR-TODAY , 'ME GENERATION ,' ATTITUDE . IT IS UNWORTHY OF US . AMERICANS HAVE NEVER FEARED CHANGE . WE MAKE CHANGE WORK FOR US . CLIMATE CHANGE IS A GLOBAL PROBLEM THAT REQUIRES A GLOBAL SOLUTION . AMERICA HAS BOTH AN OBLIGATION AND A COMPELLING NATIONAL INTEREST IN FULFILLING OUR HISTORIC LEADERSHIP ROLE . CHINA'S CARBON EMISSIONS WILL SOON EXCEED OURS . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL INVITE A COLLABORATIVE RELATIONSHIP WITH CHINA TO MAKE COAL USE CLEANER AND CLIMATE FRIENDLY . BUT , WE SHOULD ADDRESS THE PROBLEM ON OUR TERMS , AND BRING OTHERS INTO THE FOLD OF A COMMON SENSE EFFORT TO SOLVE IT , WHILE WE SELL TO THE WORLD THE TECHNOLOGIES NEEDED TO DO IT . ANSWERING GREAT CHALLENGES IS NOTHING NEW TO AMERICA . IT'S WHAT WE DO . WE BUILT THE ROCKETS THAT TOOK US TO THE MOON NOT BECAUSE IT WAS EASY BUT BECAUSE IT WAS HARD . WE'VE SENT SPACE UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE DISTANT REACHES OF THE UNIVERSE . WE UNKNOWNWORD NUCLEAR ENERGY , MAPPED THE HUMAN GENOME , CREATED THE INTERNET AND UNKNOWNWORD INTEGRATED CIRCUITS THAT POSSESS THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER OF APOLLO SPACECRAFT ON A SINGLE SILICON UNKNOWNWORD YOU CAN BARELY SEE . WE CAN SOLVE OUR OIL DEPENDENCE AND BECOME MORE ENERGY SECURE . WE CAN LEAVE A CLEANER PLANET FOR THE NEXT GENERATION . YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME THE PROBLEM IS INSURMOUNTABLE . I KNOW MY COUNTRY . I KNOW WHAT WE'RE CAPABLE OF . WE'RE CAPABLE OF UNIMAGINABLE PROGRESS , UNMATCHED PROSPERITY , AND VISION THAT SEES AROUND THE CORNER OF HISTORY . WE'VE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD OUR TIMES , ACCEPTED OUR CHALLENGES AND MADE FROM OUR OPPORTUNITIES , ANOTHER BETTER WORLD . MY PEOPLE ARE AMERICANS . OUR TIME IS TODAY . THAT IS THE COUNTRY I ASK TO LEAD .
RED	MY FRIENDS , WE ARE AT LAST NEARING THE MOMENT IN THIS LONG ELECTION SEASON WHEN SOMETHING IMPORTANT HAPPENS : THE VOTERS GET TO SPEAK . UNTIL NOW , THE RACE HAS BEEN DEFINED BY POLITICAL PROFESSIONALS AND PUNDITS , WHO TALK ABOUT POLLS , AND MONEY , AND ADS , AND ENDORSEMENTS , AND WHO WON DEBATES , AND WHO ATTACKED WHOM , AND ALL THE THINGS THAT MAKE THESE CAMPAIGNS INTERESTING TO WASHINGTON , AND LESS SO TO YOU . NOW IT'S YOUR TURN . IN LESS THAN TWO MONTHS , THE VOTERS OF NEW HAMPSHIRE WILL CHOOSE THE MAN OR WOMAN THEY BELIEVE SHOULD LEAD THIS COUNTRY FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . I TRUST YOU TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION ABOUT WHO HAS THE EXPERIENCE , JUDGMENT , CHARACTER AND COURAGE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY AT A CRITICAL HOUR IN OUR HISTORY . IT'S EASY TO LOSE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IMPORTANCE OF THIS ELECTION GIVEN ALL THE NONSENSE THAT SEEMED TO DOMINATE MUCH OF ITS COVERAGE TO DATE . BUT NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS UNDERSTAND OUR NATION FACES A TRULY HISTORIC DECISION THAT WILL AFFECT NOT ONLY AMERICA'S DESTINY BUT THE COURSE OF HUMAN HISTORY . WE LIVE IN MOMENTOUS TIMES . WE FACE A GLOBAL THREAT FROM ENEMIES FOR WHOM NO ATTACK IS TOO CRUEL . THE WORLD IS CHANGING IN PROFOUND WAYS . WE NEED TO MAKE THOSE CHANGES WORK FOR US AND FOR ALL PEOPLE WHO SHARE OUR BELIEFS IN FREE MARKETS AND FREE PEOPLE . OUR GOVERNMENT HAS FAILED TO MEET SOME OF ITS MOST BASIC RESPONSIBILITIES AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LOST TRUST I UNKNOWNWORD THEIR LEADERS . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT BIG THINGS , NOT SMALL ONES . WE CAN'T MUDDLE THROUGH THE NEXT FOUR YEARS , BICKERING AMONG OURSELVES , AND LEAVE TO OTHERS THE WORK THAT IS OURS TO DO . NOW THE RESPONSIBILITY AGAIN FALLS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO SET THE COURSE WE FOLLOW IN THE YEARS AHEAD : WHETHER WE GO FORWARD OR BACKWARD ; WHETHER WE FEAR THE FUTURE OR MAKE HISTORY . THAT IS YOUR CHOICE IN THIS ELECTION , AND IT COULDN'T BE A BIGGER ONE . WHEN YOU MAKE YOUR DECISION , YOU MUST ASK YOURSELF TWO QUESTIONS : WHICH CANDIDATE HAS THE BEST CHANCE TO LEAD OUR PARTY TO VICTORY ; AND WHICH IS BEST PREPARED AND MOST COMMITTED TO KEEPING THIS NATION SAFE , PROSPEROUS , AND POWERFUL . I BELIEVE THE ANSWER TO BOTH QUESTIONS IS THE SAME . I AM THAT CANDIDATE . AND I ASK FOR YOUR VOTE . I'M THE CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF DEFEATING SENATOR CLINTON , OR WHOMEVER THE DEMOCRATS NOMINATE , AND TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT US . I'M AS COMMITTED TODAY AS WHEN I FIRST PUT ON THE UNIFORM OF OUR COUNTRY TO THE CAUSE THAT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MY LIFE : THE INTERESTS AND IDEALS OF OUR COUNTRY . I'M NO MORE A PERFECT SERVANT OF MY COUNTRY THAN I AM A PERFECT HUMAN BEING . BUT IN MY YEARS OF SERVICE , I HOPE I HAVE PROVEN MYSELF WORTHY OF YOUR TRUST . WE FACE FORMIDABLE CHALLENGES , BUT I'M NOT AFRAID OF THEM . I'M PREPARED FOR THEM . I KNOW HOW THE MILITARY WORKS , WHAT IT CAN DO , WHAT IT CAN DO BETTER , AND WHAT IT SHOULD NOT DO . I KNOW HOW CONGRESS WORKS , HOW TO MAKE IT WORK FOR THE COUNTRY AND NOT JUST THE RE-ELECTION OF ITS MEMBERS . I KNOW HOW THE WORLD WORKS . I KNOW THE GOOD AND THE EVIL IN IT . I KNOW HOW TO WORK WITH LEADERS WHO SHARE OUR DREAMS OF A FREER , SAFER AND MORE PROSPEROUS WORLD , AND HOW TO STAND UP TO THOSE WHO DON'T . I KNOW HOW TO FIGHT AND HOW TO MAKE PEACE . IF I'M YOUR NOMINEE AND SENATOR CLINTON IS THE NOMINEE OF THE OTHER PARTY , THE COUNTRY WILL FACE AS CLEAR A CHOICE AS ANY IN RECENT MEMORY . THAT'S AS IT SHOULD BE FOR SUCH AN IMPORTANT ELECTION . SHE WILL BE A FORMIDABLE CANDIDATE . AND WHILE OUR DIFFERENCES ARE MANY AND PROFOUND , I INTEND THIS TO BE A RESPECTFUL DEBATE . SHE AND I DISAGREE OVER AMERICA'S DIRECTION , AND IT IS A SERIOUS DISAGREEMENT . BUT I DON'T DOUBT HER ABILITY TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY WHERE SHE THINKS IT SHOULD GO . ON MATTERS OF WAR AND PEACE , I OFFER AMERICANS MY EXPERIENCE , MY PERSONAL FAMILIARITY WITH THE TRAGEDY OF WAR , DEEP INVOLVEMENT IN ALL OF THE NATIONAL SECURITY ISSUES OF THE LAST TWO DECADES , AND STEADFAST CONVICTION THAT AMERICA CANNOT AFFORD TO RELINQUISH ITS LEADERSHIP OF THE WORLD , AND THE WORLD CAN'T AFFORD IT EITHER . THERE COMES A TIME WHEN A PRESIDENT CAN NO LONGER RELY ON BRIEFING BOOKS AND POWER POINTS , WHEN THE EXPERTS AND ADVISORS HAVE ALL WEIGHED IN , WHEN THE SUM TOTAL OF ONE'S LIFE BECOMES THE FOUNDATION FROM WHICH HE OR SHE MAKES THE DECISIONS THAT DETERMINE THE COURSE OF HISTORY . NO OTHER CANDIDATE HAS MY EXPERIENCE OR THE JUDGMENT IT INFORMS . I WOULD NEVER MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT GOING TO WAR BASED ON WHETHER IT WAS A POPULAR THING TO DO . I WOULD ONLY MAKE THAT GRAVE DECISION WERE I CONVINCED AMERICA'S INTERESTS AND IDEALS WERE SO THREATENED THAT IT REQUIRED THE GREATEST SACRIFICE OUR COUNTRY CAN MAKE . AND ONCE I DECIDED , I WOULDN'T SURRENDER WHEN WE CAN STILL SUCCEED , AND ACCEPT THE TERRIBLE CONSEQUENCES THAT WOULD ENSUE , BECAUSE I FEARED THE POLLS MORE THAN HISTORY'S JUDGMENT . SENATOR CLINTON TOLD GENERAL PETRAEUS THAT HIS CONFIDENCE IN HIS NEW STRATEGY AND IN THE ABILITY OF THE TROOPS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND REQUIRED "A WILLING SUSPENSION OF UNKNOWNWORD ." NOW , IT BECOMES CLEAR THAT GENERAL PETRAEUS WAS RIGHT . FOR THE TIME BEING , SENATOR CLINTON HAS SUSPENDED HER BELIEF IN THE ABUNDANT EVIDENCE OF SUCCESS AS HER RIVALS AND THE FRINGE OF HER PARTY PULL HER TOWARD A POSITION SHE KNOWS IS IRRESPONSIBLE . I WAS THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN EITHER PARTY TO SAY WE WERE FOLLOWING A STRATEGY IN IRAQ THAT WAS DOOMED TO FAILURE , AND TO CALL FOR THE CHANGE THAT IS WORKING TODAY . I TOOK ABUSE FROM MEMBERS OF MY OWN PARTY -- SOME OF IT PRETTY TOUGH -- FOR DOING SO . AND I STUCK BY IT KNOWING IT COULD HURT MY CHANCES FOR THE PRESIDENCY . I DID IT FOR ONE REASON : I WOULD RATHER LOSE AN ELECTION THAN STAY SILENT AND WATCH MY COUNTRY LOSE A WAR . I WILL ALWAYS PUT AMERICA'S SECURITY BEFORE POLITICS , ALWAYS . ONE THE ONE HAND , SENATOR CLINTON SAYS WE CAN'T ABANDON IRAQ TO AL QAEDA AND THE INFLUENCE OF IRAN . ON THE OTHER , SHE WANTS A FIRM DEADLINE FOR WITHDRAWAL THAT WOULD DO JUST THAT . SENATOR CLINTON REJECTED UNCONDITIONAL TALKS WITH IRAN , BUT NOW SAYS SHE WOULD NEGOTIATE WITH NO CONDITIONS . AS WE DEAL WITH THE THREAT OF A NUCLEAR ARMED IRAN THERE ARE MANY THINGS WE CAN DO SHORT OF WAR TO PREVENT IRANIANS FROM MAKING THAT FATEFUL DECISION . WE CAN STRENGTHEN OUR DIPLOMACY , STAND UP TO THE RUSSIANS AND CHINESE , AND ORGANIZE OUR ALLIES AND IRAN'S NEIGHBORS TO IMPOSE TOUGH ECONOMIC SANCTIONS THAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD IRAN'S ECONOMY AND UNLEASH POPULAR RESENTMENT OF THE REGIME THAT SHOULD CAUSE THEM TO RECONSIDER THEIR DANGEROUS AMBITIONS . WE CAN MAKE IT VERY CLEAR TO IRAN'S LEADERS THAT WE WILL NOT ALLOW THEM TO OBTAIN WEAPONS THAT WOULD DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE MIDDLE EAST AND THREATEN AMERICA'S MOST VITAL SECURITY INTERESTS . SENATOR CLINTON WOULD START WITH UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS , DESPITE IRAN'S CLEAR RECORD OF USING NEGOTIATIONS TO FORESTALL SANCTIONS AND GROWING INTERNATIONAL OPPOSITION WHILE THEY ACCELERATE THEIR NUCLEAR PROGRAM . I WILL INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE ARMY AND MARINE CORPS . FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE ASKED TOO FEW TO DO TOO MUCH . WE HAVE ASKED OUR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN TO BID THEIR LOVED ONES UNKNOWNWORD FOR A THIRD OR FOURTH OR FIFTH COMBAT TOUR . WE NEED TO RECRUIT MORE AMERICANS WILLING TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY -- AND I KNOW THERE ARE MORE IF WE ONLY ASK THEM -- BUT FOR REASONS I WILL NEVER UNDERSTAND , THE FORMER SECRETARY OF DEFENSE REFUSED TO DO SO . TO REBUILD OUR MILITARY AS WELL AS THE CAPABILITIES OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AND LAW ENFORCEMENT AGENCIES ; AND THE CAPACITY OF ALL BRANCHES OF GOVERNMENT TO DEFEND US WILL REQUIRE SOME HARD CHOICES . WE WILL HAVE TO STOP THE INEXCUSABLE GROWTH OF GOVERNMENT IN OTHER AREAS . SENATOR CLINTON PROMISES TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF THE MILITARY AS WELL , BUT SHE WON'T MAKE THE TOUGH DECISIONS NECESSARY TO DO IT . I AM ABSOLUTELY COMMITTED TO REDUCING THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT . I'VE FOUGHT AGAINST WASTEFUL SPENDING AND BIG GOVERNMENT SOLUTIONS FROM MY FIRST DAY IN CONGRESS . SENATOR CLINTON WOULD PRESIDE OVER ANOTHER MASSIVE INCREASE IN THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT . SHE'LL HAVE WASHINGTON ASSUME MORE OF YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES , AND RAISE YOUR TAXES TO PAY FOR IT . SHE WON'T ADDRESS SERIOUSLY THE FISCAL CRISIS OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE OR IF SHE DOES SHE'LL LET CONGRESSIONAL DEMOCRATS CONVINCE HER TO RAISE YOUR TAXES . I WON'T IGNORE THE PROBLEM AND LEAVE IT TO ANOTHER UNLUCKIER GENERATION OF LEADERS AND I WON'T RAISE YOUR TAXES . I WILL WORK WITH CONGRESS IN AN OPEN AND SINCERE WAY TO ADDRESS THESE PROBLEMS , BUT IF AT THE END OF THE DAY , CONGRESS WANTS TO PLAY POLITICS WITH THE ISSUE , I WILL GO TO THEM AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND INSIST THEY VOTE UP OR DOWN ON MY PROPOSAL . I WON'T LACK THE COURAGE TO FIX OUR TOUGHEST PROBLEMS AND LET THEM BECOME WORSE ON SOMEONE ELSE'S WATCH . I'LL TAKE ON EVERY SPECIAL INTEREST IN TOWN TO FINALLY REFORM OUR UNKNOWNWORD COMPLICATED AND UNKNOWNWORD TAX CODE . SENATOR CLINTON WON'T . SENATOR CLINTON WILL ADDRESS THE LACK OF HEALTH CARE INSURANCE IN THIS COUNTRY BY PROPOSING ANOTHER BIG GOVERNMENT MANDATE . I'LL MAKE HEALTH CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE BY MAKING IT MORE AFFORDABLE , WITHOUT RUINING THE FINEST QUALITY HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD . SENATOR CLINTON WILL APPOINT MORE JUDGES WHO BELIEVE THEY SHOULD MAKE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE'S POLITICAL DECISIONS FOR THEM . I WILL APPOINT JUDGES WHO TAKE THEIR OATH TO PROTECT AND DEFEND THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES AS SERIOUSLY AS I TAKE MINE . THESE ARE SOME OF THE ESSENTIAL ISSUES THIS ELECTION WILL DECIDE . I OFFER ONE DIRECTION FOR AMERICA . SENATOR CLINTON AND HER DEMOCRATIC RIVALS OFFER ANOTHER , A COURSE I BELIEVE IS ABSOLUTELY WRONG FOR AMERICA AND WRONG FOR THE WORLD . IT IS YOUR TURN , MY FRIENDS , TO DECIDE WHO IS RIGHT . IT'S A HUGE RESPONSIBILITY . I KNOW YOU WILL TAKE IT SERIOUSLY . I DON'T EXPECT YOU TO TAKE OUR PROMISES ON FAITH . I EXPECT YOU TO LISTEN TO US , AS NEW HAMPSHIRE VOTERS ALWAYS DO , AND THEN EXAMINE OUR RECORDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN BE TRUSTED TO KEEP OUR WORD TO YOU . I DIDN'T SEEK PUBLIC OFFICE TO GO ALONG TO GET ALONG . I WENT TO WASHINGTON TO GET SOMETHING DONE FOR THE PEOPLE WHO SENT ME THERE . AND SINCE THEN , I KNOW I'VE MADE SOME PEOPLE ANGRY . I MADE DEFENSE CONTRACTORS ANGRY WHEN I BLEW THE UNKNOWNWORD ON A $30 BILLION BOONDOGGLE AND THE CULPRITS WERE SENT TO JAIL . I UPSET THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS WHEN I FOUGHT FOR ETHICS REFORM AND TO STOP UNION BOSSES AND CORPORATIONS FROM WRITING MILLION DOLLAR CHECKS TO POLITICAL CAMPAIGNS . I MADE THE PENTAGON ANGRY WHEN I CALLED FOR THE RESIGNATION OF DON RUMSFELD ; SAID WE NEEDED A DIFFERENT STRATEGY IN IRAQ ; AND A BIGGER MILITARY SO THAT OURS SONS AND DAUGHTERS DIDN'T HAVE TO SERVE FOUR AND FIVE TOURS IN COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD . I DISPLEASED A LOT OF THE MEDIA WHEN I SAID WE COULDN'T AFFORD TO FAIL IN IRAQ , AND STOOD BY THE CHANGES IN OUR STRATEGY THAT ARE NOW SHOWING SUCCESS . I MADE SOME FOLKS UNKNOWNWORD WHEN I WORKED TO CUT HARMFUL GREENHOUSE EMISSIONS BECAUSE I BELIEVE CLIMATE CHANGE IS A REAL AND NEEDS TO BE ADDRESSED NOW . I MADE POLITICIANS ANGRY WHEN I CALLED FOR EARMARK REFORM AND SPENDING CUTS ; FOR GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB ; TO DO IT BETTER AND WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY . I SAID NO TO BRIDGES TO NOWHERE AND 74 MILLION DOLLARS FOR PEANUT STORAGE IN A DEFENSE SPENDING BILL . YES , I'VE MADE A LOT OF PEOPLE ANGRY . BUT I DIDN'T GO TO WASHINGTON TO WIN THE MR . CONGENIALITY AWARD . I WENT THERE TO SERVE MY COUNTRY . I MIGHT NOT LIKE THE BUSINESS AS USUAL CROWD IN WASHINGTON , AND THEY MIGHT NOT LIKE ME . BUT I LOVE AMERICA . I LOVE HER ENOUGH TO MAKE SOME PEOPLE ANGRY . I'M GOING TO PUT THE BUSINESS AS USUAL CROWD OUT OF BUSINESS -- AND MAKE THEM THANK ME WHEN I DO . I WON'T ONLY RESTORE YOUR TRUST . I'LL MAKE YOU PROUD OF YOUR GOVERNMENT AGAIN . I'M GOING TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND POWERFUL . SO HELP ME GOD . AND I RESPECTFULLY ASK FOR YOUR VOTE TO HELP ME DO IT . THANK YOU .
RED	I'M PLEASED TO BE HERE AND GRATEFUL FOR THIS OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE WITH YOU MY VIEWS ABOUT THE IMPORTANCE OF IOWA TO OUR ECONOMY AND HOW I BELIEVE IOWA'S ECONOMY IS WELL SITUATED TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF INCREASES IN THE GLOBAL TRADE OF GOODS AND SERVICES . I'VE ENJOYED GETTING BETTER UNKNOWNWORD WITH IOWA THIS YEAR , AND I'VE LEARNED A LOT . I'VE LEARNED THAT WHILE IOWA TAKES GREAT PRIDE IN ITS TRADITION OF FAMILY FARMING , IT ALSO HAS A LARGE MANUFACTURING BASE , AND RANKS IN THE TOP TEN OF OUR FASTEST GROWING EXPORT STATES . THAT'S AN ENCOURAGING STATISTIC FOR IOWA BECAUSE , IRRESPECTIVE OF THE SPORADIC RISE OF PROTECTIONIST SENTIMENT IN THIS COUNTRY , OPENING NEW MARKETS FOR AMERICAN GOODS AND SERVICES IS INDISPENSABLE TO OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY , AND THOSE STATES BEST PREPARED TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF THE GLOBAL ECONOMY WILL PROSPER MOST . MY FRIENDS , WE CAN COMPETE WITH ANYONE . YOU WOULDN'T KNOW THAT BY LISTENING TO THE PROTECTIONISTS . THEY THINK WE'RE LIC KED . THEY THINK WE SHOULD HIDE BEHIND WALLS , AND HOPE WE HAVE ENOUGH LEFT TO LIVE ON WHILE THE WORLD PASSES US BY . THAT'S NOT LEADERSHIP , AND THAT'S NOT AMERICAN . MANY IOWANS HAVE HEARD THAT I OPPOSE FEDERAL SUBSIDIES FOR ETHANOL PRODUCTION . SOME OF YOU WILL HAVE HEARD THAT I OPPOSE A PROTECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL IMPORTS FROM PLACES LIKE BRAZIL . SOME OF MY OPPONENTS WILL DESCRIBE MY POSITIONS AS OPPOSITION TO AMERICAN ETHANOL PRODUCERS OR , FOR SOME INEXPLICABLE REASON , A PERSONAL DISLIKE OF IOWA . NEITHER IS TRUE , OF COURSE , AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO SET THE RECORD STRAIGHT . BUT I HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED BEFORE YOU CAN WIN SOMEONE'S VOTE , YOU HAVE TO EARN THEIR RESPECT . AND I INTEND TO EARN YOUR RESPECT BY BEING HONEST WITH YOU . YES , I OPPOSE SUBSIDIES . NOT JUST ETHANOL SUBSIDIES . SUBSIDIES . AND NOT JUST IN IOWA EITHER . I OPPOSE THEM IN MY OWN STATE OF ARIZONA . I AM A PROUD OF THE CONSERVATIVE TRADITION THAT THE GOVERNMENT CAN SOMETIMES BEST SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY KNOWING WHEN TO STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY . AND I'VE ALWAYS BEEN RELUCTANT TO GROW THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT TO DO THE BUSINESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FOR THEM OR TO FAVOR ONE INDUSTRY OVER ANOTHER OR BECAUSE ONE SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY HAS BETTER LOBBYISTS THAN ANOTHER . I WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO DO ITS JOB , NOT YOUR JOB , TO DO IT BETTER AND TO DO IT WITH LESS OF YOUR MONEY . I WANT OUR ECONOMY TO GROW , NOT THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT . AND I DON'T WANT GOVERNMENT TO DIVERT RESOURCES FROM THE GROWING INDUSTRIES THAT HOLD THE KEY TO AMERICA'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC SUCCESS . EXCESSIVE AND INTRUSIVE REGULATION UNDERMINES THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS . THERE IS NO ECONOMIC FORCE ON THIS GLOBE THAT IS STRONGER THAN FREE PEOPLE . ENTREPRENEURS LIE AT THE HEART OF INNOVATION , GROWTH , AND ADVANCING PROSPERITY . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE SHACKLED BY EXCESSIVE REGULATION THAT RAISES THE COST OF BUSINESS . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE DISADVANTAGED BY EARMARKING AND PORK-BARREL SPENDING THAT FAVORS POLITICALLY CONNECTED COMPETITORS . I TRUST AMERICANS , I TRUST MARKETS AND I OPPOSE SUBSIDIES . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL PROPOSE A NATIONAL ENERGY STRATEGY THAT WILL AMOUNT TO A DECLARATION OF INDEPENDENCE FROM THE RISK BRED BY OUR RELIANCE ON PETRO-DICTATORS AND OUR VULNERABILITY TO THE TROUBLED POLITICS OF THE LANDS THEY RULE . THAT STRATEGY WON'T BE ANOTHER GRAB BAG OF HANDOUTS TO THIS OR THAT INDUSTRY AND A FULL EMPLOYMENT ACT FOR LOBBYISTS . YES , THAT MEANS NO ETHANOL SUBSIDIES . BUT IT ALSO MEANS NO RIFLE-SHOT TAX BREAKS FOR BIG OIL . IT MEANS NO LINE ITEMS FOR HYDROGEN , NO MANDATES FOR OTHER RENEWABLE FUELS , AND NO UNKNOWNWORD DEBACLES LIKE THE DAKOTAS UNKNOWNWORD PLANT . IT MEANS ETHANOL ENTREPRENEURS GET A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD TO MAKE THEIR CASE -- AND EARN THEIR PROFITS . I BELIEVE THIS APPROACH ALLOWS IOWANS THEIR BEST OPPORTUNITY TO DISPLAY TO THE WORLD THE INGENUITY THAT HAS SERVED IOWA THROUGH THE YEARS . IOWANS WERE THE LEADERS IN AGRICULTURAL ADVANCEMENT , CONSERVATION AND LAND STEWARDSHIP . IOWA GAVE US UNKNOWNWORD DARLING , THE FATHER OF THE FEDERAL DUCK STAMP WHOSE ACTIONS WERE ESSENTIAL TO THE GENESIS OF THE NATIONAL WILDLIFE UNKNOWNWORD LAND CONSERVATION PROGRAM . MAX MCGRAW WAS INSTRUMENTAL IN ADVANCING THE TRANSPORTATION OF ELECTRICITY , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF UNKNOWNWORD POWER AS A MAJOR SOURCE OF ENERGY . HE ALSO WAS A CHAMPION OF INDUSTRY AND LAND CONSERVATION . IOWANS , THROUGH THEIR ABILITIES , THEIR FINE UNIVERSITIES , AND THEIR TRADITION OF HARD WORK AND INNOVATION WILL TRANSFORM THE ENERGY AND AGRICULTURE BUSINESS IN AMERICA AND MAKE US AN EVEN MORE SUCCESSFUL COMPETITOR ON THE WORLD STAGE . THEY WILL BEST DO THIS UNENCUMBERED WITH ILL-ADVISED GOVERNMENT SUBSIDIES THAT SERVE IN THE END TO RESTRICT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , STIFLE TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCEMENT AND RESTRAIN AMERICANS ' NATURAL ENTREPRENEURIAL DRIVE . IF I AM ELECTED PRESIDENT , I WILL CHANGE THE COMPETITIVE UNKNOWNWORD AND FINALLY GIVE IOWANS A FAIR CHANCE AND NO NEED FOR EXISTING SUBSIDIES . I HAVE PROPOSED A MARKET-BASED APPROACH THAT WOULD SET REASONABLE CAPS ON CARBON AND OTHER GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS , AND PROVIDE INDUSTRIES WITH TRADABLE CREDITS . BY REDUCING ITS EMISSIONS , A UTILITY OR INDUSTRIAL PLANT CAN GENERATE CREDITS IT MAY TRADE ON THE OPEN MARKET FOR A PROFIT , OFFERING A POWERFUL INCENTIVE TO DRIVE THE DEPLOYMENT OF NEW AND BETTER ENERGY SOURCES AND TECHNOLOGIES . THIS APPROACH WILL BUILD THE BUSINESS CASE FOR ALTERNATIVES TO OIL SUCH AS ETHANOL . IT WILL PROMOTE THE CONSERVATION AND DIVERSIFICATION OF ENERGY TO INCLUDE ALCOHOL FUELS MADE FROM CORN , SUGAR , SWITCHGRASS AND MANY OTHER SOURCES ; FUEL CELLS ; BIODIESEL DERIVED FROM WASTE PRODUCTS ; NATURAL GAS ; AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES . THESE ARE ALL PROMISING AND AVAILABLE ALTERNATIVES TO OIL , AND I'LL ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF INFRASTRUCTURE AND THE MARKET GROWTH NECESSARY FOR THESE PRODUCTS TO COMPETE , AND LET CONSUMERS CHOOSE THE WINNERS . I'VE NEVER KNOWN AN AMERICAN ENTREPRENEUR WORTHY OF THE NAME WHO WOULDN'T RATHER COMPETE FOR SALES THAN SUBSIDIES . I HAVE GREAT FAITH THAT MANY RESIDENTS OF THIS GREAT STATE SHARE THAT SAME CONFIDENCE IN OUR UNMATCHED ABILITY TO COMPETE ANYWHERE WITH ANYONE . WE NEED TO BE AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS . GLOBALIZATION IS HERE AND GLOBALIZATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY NOT A THREAT . THE AMERICAN FARMER IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE AND INNOVATIVE FARMER ON THE PLANET AND CAN COMPETE WITH ANYONE . PERIOD . BUT FARMERS CAN'T COMPETE IF THEY CAN'T GET INTO THE GAME . MY FRIENDS , 95 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S CUSTOMERS LIVE OUTSIDE THE BORDERS OF THE UNITED STATES . WHILE MY DEMOCRATIC OPPONENTS PLAY POLITICS WITH TRADE -- USING WORDS LIKE A TRADE "TIME OUT " TO DISGUISE THEIR PROTECTIONISM -- I DON'T INTEND TO SIT OUT OPPORTUNITIES AND CHALLENGES OF THE WORLD'S ECONOMY . I INTEND TO SEIZE THOSE OPPORTUNITIES TO ENSURE , AS EVERY AMERICAN GENERATION HAS DONE , THAT OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES WILL BE EVEN MORE PROSPEROUS THAN WERE OURS . WE NEED TO BUILD ON OUR EXPORT STRENGTH NOT BY BUILDING WALLS TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE . EXPORTS ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY ONE-HALF OF OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR , AND HELPED TO OFFSET THE DRAG ON OUR ECONOMY FROM THE HOUSING SLUMP . TODAY , DESPITE ALL THE DEFEATIST RHETORIC , AMERICA IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EXPORTER , IMPORTER , PRODUCER , SAVER , INVESTOR , MANUFACTURER AND INNOVATOR . I INTEND TO LEAD A GOVERNMENT THAT SECURES ACCESS TO WORLD MARKETS FOR OUR FARMERS , OUR ENTREPRENEURS , THEIR WORKERS , AND THE NEXT GENERATION . I AM COMMITTED TO HELPING EVERY FARMER IN THIS WAY , NOT JUST THE BIG UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAVE FIGURED OUT HOW TO GAME THE SUBSIDY PROCESS . AS I SAID , I INTEND TO BE HONEST WITH YOU . STRAIGHT TALK ISN'T JUST A CAMPAIGN SLOGAN OF MINE INVENTED BY CONSULTANTS . I DON'T KNOW ANY OTHER WAY TO CAMPAIGN , AND HAVE ALWAYS BELIEVED THAT IF I WERE HONEST WITH THE VOTERS ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE AND HOW I INTEND TO GOVERN , THEN EVERYTHING WILL BE ALRIGHT IN THE END . YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ME ON EVERY ISSUE , BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU OR MISREPRESENT MY INTENTIONS SHOULD I BE SO PRIVILEGED TO BE ELECTED TO THE OFFICE I SEEK . A CANDIDATE WHO TELLS YOU ONE THING AND TELLS ANOTHER GROUP OF VOTERS SOMETHING ELSE , DOESN'T RESPECT YOU , AND WON'T LEAD OUR PARTY TO VICTORY . BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS OUR SELF-RESPECT . I DON'T EXPECT VOTERS TO TRADE THEIRS FOR EMPTY PROMISES . AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRADE MINE FOR ANY OFFICE . I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY WILL . AMERICANS ARE WEARY OF EMPTY PROMISES , SPIN AND ELECTION YEAR CONVERSIONS . I KNOW THAT YOU HAVE HEARD BEFORE THAT SUBSIDIES TO OIL WILL BE ELIMINATED , ONLY TO EXPERIENCE ANOTHER DISAPPOINTMENT . MY FRIENDS , THIS IS ONE MORE REASON THAT AMERICANS HAVE LOST FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I'M NOT GOING TO MAKE PROMISES THAT AREN'T IN AMERICA'S INTEREST . THE LEADERS I'VE ALWAYS ADMIRED MOST DON'T PREFER EXPEDIENCY TO PRINCIPLE . THEY DON'T HIDE FROM A CHALLENGE . THEY DON'T PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS BEFORE THOSE OF OUR COUNTRY . THEY TELL US WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHERE THEY INTEND TO LEAD . THEY OFFER THEIR HONEST JUDGMENT NOT THEIR POLLSTER'S ADVICE . THEY HAVE CONVICTION , COURAGE , AND , MOST OF ALL , THE HUMILITY TO UNDERSTAND THEY SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST ; THAT OUR MOST SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN US THEIR TRUST BEFORE ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATION . TO WIN THIS ELECTION WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH A REPUTATION AND RECORD OF CHALLENGING THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND THE FAILED POLITICS OF THE PAST . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO IS SURE OF HIS CONVICTIONS ; WHO HASN'T CHANGED HIS POSITIONS ON THE PROFOUND MORAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY TO FIT THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY STRONG AND FREE FROM THE WASTE AND MISUSE OF POLITICIANS FOR WHOM RE-ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PROSPERITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND , ABOVE ALL , IN A TIME OF WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY FOR WHOM NO ATROCITY IS TOO CRUEL , WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH THE STRONGEST NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE SO THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF VOTERS WHICH CANDIDATE IS BEST PREPARED TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF FROM DAY ONE . IF I AM PRIVILEGED TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT , I PROMISE YOU , I WILL NEVER FORGET MY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND I INTEND TO WIN IT BACK , SO HELP ME GOD . YOU'LL KNOW WHERE I STAND , AND WHERE I INTEND TO LEAD . I AM THE ONLY CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN WHO WILL DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE , WHOEVER HE OR SHE IS . AND WHEN I DO , I DON'T INTEND TO USE MY PRESIDENCY TO AVOID THE HARDEST CHALLENGES AMERICA FACES , AND LEAVE THEM TO ANOTHER , UNLUCKIER GENERATION OF LEADERS . I DON'T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THE ELECTIONS I WON , FOR THE CELEBRITY I ACHIEVED , OR FOR THE PERSONAL PRIVILEGES I ENJOYED . I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A MAN WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY ; WHO WAS PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY , AND WHOSE COUNTRY WAS PROUD OF HIM . THAT HAS BEEN THE GREAT AMBITION OF MY LIFE . I HAVE NO NEED OF ANY OTHER . AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY I KNOW HOW TO ACHIEVE IT : TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE EVEN WHEN THE ROAD IS LONG AND DIFFICULT ; TO UNKNOWNWORD BSP;UP FOR MY COUNTRY AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ; TO STAND UP PROUDLY , HONESTLY , DEFIANTLY FOR THE PRINCIPLES , IDEALS AND VIRTUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY "THE LAST , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ."
RED	THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO YOU . WE ALL KNOW HOW IMPORTANT FLORIDA WILL BE IN DETERMINING THE OUTCOME OF THIS ELECTION , NO LESS SO THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE LAST TWO PRESIDENTIAL ELECTIONS . AND I THINK REPUBLICANS IN FLORIDA AND REPUBLICANS EVERYWHERE UNDERSTAND THAT WE FACE SUBSTANTIAL CHALLENGES AND SOME PRETTY STIFF COMPETITION . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO FIGHT HARD TO WIN . BUT WE WILL WIN , AND WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY MAKING CLEAR TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HOW HIGH THE STAKES ARE IN THIS ELECTION , AND HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT WE KEEP AMERICA MOVING FORWARD AND NOT RETURN TO THE FAILED POLICIES OF THE PAST AS OUR FRIENDS IN THE OTHER PARTY WOULD HAVE US DO . WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY BEING HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES AMERICA CONFRONTS , AND STRAIGHTFORWARD , BOLD AND BRAVE ABOUT THE DIRECTION WE INTEND TO LEAD THE COUNTRY . WE'RE GOING TO DO IT BY HAVING THE COURAGE OF OUR CONVICTIONS , AND BY CONVINCING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT WE WILL NOT YIELD , WAFFLE , MISLEAD , OR UNKNOWNWORD IRK OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO KEEP THIS COUNTRY SAFE , PROSPEROUS AND PROUD . I ONCE LIVED IN THIS GREAT STATE . AND WHEN I WAS AWAY FROM MY COUNTRY ON AN EXTENDED TOUR OF DUTY , MY FLORIDA NEIGHBORS LOOKED AFTER MY FAMILY WITH GREAT CARE AND AFFECTION . I THINK I KNOW THE PEOPLE OF FLORIDA PRETTY WELL . I KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I HAVE TO WIN YOUR RESPECT . AND TO DO THAT , YOU EXPECT ME TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE . YOU MIGHT NOT AGREE WITH ME ON EVERY ISSUE , BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW I'M NOT TRYING TO TRICK YOU OR MISREPRESENT MY INTENTIONS SHOULD I BE SO PRIVILEGED TO BE ELECTED TO THE OFFICE I SEEK . A CANDIDATE WHO TELLS YOU ONE THING AND TELLS ANOTHER GROUP OF VOTERS SOMETHING ELSE , DOESN'T RESPECT YOU , AND WON'T LEAD OUR PARTY TO VICTORY . BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS OUR SELF-RESPECT . I DON'T EXPECT VOTERS TO TRADE THEIRS FOR EMPTY PROMISES . AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRADE MINE FOR ANY OFFICE . I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE AND LET THE CHIPS FALL UNKNOWNWORD ERE THEY WILL . AMERICANS ARE WEARY OF EMPTY PROMISES , SPIN AND ELECTION YEAR CONVERSIONS . THEY WANT LEADERSHIP , AND LEADERS DON'T PREFER EXPEDIENCY TO PRINCIPLE . THEY DON'T HIDE FROM A CHALLENGE . THEY DON'T PUT THEIR OWN INTERESTS BEFORE OUR COUNTRY'S . THEY TELL US WHAT THEY BELIEVE AND WHERE THEY INTEND TO LEAD . THEY OFFER THEIR HONEST JUDGMENT NOT THEIR POLLSTER'S ADVICE . THEY HAVE CONVICTION , COURAGE , AND , MOST OF ALL , THE HUMILITY TO UNDERSTAND THEY SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST ; THAT OUR MOST SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY IS TO PUT THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE GIVEN US THEIR TRUST BEFORE ANY PERSONAL CONSIDERATION . IF I AM PRIVILEGED TO BE YOUR NOMINEE , I PROMISE YOU , I WILL NEVER FORGET MY OBLIGATIONS TO YOU . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND I INTEND TO WIN IT BACK , SO HELP ME GOD . YOU'LL KNOW WHERE I STAND , AND WHERE I INTEND TO LEAD . I WILL DEFEAT THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE , WHOEVER HE OR SHE IS . AND WHEN I DO , I DON'T INTEND TO USE MY PRESIDENCY TO AVOID THE HARDEST CHALLENGES AMERICA FACES , AND LEAVE THEM TO ANOTHER , UNLUCKIER GENERATION OF LEADERS . I DON'T WANT TO BE REMEMBERED FOR THE ELECTIONS I WON , FOR THE CELEBRITY I ACHIEVED , OR FOR THE PERSONAL PRIVILEGES I ENJOYED . I WANT TO BE REMEMBERED AS A MAN WHO LOVED HIS COUNTRY ; WHO WAS PROUD OF HIS COUNTRY , AND WHOSE COUNTRY WAS PROUD OF HIM . THAT HAS BEEN THE GREAT AMBITION OF MY LIFE . I HAVE NO NEED OF ANY OTHER . AND THERE IS ONLY ONE WAY I KNOW HOW TO ACHIEVE IT : TO STAND UP FOR WHAT I BELIEVE EVEN WHEN THE ROAD IS LONG AND DIFFICULT ; TO STAND UP FOR MY COUNTRY AGAINST ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ; TO STAND UP PROUDLY , HONESTLY , DEFIANTLY FOR THE PRINCIPLES , IDEALS AND VIRTUES THAT HAVE MADE THIS COUNTRY "THE LAST , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ." TO WIN THIS ELECTION WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO CAN KEEP THE REPUBLICAN COALITION TOGETHER AND UNKNOWNWORD TO INDEPENDENTS . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH A REPUTATION FOR CHALLENGING THE WASHINGTON ESTABLISHMENT AND THE FAILED POLITICS OF THE PAST . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO IS SURE OF HIS CONVICTIONS ; WHO HASN'T CHANGED HIS POSITIONS ON THE PROFOUND MORAL ISSUES OF OUR DAY TO FIT THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT . WE NEED A CANDIDATE WHO WILL KEEP OUR ECONOMY STRONG AND FREE FROM THE WASTE AND MISUSE OF POLITICIANS FOR WHOM RE-ELECTION IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN THE PROSPERITY OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND , ABOVE ALL , IN A TIME OF WAR AGAINST AN ENEMY FOR WHOM NO ATROCITY IS TOO CRUEL , WE NEED A CANDIDATE WITH THE STRONGEST NATIONAL SECURITY EXPERIENCE SO THAT THERE IS NO DOUBT IN THE MINDS OF VOTERS WHICH CANDIDATE IS BEST PREPARED TO BE COMMANDER IN CHIEF FROM DAY ONE . WE CANNOT CONCEDE ANY IMPORTANT ISSUE TO THE DEMOCRATS . BUT NEITHER CAN WE ADOPT THE FLAWED SOLUTIONS THEY PROPOSE OR ABANDON OUR PRINCIPLES IN TELLING AMERICANS HOW WE INTEND TO ADDRESS THEM . WE SHOULD NOT AVOID THE LOOMING BANKRUPTCY OF OUR ENTITLEMENTS . BUT WE MUST NOT PROMISE TO TAX AND SPEND OUR WAY TO GREATER PROSPERITY . WE SHOULD NOT IGNORE PROBLEMS LIKE HEALTH CARE AND GLOBAL WARMING , BUT WE MUST NOT OFFER UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSALS THAT PREFER THE WISDOM OF GOVERNMENT BUREAUCRATS TO THE POWER OF FREE MARKETS AND THE COMMON SENSE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WE ARE APPROACHING A "PERFECT STORM " OF PROBLEMS THAT IF NOT ADDRESSED BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT , WILL CAUSE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO IMPLODE . HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW : WE CURRENTLY 2.2 TRILLION DOLLARS ON HEALTH CARE . BY 2015 , THAT NUMBER WILL NEARLY DOUBLE TO FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS . BY 2019 MEDICARE WILL BE BROKE . WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING MORE ON MEDICARE THAN WE ARE COLLECTING IN PAYROLL TAXES AND CASHING IN THE FEW IOU'S LEFT IN THE TRUST FUND . BY 2017 MORE MONEY WILL BE GOING OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAN IS COMING IN . THE NEXT PRESIDENT MUST ACT TO AVERT THE IMPENDING "STORM ." I WON'T LEAVE OFFICE WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIX THESE PROBLEMS THAT SO SEVERELY THREATEN OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY AND POWER . LAST WEEK I OFFERED MY PLAN TO REFORM AND STRENGTHEN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . IT'S A PLAN BUILT ON A SIMPLE PREMISE : BRINGING SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS UNDER CONTROL THROUGH MARKET COMPETITION . IT WILL BENEFIT CONSUMERS AND IMPROVE PATIENT CARE ; INCREASE COVERAGE BY MAKING INSURANCE MORE AFFORDABLE ; AND STRENGTHEN AMERICAN ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS ACROSS THE GLOBE . MY PLAN PUTS THE NEEDS OF INDIVIDUALS AND FAMILIES FIRST , NOT GOVERNMENT AND INSURANCE BUREAUCRACIES . IT PROMOTES STRONG HEALTH CARE MARKETS BY ALLOWING FAMILIES TO PURCHASE INSURANCE ACROSS STATE LINES AND THROUGH ANY WILLING PROVIDER SUCH AS AN ASSOCIATION OR A CHURCH . IT TAKES UP THE CHALLENGE OF TORT REFORM TO STOP FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS THAT ENRICH TRIAL LAWYERS WHILE RAISING HEALTH COSTS FOR EVERYONE ELSE . IT EXPANDS THE PROVEN BENEFITS OF MARKET COMPETITION BY ENCOURAGING A MORE EFFICIENT PROCESS FOR BRINGING CHEAPER GENERIC DRUGS TO CONSUMERS SOONER AND DEVE LOPING A WORKABLE SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE SAFE REIMPORTATION OF DRUGS TO KEEP COMPETITION VIGOROUS . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY WISELY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . WHEN CONGRESS SENDS ME ONE OF THESE HUGE , PORK BARREL BILLS TO MY DESK , I WILL VETO IT , AND I WILL MAKE THE AUTHORS WHO WROTE IT FAMOUS . YOU'LL KNOW THEIR NAMES , AND YOU CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE . OF COURSE , THE MOST IMPORTANT CHALLENGE THAT WILL CONFRONT THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS DEFENDING AMERICA FROM THE ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WHO HATE US AND OUR VALUES , AND WHO WILL DO ANYTHING -- ANYTHING , NO MATTER HOW CRUEL OR VIOLENT -- TO HURT AS MANY AMERICANS AS THEY CAN . THEY ARE AN IMPLACABLE AND UNPARDONABLE ENEMY FIERCELY DEDICATED TO OUR DESTRUCTION . THEY ARE GLOBAL IN REACH , OPERATING IN EUROPE , THE AMERICAS , AFRICA , THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA . JUST LAST MONTH , TERRORIST PLOTS WERE UNCOVERED IN DENMARK AND GERMANY THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS . HERE AT HOME WE'VE DISRUPTED PLOTS AGAINST JFK AIRPORT IN NEW YORK AND AGAINST AMERICAN SOLDIERS AT FT . DIX . THEY INTEND TO ACQUIRE WEAPONS OF MASS DESTRUCTION TO KILL AS MANY INNOCENT PEOPLE AS THEY CAN . THEY WILL NOT RELENT . THEY WILL NOT TIRE OF THE FIGHT AND GO AWAY . THEY MUST BE DEFEATED , DEFEATED UTTERLY , WHEREVER THEY ARE . YET MUCH OF WASHING TON REMAINS MIRED IN IRRESOLUTION AND DEFEATISM BECAUSE THE CHALLENGE IS HARD AND COMPLEX AND LONG . BUT I AM NOT . I KNOW THE COUNTRY I WISH TO LEAD . I KNOW ITS STRENGTH . I KNOW ITS VIRTUES . AND I KNOW WE WILL NEVER FACE ANY THREAT STRONGER THAN THE COURAGE , RESOURCEFULNESS , AND DETERMINATION OF FREE PEOPLE , WHO WILL NOT FORGET WHO THEY ARE , LOSE THEIR CONFIDENCE , UNKNOWNWORD TO FEAR , OR LIMIT THEIR DREAMS BECAUSE A HATEFUL , EVIL ENEMY EXPECTS THEM TO . THEY WILL MEET AND DESTROY THAT ENEMY , BECAUSE WHAT AMERICANS BELIEVE , WHAT WE KNOW , IS GREAT , TRUE , AND A BLESSING . WE DON'T HIDE FROM HISTORY . WE MAKE HISTORY . THREE DECADES AGO , A VISIONARY POLITICIAN , A MAN OF FIRM CONVICTIONS AND AN ABIDING RESPECT FOR THE VALUES AND STRENGTH OF HIS COUNTRY , DESCRIBED THE DANGERS IN THE WORLD . IT WAS , LIKE TODAY , A TIME WHEN SOME DOUBTED AMERICA'S GOODNESS AND GREATNESS . MANY ARGUED FOR RECONCILIATION WITH OUR GLOBAL ADVERSARY . BUT THIS MAN HELD FIRM . HE DID NOT CARE WHAT EDITORIAL BOARDS WROTE ABOUT HIM . HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT . HE CRITICIZED A FOREIGN POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION . HE CALLED FOR RESOLVE AND FIRMNESS IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION . AND , HE REFUSED TO CONDEMN MILLIONS TO PERPETUAL COMMUNIST TYRANNY IN THE FALSE HOPE THAT ACCOMMODATING THE SOVIET UNION WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S SECURITY . FORTUNATELY , THIS MAN BECAME PRESIDENT . HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE HAD RONALD REAGAN NOT WON ELECTION IN 1980 AND 1984 ? DOES ANYONE BELIEVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CALLED THE SOVIET UNION AN "EVIL EMPIRE " OR WOULD HAVE STOOD UP TO THE NUCLEAR FREEZE MOVEMENT ; WOULD HAVE PROMISED THAT COMMUNISM WOULD BE LEFT ON THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY ; WOULD HAVE DEMANDED THAT A SOVIET LEADER TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL ? WHILE HIS CRITICS AND OPPONENTS TRIED TO HIDE FROM HISTORY . RONALD REAGAN SUMMONED US TO MAKE HISTORY ; TO MAKE ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , WHERE OUR INTERESTS WERE SECURE , AND OUR VALUES ASCENDANT . HE WAS STEADFAST IN THE FACE OF FIERCE CRITICISM , INTERNATIONAL IRRESOLUTION AND DETERMINED ADVERSARIES . AND HE WAS RIGHT . WE WON THE COLD WAR AS WE WILL WIN THIS NEW AND DANGEROUS WAR : ON OUR TERMS ; FOR THE SAKE OF ALL HUMANITY ; FOR THE RIGHT OF FREE PEOPLE TO LIVE WITHOUT FEAR ; AND WITH THE PROMISE OF ANOTHER , BETTER UNKNOWNWORD RLD SECURE AND WITHIN OUR REACH . TODAY , THE CHALLENGES ARE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THEY WERE WHEN RONALD REAGAN LED US . AND , TODAY , THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ARE EVERY BIT AS STARK . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE AGAINST FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS ENGAGED IN WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A WAR ON TERROR , OFFER TO ENTER INTO UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR WORST ENEMIES , AND TALK ABOUT COUNTERING THE FORCES OF RADICALISM BY ADVOCATING SURRENDER TO THEM IN IRAQ . IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY IN IRAQ , IF WE CEDE IRAQ TO AL QAEDA , DEATH SQUADS AND IRAN AND SYRIA , HOW LONG WILL THEY STAY THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN ? WE FACE GRAVE CHALLENGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST : HALTING IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS ; PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY , ISRAEL ; SUPPORTING MODERATE VOICES AGAINST THE KILLERS OF HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; DEFENDING LEBANON'S SOVEREIGNTY AGAINST SYRIAN AND IRANIAN AGGRESSION . DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT IN IRAQ ? IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO THINK SO , AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO DOES ISN'T PREPARED TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY IN THIS CRITICAL HOUR . THE WORLD RONALD REGAN FACED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT IRRATIONAL . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH CRUELTY AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS MY FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE FACE AN ENEMY THAT SO DESPISES US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . BUT WE ARE AMERICANS , AND WE STILL HAVE IT IN OUR POWER TO MAKE HISTORY , A HISTORY IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . LET US ACCEPT THE CHALLENGE THAT HISTORY HAS ASSIGNED TO US , BRAVELY , CONFIDENT IN OUR IDEALS AND PURPOSE , AND SURE OF OUR STRENGTH . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT BEFALL US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL CHOSEN . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL -- THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT -- HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION O F THE BEST AMERICANS , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND COSTLY CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE FOR US AND FOR THE WORLD . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE BRAVER OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU .
RED	THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF SPEAKING BEFORE THIS GATHERING , AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO IN SUPPORTING THE PRESERVATION OF THE FAMILY , THE MOST BASIC AND ESSENTIAL COMPONENT OF ANY CIVIL SOCIETY . I KNOW THAT BEFORE I CAN WIN YOUR VOTE , I HAVE TO WIN YOUR RESPECT . AND TO DO THAT , YOU EXPECT ME TO BE HONEST WITH YOU ABOUT WHAT I BELIEVE . I'M A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN , AND PROUD OF IT . I'LL MATCH MY RECORD OF DEFENDING CONSERVATIVE PRINCIPLES AGAINST ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE . I KNOW YOU MIGHT NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH ME ON EVERY ISSUE , BUT I HOPE YOU KNOW I'M NOT GOING TO CON YOU . ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THINGS WE HAVE IN THIS LIFE IS OUR SELF-RESPECT . I DON'T EXPECT YOU TRADE YOURS FOR EMPTY PROMISES . AND I'M NOT GOING TO TRADE MINE FOR UNKNOWNWORD VOTE . I'M GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT I BELIEVE AND LET THE CHIPS FALL WHERE THEY WILL . SOME PEOPLE MISUNDERSTAND VOTERS WHO ARE CONCERNED WITH SOMETHING BEYOND THEIR ECONOMIC SELF INTEREST AND BELIEVE THAT THE DEMANDS OF SELF-INTEREST ARE BEST SERVED BY THE PRIORITIES OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY . I DISAGREE . I BELIEVE REPUBLICAN ECONOMIC POLICIES , OUR RESPECT FOR THE DYNAMISM AND GROWTH CREATED BY FREE MARKETS , HAVE PROVED THE SUREST WAY TO HELP PEOPLE EARN AND MAINTAIN PROSPERITY . VOTING FOR WHOMEVER YOU BELIEVE WILL BRING HOME THE MOST PORK TO YOUR STATE OR DISTRICT IS NEITHER IN YOUR SELF-INTEREST NOR DOES IT RESPECT THE FAITH WE HAVE IN A NATION THAT WAS FOUNDED ON IDEALS AND NOT TRIBAL OR UNKNOWNWORD IDENTITIES . THAT IS WHY FOR MY ENTIRE POLITICAL CAREER I HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST WASTEFUL SPENDING SO THAT AMERICAN FAMILIES WOULD HAVE THE FREEDOM AND MEANS TO MAKE THEIR OWN CHOICES , AND TO CHOOSE , AS I HOPE MOST WOULD , AND AS YOU HAVE , TO SERVE A CAUSE GREATER THAN SELF-INTEREST . I BELIEVE THAT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD AND PRIORITY OF A VALUES VOTER . VALUES ARE THE IDEALS WE HOLD DEAR , AND ARE BEST PROTECTED BY REVIVING VIRTUES THAT ARE OFTEN IN SHORT SUPPLY IN THE POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD . OUR FOUNDING FATHERS WERE INFORMED BY THE RESPECT FOR HUMAN LIFE AND DIGNITY THAT IS THE FOUNDATION OF THE JUDEO-CHRISTIAN TRADITION . THEY ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD TRUTHS PROCLAIMED AND DEFENDED IN OUR FOUNDING DOCUMENTS . ALL PEOPLE ARE ENDOWED BY THEIR CREATOR WITH INALIENABLE RIGHTS TO LIFE , LIBERTY AND THE PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS . FOR MANY OF US , THE MEANINGFUL PURSUIT OF HAPPINESS COMPELS US TO DEFEND THOSE IDEALS , AND IN THIS HOUR THAT SUMMONS HAS NEVER BEEN MORE URGENT AS AMERICA CONFRONTS CHALLENGES TO ITS FOUNDING VALUES , PARTICULARLY THE SANCTITY OF HUMAN LIFE , AT HOME AND ABROAD . WE ARE INVOLVED IN BOTH A STRUGGLE AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND A STRUGGLE TO PROTECT AMERICA WHILE PRESERVING THE VALUES THAT MAKE IT WORTH PROTECTING . BOTH OF THESE STRUGGLES WILL DEMAND COURAGE AND PERSEVERANCE ON OUR PART AND ON THE PART OF OUR LEADERS . MANY AMERICAN GENERATIONS HAVE BEEN CALLED TO CONFRONT EVIL . MY FATHER AND GRANDFATHER FOUGHT FASCISM . MY GENERATION FOUGHT COMMUNISM . NOW WE ARE SUMMONED TO CONFRONT THE EVIL OF RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . THERE IS NO DENYING IT IS EVIL . HOW MORE EVIDENT COULD IT BE THAN IN THE MEANS OUR ENEMIES CHOOSE TO CONFRONT US . THEIR TERRORISM IS NOT ONLY AN UNKNOWNWORD ON OUR POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INTERESTS . IT IS AN ACT OF WAR AGAINST OUR DEFINING IDEALS . SACRIFICING MUSLIM CHILDREN IN CAR BOMBS . BEHEADING A REPORTER MERELY BECAUSE HE IS JEWISH AND AMERICAN , AND BROADCASTING THE ATROCITY . THESE ARE THE TACTICS OF PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWNWORD HUMAN LIFE AND DIGNITY . AND WE ARE SUMMONED TO FIGHT THEM NOT ONLY BY OUR JUST CONCERN FOR OUR PHYSICAL SECURITY BUT BY THE RESPONSIBILITY WE HAVE ALWAYS ACCEPTED TO SUPPORT AND DEFEND VALUES WE BELIEVE TO BE UNIVERSAL . WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE STRATEGY TO SUCCEED IN THIS STRUGGLE . FOR NEARLY THREE DECADES WE WATCHED THE THREAT BUILD AND DID LITTLE TO CONTAIN IT UNTIL IT COULD BE IGNORED NO LONGER AFTER THE TERRIBLE EVENTS OF SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 . SINCE THAT TIME WE HAVE JOINED THE BATTLE ON MULTIPLE FRONTS . BUT WE ARE AT A UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS GLOBAL STRUGGLE , AND WE WILL NEED A PRESIDENT WHO HAS THE CREDIBILITY TO LEAD , THE EXPERIENCE TO LEAD WISELY , AND THE STRENGTH OF WILL TO TAKE THE RIGHT PATH , EVEN IF IT MEANS WALKING A LONELY ROAD . I HAVE SPOKEN ELSEWHERE AT LENGTH ABOUT THE STRATEGY I PROPOSE . WE NEED A LARGER MILITARY , REAL INTELLIGENCE REFORM , INCREASED CONTRIBUTIONS FROM OUR CIVILIAN AGENCIES , AND A COMMITMENT TO VICTORY IN IRAQ . AND WE NEED A COMPREHENSIVE LEGAL AND DIPLOMATIC STRATEGY THAT ALLOWS US TO BATTLE EFFECTIVELY A MODERN THREAT WITHOUT BETRAYING OUR IDEALS . THE WORLD IS WATCHING , AND WE LIVE IN A TIME WHEN THE IMAGES WE PROJECT CANNOT BE EASILY UNKNOWNWORD . CONFRONTING THE THREAT OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS IS A BATTLE AGAINST EXTERNAL FORCES , BUT ALSO INVOLVES A PERSONAL AND SOCIAL CONTEST WITH OUR OWN FEARS . WE WILL NOT SURRENDER TO THE TERRORISTS , AND WE MUST NOT SURRENDER TO OUR FEAR . WE MUST RESIST AT ALL COSTS THE TEMPTATION TO BELIEVE THAT WE CAN PROTECT AMERICA BY SACRIFICING THE VALUES THAT MAKE IT WORTH PROTECTING . I AM NOT NAIVE . I KNOW VERY WELL THE TOOLS SOME GOVERNMENTS HAVE RESORTED TO WHEN THREATENED : INDEFINITE DETENTION WITHOUT TRIAL , TORTURE OF PRISONERS , AND A BELIEF THAT ANYTHING IS PERMISSIBLE IN DARK PLACES WHERE POWER IS THE ONLY LAW . BUT THESE TOOLS ARE NOT AMERICAN TOOLS , AND THE EASY WAY IS NOT THE AMERICAN WAY . WE MUST REMAIN TRUE TO OUR IDEALS NOT IN SPITE OF THE THREATS WE FACE , BUT BECAUSE OF THEM . IN THE DECADES TO COME OUR PROSPERITY AND SECURITY WILL DEPEND IN PART ON WHAT PEOPLE IN DISTANT CORNERS OF THE GLOBE SEE WHEN THEY TURN THEIR EYES TOWARD AMERICA . AS PRESIDENT , I WOULD DO EVERYTHING WITHIN MY POWER TO ENSURE THAT THEY CONTINUE TO SEE WHAT THEY HAVE SEEN FOR OVER TWO HUNDRED YEARS : A NATION THAT REMAINS FULLY WORTHY OF ABRAHAM LINCOLN'S BELIEF THAT AMERICANS HOLD IN OUR HANDS NOT ONLY THE DESTINY OF A SINGLE NATION BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ." IT'S NOT EASY TO PRESERVE OUR IDEALS IN THE MIDST OF A DIFFICULT STRUGGLE WITH THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD EVERY VALUE WE STAND FOR . IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE THE HUMANITY OF OUR ENEMIES , WHO REFUSE TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR HUMANITY , AND WHOSE CRUELTY IS SO WANTON AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE BIBLE'S CALL TO DO JUST THAT REMINDS ME OF THE SAYING THAT CHRISTIANITY HAS NOT BEEN TRIED AND FOUND WANTING , SO MUCH AS IT HAS BEEN FOUND DIFFICULT , AND NOT TRIED . THE CONSISTENT MESSAGE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CALLS US TO RECOGNIZE THAT ALL LIFE IS SACRED BECAUSE ALL HUMAN BEINGS ARE CREATED IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF GOD , A TRUTH RECOGNIZED AS CENTRAL IN THE FOUNDING DOCUMENTS OF OUR NATION . WE HAVE GONE TO WAR TO DEFEND OUR SECURITY AND OUR VALUES , AND THAT IS AN ENTERPRISE THAT ALWAYS INVOLVES MORALLY HAZARDOUS ACTIONS . IT IS A JUST WAR AND LIKE ALL WARS IT REQUIRES THE SACRIFICE AND TAKING OF HUMAN LIFE . BUT LET US NOT ABANDON OUR HUMILITY IN ITS UNKNOWNWORD . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , NOT THE WORST THING , BUT A TERRIBLE THING NONETHELESS . AND OUR HUMILITY , COMMANDED BY OUR FAITH IN OUR IDEALS AND IN A JUST AND LOVING GOD , GIVES US THE STRENGTH TO RESIST THE UNNECESSARY SACRIFICE OF OUR FAITH IN THE NECESSARY CAUSE OF DEFEATING OUR ENEMIES . WHEN I WAS A YOUNG MAN I THOUGHT GLORY WAS THE HIGHEST AMBITION AND ALL GLORY WAS UNKNOWNWORD . MY PARENTS AND THE NAVAL ACADEMY TRIED TO TEACH ME OTHERWISE BUT IT WASN'T UNTIL I HAD TO RELY ON OTHERS TO AN EXTENT I NEVER THOUGHT WOULD BE NECESSARY THAT I UNDERSTOOD THE LESSON . I HAD TO HAVE FAITH IN SOMETHING GREATER THAN MYSELF NOT ONLY TO SURVIVE BUT TO SURVIVE WITH MY SELF-RESPECT INTACT : FAITH IN MY COMRADES ; FAITH IN MY COUNTRY ; AND FAITH IN MY GOD . THAT FAITH HELPED ME NOT ONLY TO ENDURE BUT TO UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT THE VALUES IT ENCOMPASSED . AND , THUS , IN A MOMENT OF UNEXPECTED COMPASSION THAT GOD ORDAINED , I COULD LEARN THE MOST VALUABLE LESSON OF ALL : HOW TO FORGIVE AND TO ESCAPE THE BITTERNESS THAT COULD HAVE DESTROYED MY LIFE . IF AMERICA STANDS FOR ANYTHING , IT STANDS FOR THE FREEDOM TO FOLLOW OUR OWN HEARTS , TO DETERMINE OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD . OUR CONSTITUTION DID NOT ESTABLISH A NATIONAL RELIGION BUT NEITHER DID IT BANISH ANY WORSHIP . RELIGIOUS FREEDOM DOES NOT REQUIRE AMERICANS TO HIDE THEIR FAITH FROM PUBLIC VIEW OR THAT COMMUNITIES MUST REFRAIN FROM PUBLICLY ACKNOWLEDGING THE IMPORTANCE TO THEM OF FAITH . WE ARE ONLY ABJURED FROM USING THE LAW TO MAKE THOSE WHO DO NOT WISH TO ADHERE TO THE CREED THAT WE EMBRACE . JUDGES SHOULD NOT LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH AND ACTUALLY RESTRICT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM BY BANNING ITS EXPRESSION IN THE PUBLIC SQUARE . WISDOM IS A VIRTUE . SOMETIMES ALL WISDOM ASKS OF US IS THAT WE RECOGNIZE COMMON SENSE . DON'T FEDERALIZE ISSUES NOT ADDRESSED IN THE CONSTITUTION . DON'T CONSTITUTIONALIZE ISSUES WHERE FEDERALISM HAS A CHANCE TO WORK . BUT SOMETIMES , WISDOM , AS DO ALL OTHER VIRTUES , REQUIRES COURAGE . WISDOM SUGGESTS WE SHOULD BE RELUCTANT TO CHANGE A DEFINITION OF MARRIAGE THAT HAS EXISTED FOR THOUSANDS OF YEARS , BUT IT TAKES COURAGE IN THIS DAY AND AGE TO INSIST THAT A MOTHER AND A FATHER HAVE UNIQUE AND COMPLEMENTARY ROLES IN THE RAISING OF CHILDREN , AND THAT MARRIAGE UNKNOWNWORD PUBLIC SUPPORT FOR THOSE ROLES . WISDOM SUGGESTS THAT WE SHOULD BE WILLING TO GIVE AN UNBORN CHILD THE SAME CHANCE THAT OUR PARENTS GAVE US , BUT IT TAKES COURAGE IN THIS POLITICAL CLIMATE TO INSIST ON THE PROTECTION OF UNBORN CHILDREN WHO CAN'T VOTE , HAVE NO VOICE , AND CAN'T REWARD YOU WITH SUPPORT AND DONATIONS . WISDOM SUGGESTS THAT WHEN ACTIVIST FEDERAL JUDGES IMPOSE THEIR SOCIAL VIEWS ON THE CITIZENS OF EVERY STATE , THE RESULT IS GOING TO DISTORT OUR POLITICS IN TERRIBLE WAYS , BUT IT TAKES COURAGE TO INSIST THAT THE COURTS HAVE TO RETURN TO THEIR PROPER ROLE . I WILL APPOINT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JUDGES THAT WON'T LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH . I HAVE BEEN PRO-LIFE MY ENTIRE PUBLIC CAREER . I BELIEVE I AM THE ONLY MAJOR CANDIDATE IN EITHER PARTY WHO CAN MAKE THAT CLAIM . I AM PRO-LIFE BECAUSE I KNOW WHAT IT IS LIKE TO LIVE WITHOUT HUMAN RIGHTS , WHERE HUMAN LIFE IS ACCORDED NO INHERENT VALUE , AND I KNOW THAT I HAVE A PERSONAL OBLIGATION TO ADVOCATE HUMAN RIGHTS WHEREVER THEY ARE DENIED : IN BOSNIA OR BURMA , IN CUBA OR THE MIDDLE EAST ; AND IN OUR OWN COUNTRY WHEN WE FAIL TO RESPECT THE INHERENT DIGNITY OF ALL HUMAN LIFE , BORN OR UNBORN . THAT IS A PERSONAL TESTAMENT , WHICH YOU NEED NOT TAKE ON FAITH . YOU NEED ONLY EXAMINE MY PUBLIC RECORD TO KNOW THAT I WON'T EVER CHANGE MY POSITION TO FIT THE POLITICS OF THE DAY . HUMILITY IS AS IMPORTANT AS WISDOM IN OUR PUBLIC AFFAIRS . IT NOT ONLY ASSURES OUR FIDELITY TO A CAUSE GREATER THAN OURSELVES -- THE DEFENSE OF OUR IDEALS -- BUT CAUTIONS US NOT TO BECOME SO COMPLACENT IN OUR STRENGTH AND VIRTUE THAT WE BECOME ARROGANT IN POWER . THIS IS SOMETHING THAT AMERICANS HAVE LONG UNDERSTOOD AND MUST CONTINUE TO UNDERSTAND . WE MUST PRESERVE ROOM FOR ECONOMIC FREEDOM , BUT RECOGNIZE THE POSSIBILITY OF CORRUPTION . WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT GOVERNMENT IS NECESSARY , BUT POWER CORRUPTS . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . WE MUST RESTORE THAT TRUST BY DOING WHAT IS RIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND NOT JUST FOR THE SPECIAL INTERESTS . RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT "FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS . IT IS THE CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION OF THE MARKETPLACE . IT IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE SHORTCOMINGS AND SEEK SOLUTIONS ." HE SPOKE THESE WORDS TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN MOSCOW IN 1988 . IT WAS A MESSAGE THEY NEEDED TO HEAR IN RUSSIA THEN , AND IT IS A MESSAGE THAT WE NEED TO HEED IN WASHINGTON NOW . PRESIDENT REAGAN POSSESSED AN UNSHAKEABLE FAITH IN AMERICA'S SPIRIT THAT WAS MORE DURABLE THAN THE PREVAILING POLITICAL SENTIMENTS OF HIS TIME , AND HE BECAME PRESIDENT TO PROVE IT . HIS CONFIDENCE WAS A TONIC TO MEN WHO HAD COME HOME EAGER TO PUT THE VIETNAM WAR BEHIND US AND FOR OUR COUNTRY TO DO LIKEWISE . HIS WAS A FAITH THAT SHOUTED TO TYRANTS , UNKNOWNWORD DOWN THIS WALL ." AND WHEN WALLS WERE ALL I HAD FOR A WORLD , HIS FAITH IN OUR COUNTRY GAVE ME HOPE IN A DESOLATE PLACE . IT WAS THE FAITH HE SHARED WITH MY FRIEND , MIKE CHRISTIAN , A HUMBLE AND WISE AMERICAN , TO WHOM I WILL ALWAYS REMAIN INDEBTED . MY FRIENDS , WE CAN ACHIEVE WHATEVER TASK WE SET FOR OUR COUNTRY . I HONOR RONALD REAGAN'S AND MIKE UNKNOWNWORD FAITH IN AMERICA , THE GREATEST NATION AND GREATEST FORCE FOR GOOD ON EARTH . IF WE REMEMBER THAT THEN ALL WILL BE WELL FOR THE VALUES WE HOLD DEAR AND FOR OUR COUNTRY . THESE ARE CRITICAL TIMES FOR THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY , THE STRENGTH OF OUR ECONOMY , AND THE FUTURE OF OUR COURTS . THIS IS NOT THE TIME TO TURN OUR BACK ON THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER MOST . THE VOTERS WHO HAVE OFFERED THEIR SUPPORT TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY FOR DECADES DESERVE THE CHANCE TO UNIFY AROUND A CANDIDATE WHO HAS DEMONSTRATED A CONSISTENT COMMITMENT TO THE VALUES THAT ARE THE REASON FOR THAT SUPPORT . I WOULD LIKE TO BE THAT CANDIDATE . I HAVE A RECORD THAT CAN BE TRUSTED . I HAVE THE EXPERIENCE TO LEAD FROM DAY ONE , AND I AM COMMITTED TO VICTORY IN THE RACE AHEAD . THANK YOU FOR THE SUPPORT YOU'VE OFFERED TO ME AND TO THE REPUBLICAN PARTY OVER THE YEARS , AND FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TODAY TO EARN THAT SUPPORT ONE MORE TIME . THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU .
RED	THANK YOU FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK TODAY ABOUT THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . YOU DON'T HAVE TO BE A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT TO DISCOVER THAT WORRIES OVER THE AVAILABILITY AND COST OF HEALTH CARE TROUBLE THE WAKING HOURS AND UNKNOWNWORD THE SLEEP OF MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER SINGLE DOMESTIC ISSUE . INDEED , OUTSIDE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGE OF OUR TIME - THE THREAT OF ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS - NO ISSUE COMES UP MORE UNKNOWNWORD IN LARGE AND SMALL PUBLIC DISCUSSIONS , IN POLLS , DEBATES AND MEDIA REPORTS . SO IT IS SURELY APPROPRIATE THAT THE SUBJECT FIGURES PROMINENTLY IN THIS PRESIDENTIAL ELECTION . AND IN OUR EAGERNESS TO APPEAR RESPONSIVE TO THIS UNKNOWNWORD PUBLIC CONCERN , EVERY CANDIDATE WILL FEEL COMPELLED TO OFFER HIS OR HER "SOLUTION " TO THE PROBLEM . BUT WILL THESE SOLUTIONS ACTUALLY IMPROVE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ? OR WILL THEY MERELY SERVE AS THE CANDIDATES ' OPENING ANTE IN WHAT LOOKS TO BECOME A BIDDING WAR ? IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD WILL WE PROMISE MORE THAN WE CAN DELIVER ? WILL WE MISDIAGNOSE THE PROBLEM AND DEVISE A CURE THAT WILL KILL THE PATIENT ? WILL WE EVEN ASK OURSELVES THAT FIRST , MOST IMPORTANT OF QUESTIONS : WHAT EXACTLY IS THE PROBLEM WITH THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM ? THE PROBLEM , MY FRIENDS , IS NOT THAT AMERICANS DON'T HAVE FINE DOCTORS , MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY AND TREATMENTS . THE STATE OF OUR MEDICAL SCIENCE IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD . THE PROBLEM IS NOT THAT MOST AMERICANS LACK ADEQUATE HEALTH INSURANCE . THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS HAVE PRIVATE INSURANCE AND OUR GOVERNMENT SPENDS BILLIONS EACH YEAR TO PROVIDE EVEN MORE . THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WITH THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS THAT IT COSTS TOO MUCH , AND THE WAY INFLATIONARY PRESSURES ARE ACTUALLY BUILT INTO IT . BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES PAY MORE AND MORE EVERY YEAR TO GET WHAT THEY OFTEN CONSIDER TO BE INADEQUATE ATTENTION OR POOR CARE . AND THOSE WHO WANT TO BUY INSURANCE ARE OFTEN UNABLE TO BECAUSE OF THE HIGH COST . WHAT MORE COMPELLING EVIDENCE OF THE PROBLEM DO WE NEED THAN TO NOTE THAT GENERAL MOTORS NOW SPENDS MORE FOR HEALTH CARE OF ITS EMPLOYEES AND RETIREES THAN FOR THE MATERIAL REQUIRED TO MANUFACTURE ITS PRODUCTS - STEEL . THE PRICE OF EVERY GM CAR INCLUDES OVER $1500 FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS COMPARED TO TOYOTA WHOSE TOTAL COST FOR HEALTHCARE PER CAR IS ABOUT $200 . THE GROWTH OF COSTS AFFECTS EVERYONE : GOVERNMENT OVERSPENDING , BUSINESS COSTS AND FAMILY BUDGETS . IT HURTS THOSE WHO HAVE INSURANCE BY MAKING IT MORE EXPENSIVE TO KEEP . AND IT HURTS THOSE WHO DON'T HAVE INSURANCE BY MAKING IT EVEN HARDER TO ATTAIN . WE ARE APPROACHING A "PERFECT STORM " OF PROBLEMS THAT IF NOT ADDRESSED BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT , WILL CAUSE OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO IMPLODE . HERE IS WHAT WE KNOW : FIRST , WE CURRENTLY SPEND 2.2 TRILLION DOLLARS-16 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR WE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE . BY 2015 , JUST SEVEN YEARS FROM NOW , THAT NUMBER WILL NEARLY DOUBLE TO FOUR TRILLION DOLLARS . SECOND , BY 2019 MEDICARE WILL BE BROKE . WE ARE CURRENTLY SPENDING MORE ON MEDICARE THAN WE ARE COLLECTING IN PAYROLL TAXES AND CASHING IN THE FEW IOU'S LEFT IN THE TRUST FUND . IN THE MEANTIME , MORE AND MORE OF OUR RETIREES ' SOCIAL SECURITY CHECKS WILL ALSO GO TO PAY FOR MEDICARE LEAVING OUR SENIORS WITH LESS MONEY FOR THEIR EVERYDAY EXPENSES . THIRD , BY 2017 MORE MONEY WILL BE GOING OUT OF SOCIAL SECURITY THAN IS COMING IN . THE NEXT PRESIDENT MUST ACT TO AVERT THE IMPENDING "STORM ." FOR ALL THE GRANDIOSE PROMISES MADE IN THIS CAMPAIGN , HAS ANY CANDIDATE SPOKEN HONESTLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ABOUT THE GOVERNMENT'S ROLE AND FAILINGS ABOUT INDIVIDUAL RESPONSIBILITIES ? HAS ANY CANDIDATE TOLD THE TRUTH ABOUT THE FUTURE OF MEDICARE ? ITS COSTS ARE GROWING ASTRONOMICALLY FASTER THAN ITS FINANCING , AND LEAVING ITS STRUCTURAL FLAWS UNADDRESSED WILL HASTEN ITS BANKRUPTCY . HAS ANY CANDIDATE WARNED THAT WE HAVE A PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN ? YET THAT IS THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT MANY CHRONIC DISEASES . HAS ANY CANDIDATE INSISTED THAT GENUINE AND EFFECTIVE HEALTH CARE REFORM REQUIRES ACCOUNTABILITY FROM EVERYONE : DRUG COMPANIES , INSURANCE COMPANIES , DOCTORS , HOSPITALS , THE GOVERNMENT AND PATIENTS ? YET THAT IS THE TRUTH UPON WHICH ANY SO-CALLED SOLUTION MUST BE BASED . DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES ARE NOT TELLING YOU THESE TRUTHS . THEY OFFER THEIR USUAL DEFAULT POSITION : IF THE GOVERNMENT WOULD ONLY PAY FOR INSURANCE EVERYTHING WOULD BE FINE . THEY PROMISE UNIVERSAL COVERAGE , WHATEVER ITS COST , AND THE MASSIVE TAX INCREASES , MANDATES AND GOVERNMENT REGULATION THAT IT IMPOSES . I OFFER A UNKNOWNWORD CONSERVATIVE VISION FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM , WHICH PRESERVES THE MOST ESSENTIAL VALUE OF AMERICAN LIVES - FREEDOM . CONSERVATIVES BELIEVE IN THE PURSUIT OF PERSONAL , POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC FREEDOM FOR EVERYONE . WE BELIEVE THAT FREE PEOPLE MAY VOLUNTARILY UNITE , BUT CANNOT BE COMPELLED TO DO SO , AND THAT THE LIMITED GOVERNMENT THAT RESULTS BEST PROTECTS OUR INDIVIDUAL FREEDOM . IN HEALTH CARE , WE BELIEVE IN ENHANCING THE FREEDOM OF INDIVIDUALS TO RECEIVE NECESSARY AND DESIRED CARE . WE DO NOT BELIEVE IN COERCION AND THE USE OF STATE POWER TO MANDATE CARE , COVERAGE OR COSTS . I BELIEVE AMERICANS WANT TO BE PART OF A SYSTEM THAT OFFERS HIGH QUALITY CARE ; THAT RESPECTS THEIR INDIVIDUAL DIGNITY AND IS AVAILABLE AT REASONABLE COST . UNFORTUNATELY , THE AMERICAN HEALTH CARE SYSTEM AS IT IS CURRENTLY STRUCTURED FAILS THIS TEST . IT IS TOO EXPENSIVE . IT INSULTS OUR COMMON SENSE AND DIGNITY WITH EXCESSIVE PAPERWORK , UNKNOWNWORD VISITS WITH TOO MANY SPECIALISTS , AND BY UNKNOWNWORD HIDING FROM US ANY CLEAR IDEA OF WHAT WE ARE GETTING FOR OUR MONEY . WE MUST REFORM THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM TO MAKE IT RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES . NOT THE GOVERNMENT . NOT THE INSURANCE COMPANIES . NOT TORT LAWYERS . NOT EVEN THE DOCTORS AND HOSPITALS . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO TAKE ON THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT THRIVE IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . DOCTORS MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF MANAGING OUR CARE AND KEEPING US HEALTHY AND OUT OF HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES . WE WILL NEED ALTERNATIVES TO DOCTORS ' OFFICES AND EMERGENCY ROOMS . HOSPITALS MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF TAKING CARE OF US WHEN WE ARE THERE , COMMIT FAR FEWER DEADLY AND COSTLY MEDICAL ERRORS AND UNKNOWNWORD OPERATE MORE EFFICIENTLY . PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES MUST WORRY LESS ABOUT SQUEEZING ADDITIONAL PROFITS FROM OLD MEDICINES BY COPYING THE LAST SUCCESSFUL DRUG AND INSISTING ON ADDITIONAL PATENT PROTECTIONS AND FOCUS MORE ON NEW AND INNOVATIVE MEDICINE . INSURANCE COMPANIES SHOULD SPEND MORE ON MEDICAL CARE AND LESS ON "ADMINISTRATION ." MY REFORMS ARE BUILT ON THE PURSUIT OF THREE GOALS : PAYING ONLY FOR QUALITY MEDICAL CARE , HAVING INSURANCE CHOICES THAT ARE DIVERSE AND RESPONSIVE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS , AND RESTORING OUR SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY . THESE REFORMS ARE ALSO BUILT ON THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OF MEDICAL TENETS : DO NO HARM . THERE IS MUCH TO BE ADMIRED ABOUT MEDICINE IN AMERICA , AND I WANT TO PROTECT THOSE QUALITIES . DOCTORS AND OTHER PROVIDERS WANT TO PROVIDE QUALITY CARE . LOWER COSTS MEAN THAT MEDICARE PREMIUMS DON'T CONTINUE TO UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND OUR ABILITY TO SUSTAIN IT , AND OUR INSURANCE PREMIUMS ARE STRETCHED FARTHER . MOST IMPORTANTLY , ANY REFORM MUST RESPECT THE FREEDOM TO KEEP YOUR CARE AND INSURANCE JUST AS THEY ARE . THE FIRST PRINCIPAL OF REAL REFORM IS THAT AMERICANS SHOULD PAY ONLY FOR QUALITY . RIGHT NOW , TOO MUCH OF THE SYSTEM IS BUILT ON GETTING PAID JUST FOR PROVIDING SERVICES , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THOSE SERVICES ARE NECESSARY OR PRODUCE QUALITY CARE AND OUTCOMES . AMERICAN FAMILIES SHOULD ONLY PAY FOR GETTING THE RIGHT CARE : CARE THAT IS INTENDED TO IMPROVE THEIR HEALTH . AMERICAN FAMILIES KNOW QUALITY WHEN THEY SEE IT , SO THEIR DOLLARS SHOULD BE IN THEIR HANDS . WHEN FAMILIES ARE INFORMED ABOUT MEDICAL CHOICES , THEY ARE MORE CAPABLE OF MAKING THEIR OWN DECISIONS , LESS LIKELY TO CHOOSE THE MOST EXPENSIVE AND OFTEN UNNECESSARY OPTIONS , AND ARE MORE SATISFIED WITH THEIR CHOICES . HEALTH SAVINGS ACCOUNTS ARE TAX-PREFERRED ACCOUNTS USED TO PAY INSURANCE PREMIUMS AND OTHER HEALTH COSTS . THEY PUT THE FAMILY IN CHARGE OF WHAT THEY PAY FOR , AND SHOULD BE EXPANDED AND ENCOURAGED . I AM COMMITTED TO ENSURING THE FINEST QUALITY MEDICAL CARE FOR OUR VETERANS . THEY HAVE EARNED THAT CONSIDERATION AND MORE . THEY SHOULD NOT HAVE TO WAIT FOR ACCESS TO A VA FACILITY THAT IS HOURS AWAY . WE CAN GIVE THEM THE OPTION TO PUT THE MEANS FOR FINANCING THEIR CARE UNDER THEIR CONTROL - IN AN ELECTRONIC CARD OR OTHER DEVICE - SO THAT IF THEY WANT THEY CAN CHOOSE THEIR CARE IN ANOTHER WAY THAT SUITS THEM BEST . WE CANNOT LET THE SEARCH FOR HIGH-QUALITY CARE BE DERAILED BY FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS AND EXCESSIVE DAMAGE AWARDS . WE MUST PASS MEDICAL LIABILITY REFORM , AND THOSE REFORMS SHOULD ELIMINATE LAWSUITS FOR DOCTORS THAT FOLLOW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND ADHERE TO PATIENT SAFETY PROTOCOLS . IF THE DEMOCRATS ARE SINCERE IN THEIR CONVICTION THAT HEALTH CARE COVERAGE AND QUALITY IS THEIR FIRST PRIORITY , THAN THEY WILL PUT THE NEEDS OF PATIENTS BEFORE THE DEMANDS OF TRIAL LAWYERS . BUT THEY CAN'T HAVE IT BOTH WAYS . RESEARCH SHOWS THAT COORDINATED CARE - PROVIDERS COLLABORATING TO PRODUCE THE BEST HEALTH OUTCOME - OFFERS BETTER QUALITY AND COSTS LESS . WE SHOULD PAY A SINGLE BILL FOR HIGH-QUALITY HEART CARE , NOT AN ENDLESS SERIES OF BILLS FOR PRE-SURGICAL TESTS AND VISITS , UNKNOWNWORD AND SURGERY , AND FOLLOW-UP TESTS , DRUGS AND OFFICE VISITS . PAYING FOR COORDINATED CARE MEANS THAT EVERY SINGLE PROVIDER IS NOW UNITED ON BEING RESPONSIVE TO THE NEEDS OF A SINGLE PERSON : THE PATIENT . HEALTH INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY WILL FLOURISH BECAUSE THE MARKET WILL DEMAND IT . CLINICS , HOSPITALS , DOCTORS , MEDICAL TECHNOLOGY PRODUCERS , DRUG COMPANIES AND EVERY OTHER PROVIDER OF HEALTH CARE MUST BE ACCOUNTABLE AND THEIR TRANSACTIONS UNKNOWNWORD . FAMILIES , INSURANCE COMPANIES , THE GOVERNMENT - WHOEVER IS PAYING THE BILL - MUST UNDERSTAND EXACTLY WHAT THEIR CARE COSTS AND THE OUTCOME THEY RECEIVED . FAMILIES PLACE A HIGH VALUE ON QUICKLY GETTING SIMPLE CARE , AND HAVE SHOWN A WILLINGNESS TO PAY UNKNOWNWORD TO GET IT . IF WALK-IN CLINICS IN RETAIL OUTLETS ARE THE MOST CONVENIENT , COST-EFFECTIVE WAY FOR FAMILIES TO SAFELY MEET SIMPLE NEEDS WHY SHOULD GOVERNMENT STAND IN THEIR WAY ? I WILL NOT . IF THE CHEAPEST WAY TO GET HIGH QUALITY CARE IS TO USE ADVANCES IN WEB TECHNOLOGY TO ALLOW A DOCTOR TO PRACTICE ACROSS STATE LINES , THEN LET THEM . IN DISASTERS LIKE KATRINA WE SAW HOW STUPID AND HARMFUL IT IS TO REFUSE THE SERVICES OF DOCTORS JUST BECAUSE THEY HAD AN OUT-OF-STATE ADDRESS . WE SHOULD HAVE A NATIONAL MARKET PLACE , AND IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , WE WILL . DRUGS ARE AN IMPORTANT PART OF MEDICINE , OF COURSE , AND ARE OFTEN QUITE EXPENSIVE . HERE IN IOWA THE ATTORNEY GENERAL IS SUING SEVENTY-EIGHT DRUG COMPANIES ACCUSING THEM OF INFLATING DRUG COSTS PAID BY IOWA TAXPAYERS THROUGH THE MEDICAID SYSTEM . PROBLEMS WITH COSTS ARE CREATED WHEN MARKET FORCES ARE REPLACED BY GOVERNMENT REGULATED PRICES . IF DRUG COSTS REFLECTS VALUE , FINE . BUT IF THERE ARE WAYS TO BRING GREATER COMPETITION TO OUR DRUG MARKETS BY SAFE RE-IMPORTATION OF DRUGS , BY FASTER INTRODUCTION OF GENERIC DRUGS , OR BY ANY OTHER MEANS WE SHOULD DO SO . IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , WE WILL . GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS SUCH AS MEDICARE AND MEDICAID SHOULD LEAD THE WAY IN HEALTH CARE REFORMS THAT IMPROVE QUALITY AND LOWER COSTS . LIKE MOST OF OUR SYSTEM , MEDICARE UNKNOWNWORD NOW REWARDS INSTITUTIONS AND CLINICIANS WHO PROVIDE MORE AND MORE COMPLEX SERVICES . WE NEED TO CHANGE THE WAY PROVIDERS ARE PAID TO FOCUS THEIR ATTENTION MORE ON CHRONIC DISEASE AND MANAGING THEIR TREATMENT . THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT CARE AND EXPENSE FOR AN AGING POPULATION . AND IN A SYSTEM THAT REWARDS QUALITY , MEDICARE SHOULD NOT PAY FOR PREVENTABLE MEDICAL ERRORS . I AM APPRECIATIVE OF THE THERAPEUTIC BENEFITS OF MODERN PHARMACEUTICALS . HOWEVER , I STRONGLY OPPOSED ADDING ANOTHER UNFUNDED ENTITLEMENT TO THE FISCAL TRAIN WRECK THAT IS MEDICARE BY PROVIDING ALL SENIORS WITH A COSTLY DRUG BENEFIT , EVEN THOSE , LIKE ME , WHO CAN MORE THAN AFFORD TO PAY FOR THEIR MEDICINE . THE SECOND PRINCIPLE OF EFFECTIVE REFORM IS TO HAVE INSURANCE CHOICES SO VARIED AND RESPONSIVE TO INDIVIDUAL NEEDS THAT YOU COULD FIRE YOUR INSURANCE COMPANY IF YOU WANTED TO . RIGHT NOW , TOO MANY OF OUR CITIZENS DON'T HAVE AN INSURANCE POLICY AT ALL , AND THOSE WHO DO ARE AFRAID THEY WILL LOSE THE ONE THEY HAVE - AFRAID THEY WILL GET TOO SICK , AFRAID TO STAY HOME AND NOT WORK FULL-TIME , AND AFRAID THEIR BENEFITS WILL DISAPPEAR ALONG WITH THEIR JOB . I BELIEVE THAT EVERYONE SHOULD GET A TAX CREDIT OF $2500 , UNKNOWNWORD FOR FAMILIES , IF THEY HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE . IT IS GOOD TAX POLICY TO TAKE AWAY THE UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD GIVING WORKERS BENEFITS INSTEAD OF WAGES . IT IS GOOD HEALTH POLICY TO REWARD HAVING INSURANCE NO MATTER WHERE YOUR POLICY COMES FROM . TO USE THEIR MONEY EFFECTIVELY , AMERICANS NEED MORE CHOICES . WE SHOULD GIVE ADDITIONAL HELP TO THOSE WHO FACE PARTICULARLY EXPENSIVE CARE . IF IT IS DONE RIGHT AND THE ADDITIONAL MONEY IS THERE , INSURANCE COMPANIES WILL COMPETE FOR THESE PATIENTS - NOT TURN THEM AWAY . IT IS A CHALLENGE TO DEVELOP TECHNIQUES THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE RIGHT AMOUNT TO EACH OF THESE FAMILIES . I PROPOSE THAT WE TRY A UNKNOWNWORD APPROACH AND LET THE STATES WORK ON WHATEVER METHOD THEY FIND MOST PROMISING . THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT CAN HELP FUND THIS EFFORT , BUT IN EXCHANGE , STATES SHOULD ALLOW MEDICAID AND SCHIP FUNDS TO BE USED FOR PRIVATE INSURANCE AND DEVELOP UNKNOWNWORD TO AUGMENT MEDICAID AND TAX CREDITS FOR MORE EXPENSIVE CARE . FAMILY-BASED POLICIES TRANSLATE INTO BROAD SUCCESS WHEN THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD WITH GREATER COMPETITION AMONG INSURERS ON A LEVEL PLAYING FIELD . YOU SHOULD BE ABLE TO BUY YOUR INSURANCE FROM ANY WILLING PROVIDER - THE STATE BUREAUCRACIES ARE NO BETTER THAN NATIONAL ONES . NATIONWIDE INSURANCE MARKETS THAT ENSURE BROAD AND VIGOROUS COMPETITION WILL WRING OUT EXCESS COSTS , UNKNOWNWORD , AND BLOATED EXECUTIVE COMPENSATION . INTRODUCING COMPETITION INTO THE HEALTH INSURANCE MARKET WILL REDUCE COSTS . SOME ARE ALREADY CONTENT WITH THE CHOICES AND ADVICE OFFERED BY THEIR EMPLOYER . FINE . BUT AMERICANS SHOULD BE ABLE TO CHOOSE WHO THEY TRUST . IF A CHURCH OR PROFESSIONAL ORGANIZATION WISHES TO SPONSOR INSURANCE FOR ITS MEMBERS , THEY SHOULD BE ABLE TO DO SO . WHEN AN AMERICAN FAMILY CONTROLS ITS OWN HEALTH CARE FINANCING , HAS A UNKNOWNWORD VARIETY OF LOW-COST , INNOVATIVE CHOICES , AND RECEIVES INSURANCE THROUGH A SPONSOR THEY TRUST , INSURANCE POLICIES WILL ONLY DISAPPEAR WHEN THE FAMILY DECIDES IT DOESN'T SERVE THEM AS WELL AS A COMPETITOR WOULD . THE FINAL IMPORTANT PRINCIPLE OF REFORM IS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY . WE MUST PERSONALLY DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO PREVENT EXPENSIVE , CHRONIC DISEASES . OUR RIGHTS IN THIS COUNTRY ARE PROTECTED BY OUR PERSONAL SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR OWN WELL BEING . CASES OF DIABETES ARE GOING UP , NOT ONLY IN THE BABY BOOM GENERATION , BUT AMONG YOUNGER AMERICANS OBESITY , DIABETES AND HIGH BLOOD PRESSURE ARE ALL ON THE RISE . PARENTS WHO DON'T IMPART TO THEIR CHILDREN A SENSE OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR HEALTH , UNKNOWNWORD AND EXERCISE - VITAL QUALITY OF LIFE INFORMATION THAT POLITICAL CORRECTNESS HAS UNKNOWNWORD FROM OUR SCHOOLS - HAVE FAILED THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . ALSO , PARENTS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR ENSURING THAT THEIR CHILDREN ARE COVERED HEALTH INSURANCE IF , AS IS OFTEN THE CASE , MANY OPTIONS ARE ALREADY AVAILABLE TO THEM . WE CAN BUILD A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT IS MORE RESPONSIVE TO OUR NEEDS AND IS DELIVERED TO MORE PEOPLE AT LOWER COST . THE "SOLUTION ," MY FRIENDS , ISN'T A UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT TAKEOVER OF HEALTH CARE . IT RESIDES WHERE EVERY IMPORTANT SOCIAL ADVANCE HAS ALWAYS RESIDED - WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THEMSELVES , WITH WELL INFORMED AMERICAN FAMILIES , MAKING PRACTICAL DECISIONS TO ADDRESS THEIR IMPERATIVES FOR BETTER HEALTH AND MORE SECURE PROSPERITY . THE ENGINE OF OUR PROSPERITY AND PROGRESS HAS ALWAYS BEEN OUR FREEDOM AND THE SENSE OF RESPONSIBILITY FOR AND CONTROL OF OUR OWN DESTINY THAT FREEDOM REQUIRES . THE PUBLIC'S TRUST IN GOVERNMENT WAXES AND UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE HAVE ALWAYS TRUSTED IN OURSELVES TO MEET ANY CHALLENGE THAT REQUIRED ONLY OUR INGENUITY AND INDUSTRY TO UNKNOWNWORD . ANY "SOLUTION " THAT ROBS US OF THAT ESSENTIAL SENSE OF OURSELVES IS A CURE FAR WORSE THAN THE AFFLICTION IT IS MEANT TO TREAT .
RED	THANK YOU . IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE THE GUEST OF SUCH AN UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC CLUB . SINCE ADAM SMITH COINED THE PHRASE "THE INVISIBLE HAND ," ECONOMISTS , PHILOSOPHERS , AND OTHERS HAVE DEBATED THE VIRTUES OF MARKET ECONOMIES . YOU'LL EVEN HEAR SOME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CLAIMING TO UNDERSTAND THE FINER NUANCES OF MARKETS AND MANAGEMENT . IN FACT , SUCCESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FANCY THEORY . THE SIMPLE LESSON OF HISTORY IS THAT THERE IS NO ECONOMIC FORCE ON THIS GLOBE THAT IS STRONGER THAN FREE PEOPLE AND THEIR DESIRE TO CREATE A BETTER LIFE . RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT "FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS . IT IS THE CONTINUING REVOLUTION OF THE MARKETPLACE . IT IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE SHORTCOMINGS AND SEEK SOLUTIONS ." HE SPOKE THESE WORDS TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN MOSCOW IN 1988 . THOSE STUDENTS THIRSTED FOR FREEDOM . WE ARE BLESSED BY FREEDOM , BUT THE IMPORTANCE OF PROTECTING IT IN EVERY REALM IS A MESSAGE THAT POLITICIANS DESPERATELY NEED TO HEAR TODAY . UNFORTUNATELY , WE FIND OURSELVES AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S . ECONOMY IS GROWING MORE SLOWLY THAN ANYONE WOULD LIKE . AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE , CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN ARE EVEN TOUGHER , WITH THE STATE SUFFERING THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR II . TOUGH TIMES CAN BREED FEAR , AND HILLARY CLINTON AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING THOSE FEARS TO PUSH AN AGENDA THAT IS TIRED , DANGEROUS , AND WILL ROB US OF ECONOMIC FREEDOM . ONCE AGAIN , THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE OUR CHOICES FOR US - NOT RESPECT OUR DREAMS , AND TRUST OUR DECISIONS ON HOW BEST TO SEIZE OUR OPPORTUNITIES . LET'S TAKE STOCK OF THE SITUATION TODAY IN MICHIGAN . UNEMPLOYMENT IS UNDER FIVE PERCENT NATIONWIDE , BUT OVER SEVEN PERCENT IN MICHIGAN . TEN PERCENT OF MICHIGAN'S JOBS HAVE DISAPPEARED THIS DECADE AND 50,000 PEOPLE LEFT THE STATE IN THE PAST YEAR . WHAT DOES THE DEMOCRATIC GOVERNOR PROPOSE TO DO ? RAISE TAXES ! NOW THAT WILL HELP . MICHIGAN BUSINESSES ALREADY STRUGGLE AGAINST AN UNFAVORABLE COST STRUCTURE , AND HIGHER TAXES WILL ONLY MAKE THOSE PROBLEMS WORSE . HIGHER TAXES DISCOURAGE ENTREPRENEURSHIP , FOSTER WASTEFUL TAX-PLANNING , INHIBIT ECONOMIC FREEDOM AND SLOW LONG-TERM GROWTH . I WILL NOT LET THE DEMOCRATS ROLL BACK THE BUSH TAX CUTS . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD PROTECT THE AMERICAN FAMILY AGAINST PARTISAN TAX INCREASES BY REQUIRING A THREE-FIFTHS MAJORITY IN CONGRESS TO RAISE TAXES . BUT THAT IS JUST A START . OUR TAX CODE IS SO COMPLICATED IT EXTRACTS ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY , A TOTAL OF OVER $140 BILLION IN EXTRA COSTS EVERY YEAR . IT'S OFFENSIVE THAT SIX OUT OF EVERY TEN TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE ELSE JUST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT . I WANT AMERICA'S SMARTEST PEOPLE CREATING JOBS , NOT WASTING THEIR TIME , ENERGY AND CAPITAL NAVIGATING OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE TAX LAWS . NOW , HAVING ONE INCOME TAX SYSTEM LIKE THIS IS BAD ENOUGH - BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO OF THEM . WE CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TWO SEPARATE TAX SYSTEMS . THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IS EXPECTED TO HIT UP TO 30 MILLION PEOPLE BY 2010 . I AM COMMITTED TO REPEALING THIS TAX BEFORE MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO DEVOTE EVEN MORE OF THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY TO PAYING FOR THE SPENDING LARGESSE IN WASHINGTON . WE CAN HAVE A SINGLE , FAIR AND SIMPLER SYSTEM BUILT ON A FEW , LOWER TAX RATES AND STRAIGHTFORWARD CREDITS FOR WORK , HEALTH , EDUCATION , AND THOSE WITH A FAMILY . WE CAN MAKE OUR PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TAX SYSTEMS WORK COHESIVELY SO THAT WE CAN SHED OUR STATUS AS ONE OF THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE TAX JURISDICTIONS ON EARTH . LET NOBODY BE FOOLED : IF OUR BEST COMPANIES , LARGE OR SMALL , ARE OVERTAXED AND UNCOMPETITIVE , IT IS THE AMERICAN WORKER WHO SUFFERS . NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR DEMOCRATS TO BE THREATENING TO RAISE TAXES - THE ECONOMY IS GROWING TOO SLOWLY AND THE COST OF CAPITAL HAS RISEN ALREADY . NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO RESTORE AMERICAN'S TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT BY CONTROLLING WASTEFUL SPENDING . EVEN IF THERE IS SUCCESS IN KEEPING TAXES LOW , MICHIGAN BUSINESSES - LARGE MULTINATIONAL COMPANIES , SMALL BUSINESS , AND ENTREPRENEURS ALIKE - FACE A TSUNAMI OF RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS . IT IS NO SURPRISE THAT HEALTH CARE FIGURED PROMINENTLY IN THE RECENT AUTO INDUSTRY LABOR DISPUTE . YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE A THREAT TO OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS , A THREAT TO OUR FAMILIES ' BUDGETS , A THREAT TO OUR GOVERNMENT'S SOLVENCY , AND A THREAT TO THE PROFITABILITY OF AMERICAN BUSINESS . I APPLAUD THE RECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE UAW AND GM TO HELP GUARANTEE THE HEALTH BENEFITS OF RETIRED AUTO WORKERS . I'M TOLD THE UNKNOWNWORD TALKS INCLUDE A SIMILAR PROPOSAL TO CREATE A TRUST FUND FOR HEALTH CARE . BUT MY FRIENDS WE MUST DO MORE - WE MUST REIGN IN THE GROWING COST OF CARE IF WE ARE TO COMPETE GLOBALLY . THE AMERICAN WORKER IS THE MOST PRODUCTIVE WORKER IN THE WORLD . THIS IS WHY MANY FOREIGN MANUFACTURERS COME TO THE UNITED STATES TO BUILD THEIR PRODUCTS . BUT , WE MUST BE MORE COMPETITIVE IN ORDER TO SUSTAIN OUR LEADERSHIP IN MANUFACTURING . JAPAN CURRENTLY SPENDS HALF OF WHAT THE U.S . SPENDS ON HEALTH CARE , BUT THEY LIVE LONGER . IT IS INCREDIBLY DIFFICULT TO BE COMPETITIVE IF THE PRICE OF EVERY GM CAR INCLUDES ABOUT $1700 FOR HEALTH CARE COSTS BEFORE THE FIRST WRENCH IS TURNED , MORE THAN THE COST OF THE STEEL IN THE CAR . FOR TOYOTA THE SAME COST IS ABOUT $200 . AMERICA HAS THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD AND WE MUST WORK TO KEEP IT SO , BUT WE MUST ALSO WORK TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES TO CONTROL COSTS AND UNKNOWNWORD MAKE THAT CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE . DEMOCRATS WANT TO TURN HEALTH CARE INTO A GOVERNMENT AGENCY . THAT WILL NOT MEAN LOWER COSTS . IT WILL NOT MEAN HIGHER QUALITY . IT WILL MEAN HIGHER TAXES , LESS CHOICE AND LESS FREEDOM . I WILL BE TALKING MORE ABOUT HEALTH CARE ON THURSDAY , BUT I BELIEVE THE DEBATE MUST FOCUS ON THE COST AND QUALITY OF CARE , OR THESE TRUST FUNDS AND THE COMPANIES SUPPORTING THEM MAY NOT SURVIVE . IT WILL REQUIRE BROAD-BASED CHANGE TO FOCUS ON PATIENTS , MUCH MORE COMPETITION IN THE SYSTEM , AND MORE RESPONSIBILITY OF OUR CITIZENSOR MEDICARE WILL GROW UNSUSTAINABLY , AND MANY GOVERNMENTS AND COMPANIES WILL FIND IT IMPOSSIBLE TO FUND HEALTH CARE . IF WE DON'T GET COSTS UNDER CONTROL , THE NUMBER OF UNINSURED WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND THERE WON'T BE ENOUGH MONEY TO PLUG THE HOLE . WE MUST ADDRESS THIS PROBLEM NOW TO ASSIST THE GROWING GENERATION OF OLDER AMERICANS INCREASINGLY DEPENDENT ON HEALTH CARE AND FOR GENERATIONS TO COME AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL . MICHIGAN'S PROBLEMS GOT WORSE WHEN THE STATE GOVERNMENT NEARLY SHUT DOWN , AND DEMOCRATS REFUSED TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICES NECESSARY TO FOCUS SPENDING ON GENUINE PRIORITIES . IT'S YET ANOTHER SAD EXAMPLE OF WHY ACROSS THIS NATION TAXPAYERS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . POLITICIANS REFUSE TO TALK STRAIGHT ABOUT SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE : THE CURRENT SOCIAL SECURITY SYSTEM IS UNSUSTAINABLE . PERIOD . A HALF CENTURY AGO , SIXTEEN AMERICAN WORKERS SUPPORTED EVERY RETIREE . TODAY , IT'S JUST THREE . SOON , IT WILL BE ONLY TWO . IF WE DON'T MAKE SOME TOUGH CHOICES , SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE EITHER WON'T BE THERE FOR OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN OR WE WILL HAVE HAD TO RAISE TAXES SO DRAMATICALLY TO SUPPORT THEM THAT WE WILL CRUSH THE PROSPERITY OF AVERAGE AMERICANS . I WILL FIGHT TO SAVE THE FUTURE OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE BY REACHING MY HAND ACROSS THE AISLE , BUT IF THE DEMOCRATS WON'T ACT , GIVE ME THE RESPONSIBILITY AND I WILL . IF CONGRESS WON'T ACT , I WILL DEMAND AN UP OR DOWN VOTE ON MY PLAN . NO PROBLEM IS IN MORE NEED OF HONESTY THAN THE LOOMING INSOLVENCY OF OUR ENTITLEMENT PROGRAMS . NO GOVERNMENT PROGRAM IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF MORE POLITICAL POSTURING AND SPIN THAN SOCIAL SECURITY AND MEDICARE . AMERICANS HAVE THE RIGHT TO KNOW THE TRUTH , NO MATTER HOW BAD IT IS . I WON'T LEAVE OFFICE WITHOUT DOING EVERYTHING I CAN TO FIX THE FISCAL PROBLEM THAT , MORE THAN ANY OTHER , THREATENS OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY AND POWER . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO RESTORE THE TRUST OF TAXPAYERS IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT TO SPEND THEIR HARD EARNED MONEY WISELY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . WHEN CONGRESS SENDS A PORK-LADEN SPENDING BILL TO MY DESK , I WILL VETO IT . THE CONGRESS JUST SENT TO THE PRESIDENT A WATER RESOURCES AND DEVELOPMENT ACT WITH 900 EARMARK PROJECTS . IF I GOT THAT BILL , I'D PULL OUT THIS PEN , A PEN GIVEN TO ME BY A GREAT PRESIDENT , RONALD REAGAN , AND I'D VETO THAT BILL IN A HEARTBEAT . IF THEY KEPT SENDING IT TO ME , I'D USE THE BULLY PULPIT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY FAMOUS . YOU'D KNOW WHO THEY ARE , AND YOU COULD HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE . NO IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT ANSWER TO WASTEFUL SPENDING . I HAVE THE VETO PEN OF RONALD REAGAN AND , I PROMISE YOU , I'LL USE IT . I HAVE A REPUTATION FOR STRAIGHT TALK AND WE NEED TO WORK TOGETHER TO INCREASE CAFE STANDARDS TO A LEVEL THAT IS PRACTICAL AND ACHIEVABLE FOR ALL NEW VEHICLES , FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC , BECAUSE IMPROVED FUEL ECONOMY WILL HELP OUR NATION ACHIEVE NATIONAL ENERGY SECURITY , REDUCE CARBON EMISSIONS , AND IMPROVE LOCAL AND REGIONAL AIR QUALITY . BUT AS WE STRIVE TO INCREASE FUEL ECONOMY , WE MUST ALSO ENSURE THAT WE MAINTAIN AUTO SAFETY . I BELIEVE THAT THE USE OF ADVANCED MATERIALS AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES INCLUDING ALTERNATIVELY-FUELED VEHICLES , FLEXIBLY-FUELED VEHICLES , AND PLUG-IN HYBRID VEHICLES CAN HELP US MEET OUR OBJECTIVES SUCCESSFULLY . AND AS THE WORLD'S NATIONS TAKE FURTHER ACTION TO REDUCE GLOBAL WARMING BY CUTTING THEIR CARBON FOOTPRINT , THE STEPS WE TAKE NOW WILL ALSO POSITION THE AMERICAN AUTO INDUSTRY AT THE FOREFRONT IN THE DEVELOPMENT AND PRODUCTION OF VEHICLES THE WORLD'S CONSUMERS WILL DEMAND FOR GENERATIONS . WE NEED TO BE AT THE CUTTING EDGE OF GREEN TECHNOLOGIES BECAUSE NINETY-FIVE PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S CUSTOMERS LIVE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES . WE NEED TO BE COMPETITIVE AS A MATTER OF SECURING THE FUTURE OF OUR CHILDREN . OUR FUTURE PROSPERITY DEPENDS ON OUR COMPETITIVENESS . BUT LET'S HAVE ONE MORE PIECE OF STRAIGHT TALK : GLOBALIZATION IS HERE , GLOBALIZATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY , BUT GLOBALIZATION WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BENEFIT EVERY AMERICAN . I KNOW THAT OPEN MARKETS DON'T AUTOMATICALLY TRANSLATE INTO A HIGHER QUALITY OF LIFE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN . CHANGE IS HARD , AND WHILE MOST OF US GAIN , SOME INDUSTRIES , COMPANIES AND WORKERS ARE FORCED TO STRUGGLE WITH VERY DIFFICULT CHOICES . IT WASN'T GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SPEND MILLIONS TO SAVE BUGGY WHIP FACTORIES AND HABERDASHERS WHEN CARS REPLACED CARRIAGES AND MEN STOPPED WEARING HATS . AND IT ISN'T GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO SPEND BILLIONS PRESERVING PRODUCTS AND SERVICES THAT WE CAN'T SELL ANYMORE . BUT IT IS GOVERNMENT'S JOB TO HELP WORKERS GET THE EDUCATION AND TRAINING THEY NEED FOR THE NEW JOBS THAT WILL BE CREATED BY NEW BUSINESSES IN THIS NEW CENTURY . RIGHT NOW WE HAVE A HALF-DOZEN DIFFERENT PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP DISPLACED WORKERS , AND ANOTHER HALF-DOZEN FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE NOT WORKING AT ALL . WE HAVE AN UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE PROGRAM STRAIGHT OUT OF THE 1950S . IT WAS DESIGNED TO ASSIST WORKERS THROUGH A FEW TOUGH MONTHS DURING AN ECONOMIC DOWNTURN UNTIL THEIR OLD JOBS CAME BACK . THAT PROGRAM HAS NO UNKNOWNWORD TO THE WORLD WE LIVE IN TODAY . IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK WITH CONGRESS AND THE STATES TO OVERHAUL UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AND MAKE IT A PROGRAM FOR RETRAINING , RELOCATING AND ASSISTING WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST A JOB THAT'S NOT COMING BACK TO FIND A JOB THAT WON'T GO AWAY . WE SHOULD REPLACE OUR OUTMODED AND REDUNDANT PROGRAMS WITH A SINGLE SYSTEM . WE CAN HELP PEOPLE GET BACK ON THEIR FEET MORE QUICKLY WITH JOBS IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR , WHICH OFFER THE BEST TRAINING FOR A CHANGING MARKETPLACE . WE CAN STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES AND TECHNICAL TRAINING , AND GIVE DISPLACED WORKERS MORE CHOICES TO FIND THEIR WAY BACK TO PRODUCTIVE AND PROSPEROUS LIVES . NO ONE SHOULD HAVE TO WAIT UNTIL THEY ARE LAID OFF TO BUILD A BETTER LIFE . WE CAN START RIGHT NOW BY IMPROVING THE ACCOUNTABILITY OF PUBLIC EDUCATION AT THE PRIMARY AND SECONDARY LEVEL , ALLOWING COMPETITION , AND HELPING PROVIDE PARENTS WITH CHOICES FOR THEIR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION . THE BETTER EDUCATED AMERICANS ARE , THE MORE CAPABLE THEY WILL BE OF ADJUSTING TO AND BENEFITING FROM ECONOMIC CHANGE . LET ME SUGGEST THREE IDEAS TO PROVIDE AMERICAN WORKERS THE CONTINUING OPPORTUNITIES THEY NEED TO ADAPT TO THE CHANGING ECONOMIC TIMES . FIRST , THE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM STILL SERVES WELL THE VAST MAJORITY OF WORKERS WHO QUICKLY CHANGE JOBS IN THIS FLUID ECONOMY . BUT IT NEEDS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD TO MEET THE GOALS OF HELPING DISPLACED WORKERS MAKE ENDS MEET BETWEEN JOBS AND MOVING PEOPLE QUICKLY ON TO THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY . SECOND , WE NEED TO BETTER CONNECT TRAINING WITH BUSINESS KNOWLEDGE AND NEEDS . WE NEED TO TRAIN PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS THAT EXIST TODAY AND THE NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE . THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT HAS A HALF-DOZEN TRAINING PROGRAMS - AND NO TRACK RECORD OF SUCCESS . AS I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AND EDUCATION EXPERTS I HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING THE RIGHT SKILLS TO WORKERS AND THE RIGHT WORKERS FOR FIRMS . WE SHOULD TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF THIS RECORD OF SUCCESS . AND WE CAN TRUST WORKERS TO CHOOSE . WE NEED TO TRANSFORM RIGID TRAINING PROGRAMS TO APPROACHES THAT CAN BE USED TO MEET THE BILLS , PAY FOR TRAINING , AND GET BACK TO WORK . THIRD , FOR OLDER WORKERS THE BEST TRAINING MAY BE GETTING BACK TO WORK . OLDER WORKERS CAN USE THEIR EXPERIENCE AND WORK ETHIC TO ADAPT TO THE CHALLENGES OF THE NEXT JOB . BUT OFTEN , THE STARTING PAY OF THE NEXT JOB DOESN'T MEASURE UP . WE CAN HELP THESE INDIVIDUALS HONOR THEIR TRADITION OF WORK AND ALLOW THEM TO KEEP UP WITH THE TIMES . FOR THOSE DISPLACED WORKERS WHO ARE 50 OR 55 AND MOVE TO A NEW JOB , LET'S GIVE THEM THE CHOICE OF EITHER TRAINING OR A FEW YEARS OF SUPPLEMENT TO THEIR EARNINGS SO THE FALL IS NOT SO FAR . THEY WILL BE LESS RESISTANT TO TAKING A LOWER PAYING JOB AND WE WILL ALL BENEFIT FROM HAVING THEIR EXPERIENCE BACK ON THE JOB . SO TODAY I ENCOURAGE MICHIGAN TO JOIN MY EFFORTS TO RESIST HIGHER TAXES , CONTROL SPIRALING HEALTH CARE COSTS , RESTORE TRUST IN GOVERNMENT , AND BUILD 21ST CENTURY LABOR MARKETS . IT WILL WORK FOR MICHIGAN . IT WILL WORK FOR AMERICA . WE HAVE MUCH TO BE HOPEFUL ABOUT . WE ARE POWERED BY ENTREPRENEURS THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND MAINTAIN AMERICA'S ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP . MY FRIENDS , AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL TO COME . DESPITE THE PESSIMISM PEDDLED BY POLITICIANS , YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . YOU CAN'T SCARE ME ABOUT THE FUTURE . YOU CAN'T CONVINCE ME THAT OUR PROBLEMS ARE INSURMOUNTABLE . I HAVE FACED ADVERSITY THROUGHOUT MY LIFE AND WITH PERSEVERANCE , HAVE OVERCOME IT . I WILL USE THOSE LESSONS NOW TO GUIDE MY RESOLVE AS PRESIDENT . WE STAND ON THE THRESHOLD OF ANOTHER CENTURY OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE ANOTHER CHAPTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS . THOSE OF US PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY NEED ONLY BE MINDFUL OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE US GREAT , HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND BY OUR PRINCIPLES , HONOR OUR PUBLIC TRUST , AND KEEP OUR PROMISES TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S INTERESTS BEFORE OUR OWN . I'VE ALWAYS KEPT MY PROMISES TO MY COUNTRY . I'LL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE NOW . AND I WILL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE AS PRESIDENT . THANK YOU .
RED	THANK YOU . IT'S A GREAT PLEASURE TO BE THE GUEST OF A GROUP THAT HAS MADE A PROFOUND CONTRIBUTION TO THE MICHIGAN ECONOMY . HISPANICS COMPRISE THE FASTEST GROWING ETHNIC GROUP IN THE MICHIGAN WORKFORCE . IN MICHIGAN , AS ELSEWHERE , HISPANICS ARE NOTABLE FOR THEIR COMMITMENT TO STARTING NEW BUSINESSES - ALMOST 7 PERCENT OF OUR BUSINESSES ARE HISPANIC-OWNED . ALMOST THREE-QUARTERS OF UNKNOWNWORD BUSINESS OWNERS STAKED THEIR PERSONAL SAVINGS ON THEIR SUCCESS , AND ONLY ONE-AND-HALF PERCENT TOOK THE SECURITY OF A GOVERNMENT LOAN , THE LOWEST PERCENTAGE OF ANY GROUP IN THE COUNTRY . THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS STRONGER FOR YOUR COURAGE , HARD WORK AND VISION . IN RETURN , POLITICIANS OWE OUR ENTREPRENEURS THE COURAGE AND WISDOM TO MAKE SURE THEIR DREAMS ARE GIVEN A FIGHTING CHANCE . TWO WORDS UNKNOWNWORD MY REMARKS ABOUT THE AMERICAN ECONOMY : FREEDOM WORKS . FREEDOM WORKS FOR EVERYONE , AND ONLY THROUGH FREEDOM HAS AMERICA ACHIEVED WHAT WAS ONCE THOUGHT IMPOSSIBLE - A SYSTEM IN WHICH ORDINARY PEOPLE WITH ORDINARY ABILITIES CAN CREATE FOR THEMSELVES EXTRAORDINARY LIVES . UNFORTUNATELY , WE FIND OURSELVES AT A TIME WHEN THE U.S . ECONOMY IS WEAKER THAN ANYONE WOULD LIKE . WHILE NATIONAL ECONOMIC GROWTH CONTINUES , INDICATORS OF THE FUTURE ARE MIXED . THE CURRENT WEAKNESS IS LARGELY THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM MARKET EXCESSES . HOUSING SPECULATORS FELT THAT PRICES WOULD ALWAYS RISE AND TOOK OUT RISKY MORTGAGES . INVESTORS THAT BOUGHT THOSE MORTGAGES SEEMINGLY BELIEVED THAT THE RATE OF RETURN WAS THE RESULT OF UNKNOWNWORD FINANCIAL ENGINEERING ; NOT THE ABILITY OF HOME-BUYERS TO MAKE THEIR PAYMENTS . SIMILAR ATTITUDES INFECTED THE CORPORATE MARKET , WHERE RAPID GAINS IN PROFITS COULD NOT GO ON FOREVER . IN THE END , HOUSE PRICES AND CORPORATE PROFITS CAME BACK TO EARTH , MARKETS GOT A REALITY CHECK , AND WE ARE WITNESSING THE PAINFUL PROCESS ECONOMISTS CALL "ADJUSTMENT ." AS YOU ARE WELL AWARE , CONDITIONS IN MICHIGAN ARE EVEN TOUGHER WITH THE STATE SUFFERING THROUGH ONE OF THE MOST SEVERE RECESSIONS SINCE WORLD WAR II . TOUGH TIMES CAN BREED FEAR , AND THE DEMOCRATS ARE USING THOSE FEARS TO PUSH AN AGENDA THAT IS TIRED AND DANGEROUS . ONCE AGAIN THEY WANT THE GOVERNMENT TO MAKE OUR CHOICES FOR US - NOT RESPECT OUR DREAMS , AND TRUST OUR DECISIONS ON HOW BEST TO SEIZE OUR OPPORTUNITIES . THEY ARE THREATENING TO GROW THE GOVERNMENT AND USE THE AMERICAN ECONOMY TO SERVE THEIR POLITICAL ENDS - NOT YOUR ASPIRATIONS . THEY WILL TAX , SPEND , REGULATE , AND DICTATE FOR THE BENEFIT OF SPECIAL INTERESTS AND PARTISAN OBJECTIVES , AND THEY ARE HELPING TO CAUSE A RISING TIDE OF ECONOMIC ISOLATIONISM THAT THREATENS OUR PROSPERITY AND THE STABILITY OF FRIENDLY NATIONS . THE PATTERN OF RECKLESS GOVERNMENT SPENDING HAS CAUSED AMERICANS TO LOSE TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT . I'VE BEEN AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO KNOW THAT THIS WILL FAIL . AND WHEN IT DOES , AMERICANS WILL HAVE YET ANOTHER REASON TO QUESTION THEIR GOVERNMENT . POLITICIANS NEED TO REMEMBER THAT AN EFFECTIVE GOVERNMENT IS A LIMITED GOVERNMENT . GOVERNMENT POLICY SHOULD ENHANCE , NOT DIMINISH , THE OPPORTUNITIES AVAILABLE TO AMERICAN WORKERS . PROTECTIONIST TRADE MEASURES TRIGGER ESCALATING PROTECTIONIST RESPONSES IN OTHER NATIONS THAT HARM AMERICAN WORKERS AND AMERICAN CONSUMERS . DEMOCRATS TELL US WE CAN BUILD A WALL AROUND AMERICA , BUT WE CAN'T HIDE . THE UNITED STATES CAN COMPETE AND WIN IN THE WORLD MARKETPLACE . CORPORATE WELFARE INCREASES THE SIZE OF GOVERNMENT AND UNKNOWNWORD RESOURCES FROM THE GROWING INDUSTRIES THAT HOLD THE KEY TO AMERICA'S CONTINUED ECONOMIC SUCCESS . EXCESSIVE AND INTRUSIVE REGULATION UNDERMINES THE FLEXIBILITY NEEDED FOR BUSINESS SUCCESS . THESE EXAMPLES UNKNOWNWORD WHY PART OF THE CONSERVATIVE TRADITION IN AMERICAN POLITICS HAS BEEN THE IDEA THAT SOMETIMES THE GOVERNMENT CAN BEST SERVE THE INTERESTS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BY KNOWING WHEN TO STAY OUT OF THEIR WAY . SINCE ADAM SMITH COINED THE PHRASE "THE INVISIBLE HAND ," ECONOMISTS , PHILOSOPHERS , AND OTHERS HAVE DEBATED VIRTUES OF MARKET ECONOMIES . YOU'LL EVEN HEAR SOME PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES CLAIMING TO UNDERSTAND THE FINER NUANCES OF MARKETS AND MANAGEMENT . IN FACT , SUCCESS HAS NOTHING TO DO WITH FANCY THEORY . THE SIMPLE LESSON OF HISTORY IS THAT THERE IS NO ECONOMIC FORCE ON THIS GLOBE THAT IS STRONGER THAN FREE PEOPLE . FREEDOM AND INITIATIVE WERE THE KEYS TO OUR PAST SUCCESSES AND THEY ARE THE KEYS TO OUR FUTURE ONES AS WELL . RONALD REAGAN ONCE SAID THAT "FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS . IT IS THE CONTINUOUS REVOLUTION OF THE MARKETPLACE . IT IS THE UNDERSTANDING THAT ALLOWS US TO RECOGNIZE SHORTCOMINGS AND SEEK SOLUTIONS ." HE SPOKE THESE WORDS TO UNIVERSITY STUDENTS IN MOSCOW IN 1988 . IT WAS A MESSAGE THEY NEEDED TO HEAR IN RUSSIA THEN , AND IT'S A MESSAGE THAT WE DESPERATELY NEED TO HEAR IN WASHINGTON NOW . ONE OF THE LAST VESTIGES OF REAL UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WORLD IS WASHINGTON , UNKNOWNWORD . ENTREPRENEURS LIE AT THE HEART OF INNOVATION , GROWTH , AND ADVANCING PROSPERITY . HARD WORK , INGENUITY , AND STARTING A BUSINESS ARE A PROVEN ROUTE TO MEETING ONE'S GOALS AND PROVIDING FOR CHILDREN AND FAMILY . A CULTURE THAT SUPPORTS ENTREPRENEURS AND UNKNOWNWORD THEIR SUCCESS WILL PROSPER . ENTREPRENEURS CREATE THE ULTIMATE JOB SECURITY - A NEW , BETTER OPPORTUNITY IF YOUR CURRENT JOB GOES AWAY . JOB SECURITY IS AN ELEMENT OF PARTICULAR CONCERN TO MICHIGAN WORKERS , PARTICULARLY THOSE IN THE AILING AUTOMOTIVE INDUSTRY . ECONOMIC INSECURITY IS SEEMINGLY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TODAY . ENTREPRENEURS ARE THE BEST ANTIDOTE FOR BOTH . BUT WE MUST PRESERVE THEIR FREEDOM . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE SHACKLED BY EXCESSIVE REGULATION THAT RAISES THE COST OF BUSINESS . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE DISADVANTAGED BY EARMARKING AND PORK-BARREL SPENDING THAT FAVORS POLITICALLY CONNECTED COMPETITORS . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE STARVED OF RISK CAPITAL BY BURDENSOME ACCOUNTING REQUIREMENTS THAT DRIVE CAPITAL TO OTHER MARKETS . ENTREPRENEURS SHOULD NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD INTO UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL TELL AMERICA'S ENTREPRENEURS THE SAME THING I'LL TELL ALL AMERICANS - THE TRUTH . YOU AND I BOTH KNOW THAT RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE A THREAT TO OUR GLOBAL COMPETITIVENESS , A THREAT TO OUR FAMILIES ' BUDGETS , A THREAT TO OUR GOVERNMENT'S SOLVENCY , AND A THREAT TO THE PROFITABILITY OF AMERICAN BUSINESS . AMERICA HAS THE BEST HEALTH CARE IN THE WORLD AND WE MUST WORK TO KEEP IT SO , BUT WE MUST ALSO WORK TO CONTROL COSTS AND MAKE THAT CARE MORE ACCESSIBLE . ONE WAY TO ACCOMPLISH THOSE GOALS IS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES LINK TOGETHER TO PROVIDE HEALTH CARE TO THEIR EMPLOYEES . BUT THAT IS JUST A START . WE HAVE TO GET SMART ON TAXES . OUR TAX CODE IS SO COMPLICATED IT EXTRACTS $140 BILLION IN EXTRA TAX PREPARATION COSTS EVERY YEAR - ONE THOUSAND DOLLARS FOR EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY . IT'S OFFENSIVE THAT SIX OUT OF EVERY TEN TAXPAYERS HAVE TO PAY SOMEONE ELSE JUST TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY THE GOVERNMENT . I WANT AMERICA'S SMARTEST PEOPLE CREATING JOBS , NOT WASTING THEIR TIME , ENERGY AND CAPITAL NAVIGATING OUR INCOMPREHENSIBLE TAX LAWS . NOW , HAVING ONE SYSTEM LIKE THIS IS BAD ENOUGH - BUT RIGHT NOW WE HAVE TWO OF THEM . WE CERTAINLY DON'T NEED TWO SEPARATE TAX SYSTEMS . THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX IS EXPECTED TO HIT UP TO 30 MILLION PEOPLE BY 2010 . I AM COMMITTED TO REPEALING THIS TAX BEFORE MILLIONS OF AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE FORCED TO DEVOTE EVEN MORE OF THEIR HARD WORK TO PAYING FOR THE SPENDING LARGESSE IN WASHINGTON . WE CAN HAVE A SINGLE , FAIR AND SIMPLER SYSTEM BUILT ON A FEW TAX RATES FOR CONSUMED INCOME AND STRAIGHTFORWARD CREDITS FOR WORK , HEALTH , EDUCATION , AND THOSE WITH A FAMILY . WE CAN MAKE OUR PERSONAL AND BUSINESS TAX SYSTEMS WORK COHESIVELY SO THAT WE CAN SHED OUR STATUS AS ONE OF THE LEAST ATTRACTIVE TAX JURISDICTIONS ON EARTH . LET NOBODY BE FOOLED : IF OUR LARGEST , BEST COMPANIES ARE OVERTAXED AND UNCOMPETITIVE , IT IS THE AMERICAN WORKER WHO SUFFERS . NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR DEMOCRATS TO BE THREATENING TO RAISE TAXES - THE ECONOMY IS WEAK AND THE COST OF CAPITAL HAS RISEN ALREADY . TODAY , THE GOVERNMENT SPENDS MORE MONEY THAN EVER BEFORE . SINCE RONALD REAGAN LEFT OFFICE , GOVERNMENT SPENDING ADJUSTED FOR INFLATION HAS INCREASED $2,500 FOR EVERY MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD IN THE COUNTRY . WASTEFUL SPENDING HAS GONE FROM IRRESPONSIBLE TO INDEFENSIBLE . AND WE'RE NOT SPENDING IT ON PROGRAMS THAT ARE ANY MORE EFFECTIVE THAN THEY WERE TWENTY YEARS AGO . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD STRIKES THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T EVEN READY TO DELIVER DRINKING WATER TO UNKNOWNWORD BABIES OR RESCUE THE AGED AND INFIRMED TRAPPED IN A HOSPITAL WITH NO ELECTRICITY . NO CAMPAIGN PROMISE , NO POLITICAL PHILOSOPHY , NO NATIONAL PRIORITY IS ALLOWED TO STAND IN THE WAY OF THE PREROGATIVES AND PRIORITIES OF THE APPROPRIATIONS COMMITTEES . WHEN AN APPROPRIATOR SAYS SPEND , WE SPEND . WE SPEND MONEY ON AN INDOOR RAINFOREST IN THE MIDWEST . WE SPEND IT TO STUDY THE DNA OF BEARS IN MONTANA , WITHOUT KNOWING WHETHER WE NEEDED TO SOLVE A CRIMINAL CASE OR A PATERNITY SUIT . WE EVEN TRIED TO SPEND IT TO BUILD A BRIDGE TO NOWHERE IN ALASKA . SUCH SPENDING MIGHT COME NATURAL TO DEMOCRATS , BUT REPUBLICANS PROMISED AN END TO SUCH EXTRAVAGANCES . BUT WE BROKE OUR PROMISE , AND DEMOCRATS EXPLOITED IT IN THE LAST ELECTION BY MAKING THEIR OWN PROMISES TO VOTERS THAT THEY WOULDN'T GO BACK TO THEIR OLD WAYS . I PROMISE , IF I'M ELECTED PRESIDENT I WON'T LET CONGRESS WASTE ANY MORE MONEY ON PROGRAMS THAT AREN'T REVIEWED OR THAT NEED TO BE REFORMED OR ABOLISHED OR ON PROJECTS THAT SERVE NO GREATER PURPOSE THAN TO DECEIVE VOTERS INTO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR LOCAL CONGRESSMAN . BUT THE SITUATION IS NOT HOPELESS , BECAUSE WE HAVE FREEDOM . FREEDOM IS THE RIGHT TO QUESTION AND CHANGE THE ESTABLISHED WAY OF DOING THINGS , AND MY FRIENDS , IF ELECTED PRESIDENT I'M GOING TO CHANGE THE WAY WE DEAL WITH SPENDING IN WASHINGTON . THE PRESIDENCY HAS MANY POWERS . ONE OF THE MOST USEFUL IS THE VETO PEN . I BELIEVE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD HAVE THE LINE ITEM VETO AS UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNORS HAVE , AND I'LL FIGHT TO GET IT . BUT I WON'T WAIT FOR IT . GIVE ME THE PEN , AND I'LL USE IT . I WON'T JUST TALK ABOUT IT , OR THREATEN IT , OR USE IT ONCE AND PUT IT BACK IN THE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD DUST . GIVE ME THE PEN , AND I'LL VETO EVERY SINGLE PORK BARREL BILL CONGRESS SENDS ME , AND IF THEY KEEP SENDING THEM TO ME , I'LL USE THE BULLY PULPIT TO MAKE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE WASTING YOUR MONEY FAMOUS . YOU'LL KNOW WHO THEY ARE , AND YOU CAN HOLD THEM ACCOUNTABLE . NO IS ALWAYS THE RIGHT ANSWER TO WASTEFUL SPENDING . GIVE ME THE PEN AND , I PROMISE YOU , I'LL SAY NO . AND I'LL SAY IT LOUD ENOUGH SO EVERYONE HEARS ME . ECONOMIC FREEDOM IS AT THE HEART OF OUR ABILITY TO TRANSFORM TOUGH TIMES TO BOOM TIMES . WE HAVE SUCCEEDED IN THE PAST , AND WE WILL DO SO AGAIN . THAT FREEDOM MUST INCLUDE ACCESS TO MARKETS ACROSS THE GLOBE . WE NEED TO BUILD ON OUR EXPORT STRENGTH NOT BY BUILDING WALLS TO INTERNATIONAL COMMERCE , NOT BY TAKING A HTIME OUT " FROM HISTORY , AND NOT BY PUTTING PARTISANSHIP AHEAD OF AMERICA'S PROSPERITY . TRADE ACCOUNTED FOR NEARLY ONE-HALF OF OUR ECONOMIC GROWTH DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THIS YEAR , AND HELPED TO OFFSET THE DRAG ON OUR ECONOMY FROM THE HOUSING SLUMP . TODAY , DESPITE ALL THE DEFEATIST RHETORIC , AMERICA IS THE WORLD'S BIGGEST EXPORTER , IMPORTER , PRODUCER , SAVER , INVESTOR , MANUFACTURER AND INNOVATOR . WHEN 95 PERCENT OF THE WORLD'S CUSTOMERS LIVE OUTSIDE THE UNITED STATES , WE NEED A GOVERNMENT THAT SECURES ACCESS TO THOSE CUSTOMERS FOR OUR ENTREPRENEURS , THEIR WORKERS , AND THE NEXT GENERATION . IT IS EASY TO ARGUE THAT AMERICAN WORKERS SHOULD TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THE FULL RANGE OF OPPORTUNITIES THAT ARE AVAILABLE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . BUT LET'S HAVE SOME STRAIGHT TALK : GLOBALIZATION IS HERE , GLOBALIZATION IS AN OPPORTUNITY , BUT GLOBALIZATION WILL NOT AUTOMATICALLY BENEFIT EVERY AMERICAN . MANY OF OUR CITIZENS HAVE PLAYED THE GAME THE WAY WE HAVE ASKED THEM TO -- WORKED HARD , GIVEN DECADES OF PRODUCTIVE LABOR TO THEIR EMPLOYERS , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR CHILDREN THROUGH SCHOOL , AND PAID THEIR TAXES . SUDDENLY , THE WORLD CHANGES , AND THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN THEY FIND THEMSELVES UNABLE TO COMPETE . SURELY THESE WORKERS ARE WORTHY OF OUR CONCERN AND ATTENTION , ESPECIALLY IN AN AGE WHEN DISPLACED CEOS CAN WALK AWAY WITH MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR GOLDEN GOODBYES . WE MUST REMAIN COMMITTED TO EDUCATION , RETRAINING , AND HELP FOR DISPLACED WORKERS , REGARDLESS OF WHETHER THEIR JOB WENT AWAY BECAUSE OF TRADE , TECHNOLOGICAL INNOVATION , OR UNKNOWNWORD IN CONSUMER SPENDING PATTERNS . FOR AMERICANS WHO HAVE LOST A JOB , WE NEED TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITIES FOR FURTHER EDUCATION AND TRAINING THAT CAN OPEN NEW DOORS . WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE SYSTEM TO REFLECT THE REALITY OF THE 21ST CENTURY ECONOMY : JOBS THAT GO AWAY NO LONGER COME BACK WHEN BUSINESS REBOUNDS . WE NEED TO HELP DISPLACED WORKERS MAKE ENDS MEET BETWEEN JOBS AND MOVE PEOPLE QUICKLY ON TO THE NEXT OPPORTUNITY . WE NEED TO REFORM THE HALF-DOZEN GOVERNMENT TRAINING PROGRAMS THAT ARE SUPPOSED TO HELP SUCH WORKERS . AS I TALK TO BUSINESS PEOPLE AND EDUCATION EXPERTS I HEAR AGAIN AND AGAIN THAT COMMUNITY COLLEGES DO A GREAT JOB OF PROVIDING THE RIGHT SKILLS TO WORKERS AND THE RIGHT WORKERS FOR FIRMS . WE SHOULD TAKE GREATER ADVANTAGE OF THIS RECORD OF SUCCESS , TRANSFORM RIGID TRAINING PROGRAMS , AND GET WORKERS BACK TO WORK . WE HAVE MUCH TO BE HOPEFUL ABOUT . WE ARE POWERED BY ENTREPRENEURS THAT WILL ENHANCE OUR GLOBAL ECONOMIC COMPETITIVENESS AND MAINTAIN AMERICA'S ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP . MY FRIENDS , AMERICA'S BEST DAYS ARE STILL TO COME . DESPITE THE PESSIMISM PEDDLED BY POLITICIANS , YOU CAN'T SELL ME ON HOPELESSNESS . WE STAND ON THE THRESHOLD OF ANOTHER CENTURY OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . WE HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO WRITE ANOTHER CHAPTER OF AMERICAN GREATNESS . THOSE OF US PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY NEED ONLY BE MINDFUL OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE US GREAT , HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND BY OUR PRINCIPLES , HONOR OUR PUBLIC TRUST , AND KEEP OUR PROMISES TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S INTERESTS BEFORE OUR OWN . I'VE ALWAYS KEPT MY PROMISES TO MY COUNTRY . I'LL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE NOW . AND I WILL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE AS PRESIDENT . THANK YOU .
RED	THANK YOU FOR THAT VERY GENEROUS INTRODUCTION . IT'S AN HONOR TO APPEAR AT THE HUDSON INSTITUTE . YOUR WORK IN PROMOTING GLOBAL SECURITY , PROSPERITY , AND FREEDOM IS WELL KNOWN . YOUR FOUNDER , HERMAN KAHN , VIRTUALLY INVENTED THE MODERN FIELD OF STRATEGIC STUDIES , AND TODAY HUDSON SCHOLARS CARRY ON HIS TRADITION OF HONEST , ORIGINAL AND FAR-SIGHTED THINKING ABOUT AMERICA'S SITUATION IN THE WORLD , AND THE CHALLENGES AND OPPORTUNITIES WE FIND AS WE CONTINUE THE WORK OF PRECEDING AMERICAN GENERATIONS TO MAKE THIS WORLD LESS THREATENING TO OUR SECURITY AND MORE HOSPITABLE TO OUR VALUES . IT HAS BEEN AN INTERESTING TWO WEEKS . GENERAL PETRAEUS AND AMBASSADOR CROCKER RETURNED FROM IRAQ AND GAVE CONGRESS AND THE COUNTRY AN HONEST ASSESSMENT OF PROGRESS IN IRAQ AND THE PROBLEMS WE STILL FACE AND A COGENT EXPLANATION OF HOW THE LONG OVERDUE CHANGE IN OUR TACTICS AND OBJECTIVES HAVE PRODUCED GREATER SUCCESS THERE THAN WE HAD ACHIEVED FOR THE FIRST FOUR YEARS OF THE WAR . BUT IN A CAMPAIGN SEASON THAT HAS , REGRETTABLY , SEEN TOO MANY OCCASIONS WHEN STATESMANSHIP HAS SURRENDERED TO PANDERING , LEADING DEMOCRATS AND PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES SPURN A CLEAR-EYED ASSESSMENT OF THE OPPORTUNITIES AND DIFFICULTIES AHEAD AND A STRATEGIC GRASP OF THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT FOR WHISTLING PAST THE GRAVE UNKNOWNWORD ALTERNATIVES , WHICH SELDOM RISE ABOVE THE LEVEL OF SOUNDBITES AND THAT LACK , EITHER BY DESIGN OR INEXPERIENCE , EVEN A CRUDE UNDERSTANDING OF THE REALITIES OF OUR SITUATION . UNKNOWNWORD , EFFORTS IN CONGRESS TO DENY GENERAL PETRAEUS AND AMERICAN FORCES IN IRAQ THE SUPPORT NECESSARY TO CONTINUE THEIR COUNTERINSURGENCY SUCCESSES HAVE LOST SUPPORT SINCE THE SUMMER . THAT IS , I BELIEVE , LARGELY ATTRIBUTABLE TO THE FACT THAT IT IS BECOMING CLEARER TO AMERICANS , AND TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FOR WHOM OUR SITUATION IN IRAQ IS A UNKNOWNWORD GREATER CONCERN THAN AN ELECTION THAT IS MORE THAN A YEAR AWAY , THAT AFTER FOUR YEARS OF UNKNOWNWORD FAILURE IN IRAQ , WE ARE BEGINNING TO GET THINGS RIGHT THERE . THAT IS A GREAT CREDIT TO GENERAL PETRAEUS , THE ARCHITECT AS WELL AS THE COMMANDER OF THE COUNTERINSURGENCY . IT IS AN EVEN GREATER CREDIT TO THE MEN AND WOMEN HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND , WHO HAVE BID GOOD-BYE AGAIN TO THEIR FAMILIES , WHILE NO DOUBT DIRECTING SOME WELL-DESERVED ABUSE AT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE PUT THEM IN THIS SITUATION , AND THEN SHOULDERED A RIFLE AND RISKED EVERYTHING - EVERYTHING - FOR OUR SAKE . ON THIS POINT I HOPE WE ALL AGREE , REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS . IT IS AN HONOR TO LIVE IN COUNTRY SO WELL DEFENDED BY SUCH BRAVE PATRIOTS . BUT DEMOCRATS WHO ASPIRE TO THE OFFICE OF COMMANDER IN CHIEF OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THEIR POSITIONS ON IRAQ AND THE LONG WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS ARE THE PRODUCT OF UNKNOWNWORD REASONING AND THEIR PROMISE OF MORE REALISTIC UNKNOWNWORD IS BASED ON , WELL , REALITY . INSTEAD , THEY ARGUE WE WILL MYSTERIOUSLY HAVE MORE LEVERAGE TO INDUCE DIFFICULT POLITICAL REFORMS IN IRAQ WHEN WE ANNOUNCE WE ARE LEAVING . THEY ARGUE THE WAR IS LOST JUST AS WE HAVE FINALLY BEGUN MAKING PROGRESS AND AL QAEDA'S UNKNOWNWORD HAVE TAKEN A DECIDED TO TURN FOR THE WORSE IN IRAQ . THEY ARGUE NOTHING HAS CHANGED IN IRAQ OVER THE LAST SIX MONTHS DESPITE THE UNKNOWNWORD EVIDENCE OF IMPROVEMENTS . THEY ARGUE WE CAN FIGHT AL QAEDA BETTER BY CEDING THE BATTLEFIELD TO THEM IN IRAQ . THEY REFUSE TO CONSIDER THE CONSEQUENCES OF DEFEAT : AN EMPOWERED IRAN , A VICTORIOUS AL QAEDA , A TERRORIST SAFE HAVEN , CIVIL WAR , GENOCIDE , AND A WIDER REGIONAL WAR . THEY ARE CIRCUMSPECT TO THE POINT OF POLITICAL COWARDICE TO THE FAR LEFT UNKNOWNWORD OF THEIR PARTY THAT SMEARS GENERAL PETRAEUS , A MAN FOR WHOM PERSONAL HONOR IS NO SMALL THING . THEY ARE SILENT ABOUT SYRIA'S EXPORT OF SUICIDE BOMBERS , AND IRAN'S EXPORTS OF TRAINING , WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT THAT IS BEING USED TO KILL AND MAIM AMERICAN SOLDIERS . THEY OFFER NOTHING OTHER THAN UNKNOWNWORD BASED ON A WITHDRAWAL THAT UNKNOWNWORD TO DEFEAT . IF WE CHOOSE TO LOSE IN IRAQ , ONE OF THE MANY DIRE CONSEQUENCES WILL BE A SURGE OF ANTHER TYPE : A SURGE OF AL QAEDA INTO AFGHANISTAN . THE LEVEL OF VIOLENCE WILL INCREASE , CASUALTIES WILL INCREASE , AND POLITICAL PROGRESS WILL SLOW . HOW LONG WILL IT THEN TAKE BEFORE THE SAME ADVOCATES OF SURRENDER IN IRAQ , BEGIN DEMANDING AN END TO OUR MISSION IN AFGHANISTAN , AND A "SURGE IN DIPLOMACY " AIMED AT A NEGOTIATED UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE TALIBAN ? IT IS NO LESS TRUE TODAY THAN IT HAS BEEN IN THE PAST : DEFEATISM WILL NOT BUY PEACE IN OUR TIME . IT WILL ONLY MAKE OUR FUTURE LESS SECURE AND OUR WORLD LESS SAFE . THIS WEEK AS WELL , COLUMBIA UNIVERSITY HOSTED IRANIAN PRESIDENT AHMADINEJAD , THE HOLOCAUST DENIER COMMITTED TO THE DESTRUCTION OF ISRAEL , WHOSE REGIME TARGETS AMERICAN SOLDIERS WITH IEDS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN . BUT WHILE COLUMBIA WELCOMED IRAN'S LEADER ON CAMPUS , ONE ORGANIZATION REMAINS UNWELCOME ON THE COLUMBIA CAMPUS : THE ROTC . IT IS UNCONSCIONABLE THAT COLUMBIA , HARVARD AND OTHER GREAT AMERICAN UNIVERSITIES REMAIN CLOSED TO ROTC , WHOSE GRADUATES REPRESENT THE BULK OF THE OFFICERS COMMISSIONED INTO OUR ARMED FORCES EACH YEAR . SOME ACADEMIC ELITES MAY NOT LIKE ROTC , AND THEY ARE FREE TO VOICE THEIR OBJECTIONS . BUT THEY ARE WRONG , AND I STAND WITH THE MANY GRADUATES OF THESE INSTITUTIONS WHO FOR YEARS HAVE BEEN TRYING IN VAIN TO BRING ROTC BACK TO THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . I FEAR FOR OUR FUTURE WHEN TERRORIST LEADERS ARE WELCOME AT OUR MOST PRESTIGIOUS CENTERS OF LEARNING , UNIVERSITIES UNKNOWNWORD TO STRENGTHEN AND UNKNOWNWORD THE IDEALS OF WESTERN LIBERAL POLITICAL THOUGHT , AND YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO VOLUNTEERED TO RISK THEIR LIVES TO DEFEND THOSE IDEALS ARE NOT . PREVAILING IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ARE CRITICAL TO DEFEATING THE THREAT POSED BY RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS , BUT ARE NOT THE LAST BATTLE IN THIS GLOBAL CHALLENGE . WE ARE IN A LONG WAR , A WAR I AM AFRAID THE US GOVERNMENT IS NOT ADEQUATELY PREPARED TO FIGHT . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NEED TESTED EXPERIENCE , POLITICAL COURAGE AND STRATEGIC CLARITY TO MAKE SOUND AND DIFFICULT DECISIONS , EVEN WHEN THOSE DECISIONS ARE NOT , AS FEW CRITICAL DECISIONS EVER ARE , IMMEDIATELY OR DECIDEDLY POPULAR . TOUGH TALK OR MANAGERIAL SUCCESSES IN THE PRIVATE SECTOR AREN'T ADEQUATE ASSURANCE THAT THEIR AUTHORS HAVE THE EXPERIENCE OR QUALITIES NECESSARY FOR SUCH A SINGULAR RESPONSIBILITY . WE HAVE TO MAKE FAR-REACHING REFORMS TO OUR GOVERNMENT TO PREPARE FOR THE LONG THREAT OUR ENEMIES PLAN FOR US , AND THE CRUEL AND UNKNOWNWORD MEANS THEY WILL EMPLOY TO HARM US . YOU DON'T JUST TALK ABOUT OR MANAGE SUCH CHANGES , YOU LEAD THEM . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE THREAT CONFRONTING AMERICA CHANGED RADICALLY BETWEEN THE FALL OF THE BERLIN WALL AND THE FALL OF THE TWIN TOWERS , AND YET OUR GOVERNMENTAL STRUCTURES HAVE NOT KEPT PACE . NO ONE WHO HAS VISITED OUR SERVICEMEN AND WOMEN IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN CAN DOUBT THEIR SKILLS , THEIR BRAVERY , OR THEIR DEDICATION . BUT IT IS EQUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO DOUBT THAT , AS I HAVE SAID FOR YEARS , THEY ARE OVERSTRETCHED AND UNDER-RESOURCED . I AM GLAD TO SEE THAT TROOP INCREASES ARE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD BUT CURRENT PLANS ARE NOT ENOUGH . AS PRESIDENT , I WOULD BRING THE ARMY AND MARINES FROM THE CURRENTLY PLANNED LEVEL OF ROUGHLY 750,000 TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS WILL COST REAL MONEY , SOME ADDITIONAL BILLIONS ANNUALLY , BUT IT WILL NOT REQUIRE A UNKNOWNWORD ANY MORE THAN SIMILAR LEVELS DID IN THE 1980S . IT IS VITALLY IMPORTANT FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT TO ISSUE A CALL TO SERVICE , TO SUMMON THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN OF AMERICA TO DEFEND THEIR COUNTRY AND ITS NOBLE IDEALS . I AM CONFIDENT THAT THIS GENERATION WILL ANSWER THE SUMMONS JUST AS SO MANY OF US DID IN PREVIOUS GENERATIONS . ALONG WITH MORE PERSONNEL , THE MILITARY WILL REQUIRE ADDITIONAL EQUIPMENT FOR THE EXPANDED FORCE , TO MODERNIZE FOR THE FUTURE , AND TO MAKE UP FOR LOSSES SUFFERED IN THE CURRENT WARS . WE CAN PARTIALLY OFFSET SOME OF THIS ADDITIONAL INVESTMENT BY CUTTING WASTEFUL FEDERAL SPENDING , INCLUDING UNNECESSARY PENTAGON PROGRAMS AND AN OFTEN DYSFUNCTIONAL PROCUREMENT SYSTEM . BUT WE CAN ALSO AFFORD TO SPEND MORE ON OUR DEFENSE . OUR DEFENSE BUDGET CURRENTLY CONSUMES LESS THAN 4 CENTS OF EVERY DOLLAR THAT OUR BOOMING ECONOMY GENERATES - FAR LESS THAN WE SPENT DURING THE COLD WAR . WHILE WE ENLARGE THE ARMED FORCES , WE MUST ALSO TRANSFORM THEM . TO A LARGE EXTENT , OUR MILITARY IS STILL CONFIGURED TO FIGHT ENEMIES THAT NO LONGER EXIST . OUR STEALTH BOMBERS , AIRCRAFT UNKNOWNWORD , AND NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD MAY MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN A FUTURE CONFLICT , BUT THEY DO LITTLE TO WIN OUR CURRENT STRUGGLES AGAINST TERRORISTS FROM THE HORN OF AFRICA TO THE HINDU KUSH . WHAT WE NEED TODAY ARE MORE SOLDIERS AND MORE CIVILIANS WITH THE RIGHT KIND OF SKILLS TO FIGHT A GLOBAL COUNTERINSURGENCY . THE BULK OF OUR EFFORT MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD HELPING FRIENDLY GOVERNMENTS AND THEIR SECURITY FORCES TO RESIST OUR COMMON FOES . TOWARD THAT END , I WOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT AN IDEA OFFERED BY LIEUTENANT UNKNOWNWORD JOHN UNKNOWNWORD , A VETERAN OF IRAQ AND ONE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGIC THINKERS . WE SHOULD CREATE AN ARMY ADVISOR CORPS WITH 20,000 SOLDIERS THAT WOULD WORK WITH FRIENDLY UNKNOWNWORD ABROAD . I WOULD INCREASE THE NUMBER OF PERSONNEL IN INFORMATION OPERATIONS , SPECIAL FORCES , CIVIL AFFAIRS , MILITARY POLICING , MILITARY INTELLIGENCE , AND OTHER DISCIPLINES . WE MUST STRIVE TO ENHANCE OUR UNDERSTANDING OF FOREIGN CULTURES - THE HUMAN TERRAIN ON WHICH WE FIGHT . WE NEED TO LAUNCH A CRASH PROGRAM IN BOTH CIVILIAN AND MILITARY SCHOOLS TO INCREASE THE NUMBER OF EXPERTS IN STRATEGIC LANGUAGES SUCH AS UNKNOWNWORD AND PASHTO . WE NEED TO REQUIRE STUDENTS AT OUR SERVICE ACADEMIES TO SPEND TIME STUDYING ABROAD . AND WE NEED TO ENHANCE THE FOREIGN AREA CAREER FIELD WITHIN THE MILITARY WHILE CREATING A NEW FIELD IN STRATEGIC INTERROGATION . IN THIS WAY WE COULD PRODUCE MORE INTERROGATORS WHO CAN ATTAIN CRITICAL KNOWLEDGE FROM DETAINEES USING ADVANCED PSYCHOLOGICAL TECHNIQUES AND NOT THE KIND OF UNKNOWNWORD TACTICS THAT ARE RIGHTLY PROHIBITED BY THE GENEVA UNKNOWNWORD . EVEN AS WE INCREASE OUR MILITARY CAPACITY , WE MUST ALSO INCREASE OUR CIVILIAN CAPACITY SO THAT AN UNDUE BURDEN DOES NOT AGAIN FALL ON OUR SOLDIERS AS IT HAS IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ , WHERE THE CIVILIAN AGENCIES OF OUR GOVERNMENT HAVE TOO OFTEN BEEN MISSING IN ACTION . THE STATE DEPARTMENT AND OTHER AGENCIES NEED TO ENHANCE THEIR ABILITY TO SEND MORE EXPERTS TO REBUILD WAR-TORN LANDS - OR , BETTER STILL , BOLSTER PEACEFUL DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE THE CHANCES OF WAR BREAKING OUT IN THE FIRST PLACE . TO BETTER COORDINATE OUR UNKNOWNWORD EFFORTS , I WOULD ASK CONGRESS FOR A CIVILIAN FOLLOW-ON TO THE 1986 GOLDWATER-NICHOLS ACT WHICH UNKNOWNWORD A CULTURE OF JOINT OPERATIONS WITHIN THE SEPARATE MILITARY SERVICES . TODAY WE NEED SIMILAR LEGISLATION TO ENSURE THAT CIVIL SERVANTS AND SOLDIERS TRAIN AND WORK TOGETHER IN UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THEY CAN COOPERATE EFFECTIVELY IN UNKNOWNWORD AND IN UNKNOWNWORD RECONSTRUCTION . AS PRESIDENT , I WOULD REVITALIZE OUR PUBLIC DIPLOMACY . IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION AND WE IN CONGRESS AGREED TO ABOLISH THE UNITED STATES INFORMATION AGENCY AND PUT ITS PUBLIC DIPLOMACY FUNCTIONS INSIDE THE STATE DEPARTMENT . THIS WAS A MISTAKE . DISMANTLING AN AGENCY DEDICATED TO PROMOTING AMERICA'S MESSAGE AMOUNTED TO UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT IN THE STRUGGLE OF IDEAS . COMMUNICATING OUR GOVERNMENT'S VIEWS ON UNKNOWNWORD ISSUES IS WHAT THE STATE DEPARTMENT DOES . BUT COMMUNICATING THE IDEA OF AMERICA , OUR PURPOSE , OUR PAST AND OUR FUTURE IS A DIFFERENT TASK . WE NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD AN INDEPENDENT AGENCY WITH THE SOLE PURPOSE OF GETTING AMERICA'S MESSAGE TO THE WORLD - A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN COMBATING ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . THE COLD WAR WAS WON NOT WITH A TANK BATTLE IN THE FULDA GAP , BUT BY WINNING THE HEARTS AND MINDS OF THE PEOPLE THAT DEMOCRACY WAS BETTER THAN COMMUNISM . AND SO IT MUST BE IN OUR STRUGGLE WITH ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . WE MUST WIN THIS WAR BY CONVINCING THE WORLD THAT FREEDOM IS BETTER THAN RULE BY TERROR . WE ALSO NEED TO DEVELOP A DEPLOYABLE POLICE PRESENCE TO , WHEN NECESSARY , HELP MAINTAIN LAW AND ORDER WHERE IT IS LACKING , AND TO TRAIN FOREIGN POLICE FORCES TO COUNTER ISLAMIC EXTREMISM AND OTHER THREATS . IN THE END , DOLLARS , EXPERTS , AND POLICE MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ADDRESS THE INTERRELATED ISSUES OF POLITICAL FREEDOM , GOOD GOVERNANCE , AND ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . I WOULD ALSO SET UP A NEW CIVIL-MILITARY AGENCY PATTERNED AFTER THE OFFICE OF STRATEGIC SERVICES IN WORLD WAR II . A MODERN-DAY OSS COULD DRAW TOGETHER UNCONVENTIONAL WARFARE , UNKNOWNWORD , PARAMILITARY AND PSYCHOLOGICAL-WARFARE SPECIALISTS FROM THE MILITARY TOGETHER WITH COVERT-ACTION OPERATORS FROM OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES AND EXPERTS IN ANTHROPOLOGY , ADVERTISING , FOREIGN CULTURES , AND NUMEROUS OTHER DISCIPLINES FROM INSIDE AND OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT . IN THE SPIRIT OF THE ORIGINAL OSS , THIS WOULD BE A SMALL , NIMBLE , CAN-DO ORGANIZATION THAT WOULD FIGHT TERRORIST SUBVERSION ACROSS THE WORLD AND IN UNKNOWNWORD . IT COULD TAKE RISKS THAT OUR BUREAUCRACIES TODAY ARE AFRAID TO TAKE - RISKS SUCH AS UNKNOWNWORD AGENTS WHO LACK DIPLOMATIC COVER INTO TERRORIST ORGANIZATIONS . IT COULD EVEN LEAD IN THE FRONT-LINE EFFORTS TO REBUILD FAILED STATES . A CADRE OF SUCH UNKNOWNWORD OPERATIVES WOULD ALLOW US TO GAIN THE INTELLIGENCE ON TERRORIST ACTIVITIES THAT WE DON'T GET TODAY FROM OUR HIGH-TECH SURVEILLANCE SYSTEMS AND FROM A CIA CLANDESTINE SERVICE THAT WORKS ALMOST ENTIRELY OUT OF OUR EMBASSIES ABROAD . THESE ARE NOT MEASURES THAT WILL PAY QUICK DIVIDENDS . WE MUST UNDERSTAND THAT WE CONFRONT A LENGTHY STRUGGLE - A LONG WAR - THAT WILL NOT BE WON QUICKLY OR EASILY . BUT WE WILL WIN IT . WHILE OUR ULTIMATE VICTORY IS NOT IN DOUBT , THE LENGTH AND INTENSITY OF THIS STRUGGLE REMAIN TO BE DETERMINED . IT'S UP TO US . WE HAVE HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT CHOICES TO MAKE , ALL OF US , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , THEIR PRESIDENT , AND THEIR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS . WE MUST RECOGNIZE THAT OUR ENEMIES ARE IN THIS FIGHT TO WIN , AND SO MUST WE BE . WE MUST USE OUR STRENGTHS , OUR RESOURCES , OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND OUR FORTITUDE - QUALITIES THAT HAVE DISTINGUISHED US THROUGH HISTORY AND WHICH HAVE NEVER FAILED US - TO DEFEAT OUR UNPARDONABLE FOE . WE MUST ACT BOLDLY AND WITH CONFIDENCE THAT HISTORY HAS NOT YET ASSIGNED US A CHALLENGE THAT WE CANNOT MEET SUCCESSFULLY . THOUGH WE REGRET THE MISTAKES WE HAVE MADE IN THIS WAR , THEY MUST NOT CAUSE US SELF DOUBT . WE MUST LEARN FROM THEM , AS AMERICANS HAVE ALWAYS LEARNED FROM OUR MISTAKES , AND FIGHT SMARTER AND HARDER . THOUGH WE MOURN THE LOSSES WE HAVE ALREADY INCURRED IN THIS WAR , WE MUST NOT LET OUR GRIEF WEARY US SO THAT WE CANNOT DO THE WORK THAT IS OURS TO DO . THESE ARE THE DECISIONS CONFRONTING AMERICAN VOTERS IN THIS ELECTION , AND THEY WILL CONFRONT THE PERSON YOU ELECT PRESIDENT . IN NOVEMBER , 2008 THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WILL DECIDE WITH THEIR VOTES HOW AND WHERE THIS WAR WILL BE FOUGHT OR IF IT WILL BE FOUGHT AT ALL . I HAVE TOLD YOU HOW I INTEND TO FIGHT THIS WAR . OTHER CANDIDATES WILL ARGUE FOR A DIFFERENT COURSE . DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT WILL ARGUE FOR THE COURSE OF CUTTING OUR LOSSES AND WITHDRAWING FROM THE THREAT IN THE VAIN HOPE IT WILL NOT FOLLOW US HERE . I CANNOT JOIN THEM IN SUCH WISHFUL AND VERY DANGEROUS THINKING . PEACE AT ANY PRICE IS AN ILLUSION AND ITS COSTS ARE ALWAYS MORE TRAGIC THAN THE SACRIFICES VICTORY REQUIRES . I WILL STAND WHERE I STAND TODAY AND TRUST YOU TO GIVE ME A FAIR HEARING . THERE IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION FOR ANY CANDIDATE TO DO LESS . THANK YOU .
RED	 THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK TO THIS 27TH UNKNOWNWORD REPUBLICAN LEADERSHIP CONFERENCE . I STAND BEFORE YOU AT A PERILOUS TIME , A PERILOUS TIME FOR OUR PARTY BUT , FAR MORE IMPORTANT , A PERILOUS TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY . WE FACE AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY DEDICATED TO OUR DESTRUCTION . WE FACE CRITICISM AT HOME AND ABROAD . SOME DOUBT THAT WE CAN PREVAIL AGAINST OUR ENEMIES -- ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THAT OPERATE IN EUROPE , THE AMERICAS , AFRICA , THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA . JUST THIS MONTH , TERRORIST PLOTS WERE UNCOVERED IN DENMARK AND GERMANY THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS DEMONSTRATING HOW SERIOUS THE THREAT IS , YET MUCH OF WASHINGTON REMAINS MIRED IN IRRESOLUTION AND DEFEATISM . YOUR CONFERENCE THEME OF "RELYING ON OUR ROOTS " IS APPROPRIATE FOR MY MESSAGE TODAY . MICHIGAN HAS A FINE TRADITION OF LEADERSHIP IN THE REPUBLICAN PARTY , INCLUDING THE LATE PRESIDENT FORD . BUT I WOULD LIKE TO SPEAK TO YOU ABOUT ANOTHER EXEMPLARY LEADER OF OUR PARTY WHOSE ROOTS OF LEADERSHIP AND WISDOM WE SHOULD ALSO REMEMBER AND RELY ON . THREE DECADES AGO , A VISIONARY POLITICIAN DESCRIBED THE DANGERS IN THE WORLD . IT WAS , LIKE TODAY , A TIME WHEN SOME DOUBTED AMERICA'S GOODNESS AND GREATNESS . MANY ARGUED FOR RECONCILIATION WITH OUR GLOBAL ADVERSARY . BUT THIS MAN HELD FIRM . HE DID NOT CARE WHAT EDITORIAL BOARDS WROTE ABOUT HIM . HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT . HE CRITICIZED THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ' FOREIGN POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION . HE CALLED FOR RESOLVE AND FIRMNESS IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION . AND , HE REFUSED TO CONDEMN MILLIONS TO PERPETUAL COMMUNIST TYRANNY IN THE FALSE HOPE THAT ACCOMMODATING THE SOVIET UNION WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S SECURITY . FORTUNATELY , THIS MAN , GOVERNOR REAGAN , BECAME PRESIDENT REAGAN . HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE HAD HE NOT WON ELECTION IN 1980 AND 1984 ? DOES ANYONE BELIEVE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CALLED THE SOVIET UNION AN "EVIL EMPIRE " OR WOULD HAVE STOOD UP TO THE NUCLEAR FREEZE MOVEMENT ? CAN YOU IMAGINE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT SAYING COMMUNISM SHOULD BE LEFT ON THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY , OR CALLING ON GORBACHEV TO TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL ? WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS TRIED TO DEFUND WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND FREEDOM FIGHTERS , RONALD REAGAN WAS STEADFAST -- AND HE WAS RIGHT . THANKS TO HIS LEADERSHIP , THE SOVIET UNION DISSOLVED AND THE COLD WAR WAS WON ON OUR TERMS . TODAY , THE CHALLENGES ARE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THEY WERE WHEN RONALD REAGAN STOOD TALL . AND , TODAY , THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ARE EVERY BIT AS STARK AS THEY WERE 30 YEARS AGO . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE AGAINST FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS ENGAGED IN WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A WAR ON TERROR , OFFER TO ENTER INTO UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR WORST ENEMIES , AND TALK ABOUT COUNTERING THE FORCES OF RADICALISM BY ADVOCATING SURRENDER TO THEM IN IRAQ . IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY IN IRAQ , IF WE CEDE IRAQ TO AL QAEDA , HOW LONG WILL THEY STAY THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN ? WE FACE GRAVE CHALLENGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST : HALTING IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS ; PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY , ISRAEL ; SUPPORTING MODERATE VOICES AGAINST THE KILLERS OF HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; DEFENDING LEBANON'S SOVEREIGNTY AGAINST SYRIAN AND IRANIAN AGGRESSION . DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT IN IRAQ ? IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO THINK SO , AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO DOES ISN'T PREPARED TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . THE WORLD RONALD REGAN FACED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT IRRATIONAL . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M NOSTALGIC FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD MAN'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHEN HE MISSPENT HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH CRUELTY AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS MY FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE GLIMPSE THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT , AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT , THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE DESTABILIZING THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO DESPISES US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . AS WE MEET HERE TODAY , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GROWN SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . LIKE YOU , I WANT OUR TROOPS TO COME HOME , BUT I WANT THEM TO COME HOME WITH HONOR . THE HONOR OF VICTORY THAT IS DUE ALL OF THOSE WHO HAVE PAID WITH THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE SO THAT SACRIFICE IS NOT IN VAIN . WE HAVE NEW COMMANDERS IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY THAT I HAVE CALLED FOR FROM THE BEGINNING , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS FAILED . ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNCERTAIN , WE MUST GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND ADEQUATE TIME TO SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST MISTAKES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT -- AS MANY LEADING DEMOCRATS NOW ADVOCATE -- WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , EMPOWER IRAN AND OTHER HOSTILE POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY PROVOKE GENOCIDE THERE , AND DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION AS NEIGHBORING POWERS COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAVORED FACTIONS . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY DRAW US INTO A WIDER AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD IMPOSE EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . LET ME BE CLEAR : CHOOSING TO LOSE IN IRAQ WOULD HAND A VICTORY TO THE RADICALS IN CONTROL OF IRAN . AS IRAN'S PRESIDENT RECENTLY UNKNOWNWORD , "SOON , WE WILL SEE A HUGE POWER VACUUM IN THE REGION [AND ] WE ARE PREPARED TO FILL THE GAP UNKNOWNWORD IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAR AGAINST OUR FORCES IN IRAQ FOR YEARS . THEY ARE ACTIVELY UNKNOWNWORD SUNNI AND SHIA RADICALS WITH ADVANCED WEAPONS AND ON THE GROUND TRAINING . TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO , THE RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAN RELEASED AMERICAN HOSTAGES HELD ILLEGALLY FOR MORE THAN 400 DAYS RATHER THAN FACE PRESIDENT REAGAN . IT WAS THE FIRST VICTORY OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WE SHOULD HEED THE LESSON IT HOLDS FOR DEALING WITH IRAN TODAY : DETERMINATION AND RESOLVE , NOT ACCOMMODATION AND APPEASEMENT , ARE WHAT UNKNOWNWORD HEEDS . AND I CERTAINLY THINK A MAN WHO IS DIRECTING THE MAIMING AND KILLING OF AMERICANS TROOPS SHOULD NOT BE GIVEN AN INVITATION TO SPEAK AT AN AMERICAN UNIVERSITY . RATHER THAN ROLLING OUT THE RED CARPET FOR THE LEADER OF A TERRORIST-SPONSORING REGIME , COLUMBIA SHOULD BE WELCOMING THE RESERVE OFFICERS ' TRAINING CORPS BACK ON CAMPUS TO HONOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO PUT THEIR LIVES ON THE LINE EVERY DAY DEFENDING OUR FREEDOM . RONALD REAGAN WARNED OF THE NEED FOR FIRMNESS AND VIGILANCE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNFORTUNATELY , WE DID NOT HEED HIS WISDOM AND WE PAID A HORRIBLE PRICE FOR WEAKNESS AND INATTENTION TOWARD THE THREAT POSED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISM IN THE 1990S . BUT TODAY , OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE EVEN MORE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT . I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE PERSEVERE WE CAN SUCCEED ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF IRAQ AND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT IS TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I POSSESS , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A PROSPECT FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT BEFALL US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL CHOSEN . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL -- THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT -- HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION OF THE BEST AMERICANS , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND COSTLY CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE FOR US AND FOR THE WORLD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , RONALD REAGAN GAVE HIS FAMOUS "SHINING CITY UPON A HILL " SPEECH AND CONCLUDED BY SAYING : "WE CANNOT ESCAPE OUR DESTINY , NOR SHOULD WE TRY TO DO SO . THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FREE WORLD WAS THRUST UPON US IN THE LITTLE HALL OF PHILADELPHIA . IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II , WHEN THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND POWER OF AMERICA WAS ALL THE STOOD BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE RETURN TO THE DARK AGES , POPE UNKNOWNWORD XII SAID , 'THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT GENIUS FOR SPLENDID AND UNSELFISH ACTIONS . INTO THE HANDS OF AMERICA , GOD HAS PLACED THE DESTINIES OF AN AFFLICTED MANKIND .' WE ARE INDEED , AND WE ARE TODAY , THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH ." IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO HEAR GOVERNOR REAGAN DELIVER THAT SPEECH . I HAD RECENTLY BEEN RELEASED FROM A LONG INVOLUNTARY UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS UNKNOWNWORD AS GOVERNOR REAGAN'S GUEST . HIS WORDS RING TRUE TODAY WHEN , ONCE AGAIN , IT FALLS TO AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST A GLOBAL THREAT , TO REMAIN THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE BRAVER OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU .
RED	IT IS A PLEASURE TO APPEAR BEFORE YOU THIS MORNING . I SEE A LOT OF OLD FRIENDS HERE , FRIENDS LIKE JIM BAKER WHOM I WORKED WITH AS LONG AGO AS THE 1980S IN THE STRUGGLE TO PRESERVE FIREARMS FREEDOM . HIS HAIR WAS NOT SO UNKNOWNWORD BACK THEN -- AND I HAD A LOT MORE OF IT . THIS IS A UNKNOWNWORD CROWD . YOU KNOW POLITICS , AND YOU KNOW POLITICIANS . YOU ARE PRETTY USED TO HEARING ASPIRANTS FOR PUBLIC OFFICE COME BEFORE YOU AND PLEDGE FEALTY TO THE CAUSE OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT . YOU KNOW YOU NEED TO DIG INTO A POLITICIAN'S RECORD TO FIND OUT WHERE THEY REALLY STAND . YOU KNOW SOME WILL CHANGE THEIR POSITION OR HAVE LITTLE RECORD FOR YOU TO JUDGE . THAT IS NOT THE CASE WITH ME . WHEN I FIRST RAN FOR CONGRESS IN 1982 , I WAS PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF GUN OWNERS AND THE NATIONAL RIFLE ASSOCIATION . FOR MORE THAN TWO DECADES , I'VE OPPOSED THE EFFORTS OF THE ANTI-GUN CROWD TO BAN GUNS , BAN AMMUNITION , BAN UNKNOWNWORD , AND PAINT GUN OWNERS AS SOME KIND OF FRINGE GROUP , DANGEROUS IN UNKNOWNWORD " AMERICA . SOME EVEN CALL YOU "EXTREMISTS ." MY FRIENDS , GUN OWNERS ARE NOT EXTREMISTS , YOU ARE THE CORE OF MODERN AMERICA . THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS UNIQUE IN THE WORLD AND AT THE CORE OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL FREEDOMS . IT GUARANTEES AN INDIVIDUAL RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS . TO ARGUE ANYTHING ELSE IS TO REJECT THE CLEAR MEANING OF OUR FOUNDING FATHERS . BUT THE CLEAR MEANING OF THE SECOND AMENDMENT HAS NOT STOPPED THOSE WHO WANT TO PUNISH FIREARMS OWNERS -- AND THOSE WHO MAKE AND SELL FIREARMS -- FOR THE ACTIONS OF CRIMINALS . IT SEEMS LIKE EVERY TIME THERE IS A PARTICULARLY VIOLENT CRIME , THE ANTI-GUN CROWD COMES UP WITH A PLAN TO CAPITALIZE ON TRAGEDY AND LIMIT SECOND AMENDMENT RIGHTS FOR ALL AMERICANS . I OPPOSED THE BAN ON SO-CALLED "ASSAULT WEAPONS " WHICH WAS FIRST PROPOSED AFTER A CALIFORNIA SCHOOLYARD SHOOTING . I THOUGHT IT MADE NO SENSE TO BAN A CLASS OF FIREARMS BASED ON COSMETIC FEATURES . I OPPOSED WAITING UNKNOWNWORD FOR GUN PURCHASES . WE LOST ON BOTH OF THOSE IN THE SHORT RUN , BUT IT HAS WORKED OUT BETTER IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . FORTUNATELY , THAT GUN BAN UNKNOWNWORD AFTER 10 LONG YEARS . AND , I WAS PROUD TO VOTE AGAINST THOSE WHO TRIED TO EXTEND IT IN 2004 . I ALSO OPPOSED EFFORTS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR FIREARMS MANUFACTURERS BY MAKING THEM LIABLE FOR THE ACTS OF VIOLENT CRIMINALS . THIS WAS A PARTICULARLY DEVIOUS EFFORT TO USE LAWSUITS TO BANKRUPT OUR GREAT GUN MANUFACTURERS . A NUMBER OF BIG-CITY MAYORS DECIDED IT WAS MORE IMPORTANT TO BLAME THE MANUFACTURERS OF A LEGAL PRODUCT THAN IT WAS TO CONTROL CRIME IN THEIR OWN CITIES . FORTUNATELY , WE ARE ABLE TO PROTECT MANUFACTURERS FROM THESE FRIVOLOUS LAWSUITS . IN MY YEARS IN WASHINGTON , I HAVE SEEN WHAT I WILL CALL THREE MYTHS USED BY POLITICIANS TO EXCUSE THEIR SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL . FIRST , IS THE BIG CITY MYTH : THAT IT IS ACCEPTABLE -- EVEN NECESSARY -- TO FIGHT CRIME IN BIG CITIES . IF YOU HAVE A CRIME PROBLEM , THEY SAY IT'S REALLY A GUN PROBLEM . SO INSTEAD OF INCREASING POLICE PATROLS , INSTITUTING TOUGH SENTENCES FOR LAWBREAKERS AND OTHER MEASURES THAT WOULD ACTUALLY ADDRESS CRIME , WE RESTRICT OWNERSHIP OF GUNS AND LIMIT THE RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING CITIZENS . WE ARE MEETING TODAY IN A CITY THAT REPRESENTS THE WORST OF THIS MYTH . THE CITIZENS OF THE NATION'S CAPITAL DO NOT ENJOY THE RIGHT TO KEEP AND BEAR ARMS . THAT IS WHY I HAVE CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION REPEALING THE BAN ON FIREARMS POSSESSION FOR LAW ABIDING CITIZENS IN THE DISTRICT OF COLOMBIA . THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT JUST FOR RURAL ARIZONA , IT IS FOR ALL OF AMERICA . THE SECOND MYTH IS THAT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD GUN ." THIS WAS AT THE CORE OF THE DEBATE OVER SO-CALLED "ASSAULT WEAPONS ." PROPONENTS OF THIS MYTH ARGUE THAT SOME KINDS OF GUNS ARE ACCEPTABLE -- FOR NOW -- BUT OTHERS ARE NOT IF THEY HAVE CERTAIN FEATURES -- LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD GRIP OR AN EXTENDED MAGAZINE . I WILL CONTINUE TO OPPOSE THOSE WHO WANT TO RATION THE SECOND AMENDMENT BASED ON THEIR VIEWS OF WHAT GUNS IT APPLIES TO . FINALLY , THERE IS THE HUNTING MYTH -- IF YOU SHOW YOUR UNKNOWNWORD FIDES BY HUNTING DUCKS OR VARMINTS OR QUAIL , IT MAKES UP FOR SUPPORT FOR GUN CONTROL . THIS MYTH UNKNOWNWORD A FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH : THE SECOND AMENDMENT IS NOT ABOUT HUNTING , IT IS ABOUT FREEDOM . OVER THE YEARS , WE HAVE NOT AGREED ON EVERY ISSUE . WE HAD DIFFERENCES OVER MY EFFORTS TO STANDARDIZE THE SALES PROCEDURES AT GUN SHOWS AND TO CLEAN UP OUR CAMPAIGN FINANCE SYSTEM . I UNDERSTAND AND RESPECT YOUR POSITION . BUT WHILE WE MAY DISAGREE ON THE MEANS WE DO AGREE ON THE NEED TO KEEP GUNS OUT OF THE HANDS OF CRIMINALS AND , IN LIGHT OF THE NUMBER OF MY COLLEAGUES WHO HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD , ARE UNDER INVESTIGATION AND ARE WORRIED ABOUT INDICTMENT , AGREE THAT WASHINGTON NEEDS CLEANING UP . AMERICANS HAVE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT AND THAT TRUST MUST BE RESTORED . BUT THESE MINOR DIFFERENCES UNKNOWNWORD IN COMPARISON TO OUR SHARED VISION OF A SECOND AMENDMENT PROTECTED FROM POLITICAL VAGARIES . AND WE HAVE REAL DIFFERENCES WITH MANY OF THOSE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT . DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES HAVE LEARNED SOMETHING SINCE 2000 . THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT THEIR PLANS FOR GUN CONTROL . THEY POSE FOR THE CAMERAS IN CAMOUFLAGE . BUT THAT IS ALL THEY ARE DOING -- POSING . JUST BECAUSE THEY DON'T TALK ABOUT GUN CONTROL DOESN'T MEAN THEY DON'T WANT GUN CONTROL . LET'S BE CLEAR . IF HILLARY CLINTON , BARACK OBAMA OR JOHN EDWARDS ARE ELECTED PRESIDENT , THEY WILL GO AFTER THE RIGHTS OF LAW ABIDING GUN OWNERS -- JUST AS BILL CLINTON DID WHEN HE WAS PRESIDENT . UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH SEEMS TO BE CALLING THE SHOTS IN THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY THESE DAYS , WILL HAVE MORE INFLUENCE ON GUN CONTROL IN THE OVAL OFFICE , NOT JOHN UNKNOWNWORD . THESE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES VOTED TO BAN GUNS OR BAN AMMUNITION OR TO ALLOW GUN MAKERS TO BE SUED OUT OF EXISTEN CE AS SENATORS . THINK HOW MUCH WORSE IT WOULD BE IF THEY HAD THE POWER TO APPOINT SUPREME COURT JUSTICES , NAME ATTORNEYS GENERAL AND USE THE FULL POWER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . AND JUST AS THE DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES ARE FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE SECOND AMENDMENT , THEY ARE FUNDAMENTALLY WRONG ABOUT THE KEY THREATS FACING AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY . AS WE MEET , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GROWN SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL -- AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING -- SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . IN THE COMING MONTH WE WILL FACE A FORK IN THE ROAD . WE CAN PURSUE OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR VICTORY IN IRAQ , STRENGTHEN OUR HAND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD EXTREMISTS , AND MAKE OUR NATION MORE SECURE . OR WE CAN FOLD OUR TENTS , EMBOLDEN OUR ENEMIES , THROW A REGION INTO UNKNOWNWORD , AND INCREASE THE RISKS FACED ON OUR HOME SOIL . WHICH WAY REQUIRES GREATER LEADERSHIP ? I AM LEADING THE FIGHT ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS AND IN SUPPORT OF VICTORY AND AGAINST A PLAN FOR SURRENDER . WE HAVE NEW COMMANDERS IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY THAT I HAVE ADVOCATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS FAILED . ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNCERTAIN , WE MUST GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND ADEQUATE TIME TO SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST MISTAKES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT NOW WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , EMPOWER IRAN AND OTHER HOSTILE POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY PROVOKE GENOCIDE THERE , AND DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION AS NEIGHBORING POWERS COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAVORED FACTIONS . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY DRAW US INTO A WIDER AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD IMPOSE EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT . I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS -- AND THAT IS TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I POSSESS , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED SO WE CAN DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . THANK YOU FOR YOUR ATTENTION .
BLUE	THANK YOU ! THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH ! THANK YOU . YOU KNOW , I AM SO HAPPY TO BE BACK HERE AT FURMAN . I WAS AT FURMAN WITH DICK AND CHUCKY RILEY BACK IN 2003 FOR A SPEECH AND A QUESTION AND ANSWER PROGRAM THERE , AND I HAD SUCH A WONDERFUL TIME . IT'S GREAT TO BE HERE AGAIN ; I'VE BEEN AT ONE OF THE EXTENSION BUILDINGS OF THE UNIVERSITY IN THIS CAMPAIGN , BUT TO BE BACK AND TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES FACING OUR COUNTRY IS A GREAT HONOR . I AM SO SORRY TO BE LATE . I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT . SOME OF IT WAS US OFF TO A LATE START , BUT THERE WERE OTHER THINGS WE HAD TO DEAL WITH , AND SOME OF IT WAS DELAYS IN AIR TRAVEL , BUT I APPRECIATE YOUR PATIENCE AND YOUR WILLINGNESS TO BE HERE . I APOLOGIZE FOR EVERYBODY STUCK OUTSIDE ; WE HAVE A LONG , LONG LINE OF PEOPLE WHO CAN'T GET IN . I'M NOT SURE THAT EVERYBODY THOUGHT A SPEECH ABOUT THE ECONOMY WOULD DRAW SUCH A BIG CROWD . SO , I APOLOGIZE TO ALL OF YOU AS WELL . AND OF COURSE , I WANT TO THANK DICK RILEY FOR HIS YEARS OF SERVICE TO THE STATE OF SOUTH CAROLINA AND TO OUR COUNTRY . HE IS SUCH A UNIQUE PUBLIC SERVANT AND A WONDERFUL , GREAT MAN . AND I WANT TO THANK FRANK UNKNOWNWORD WHO WAS OUT SPEAKING HERE WITH YOU BEFORE , AND LOTTIE GIBSON . STATE REPRESENTATIVE FLETCHER SMITH , WHO I'M PROUD TO HAVE SUPPORTING ME . I WANT TO THANK THE CONFERENCE CENTER HERE AND UNKNOWNWORD CORNELISON , WHO IS THE DIRECTOR AND ALL OF YOU WHO HAVE COME . I PARTICULARLY WANT TO THANK A GROUP OF VETERANS WHO ARE TRAVELING THROUGHOUT THE STATE ON MY BEHALF . WE HAVE THEM ALL OVER THE STATE . WE HAVE SEVERAL OF THEM HERE TODAY , LED BY HERSHEL GOBER , THE FORMER SECRETARY OF VETERAN AFFAIRS ; HANK NAUGHTON , AN IRAQ VETERAN AND A STATE REPRESENTATIVE FROM MASSACHUSETTS ; PAT LEWIS , ANOTHER VETERAN ; REVEREND TIM BROWN , ANOTHER SUPPORTER . I'M VERY HONORED TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY OF OUR VETERANS . WE HAVE A LOT OF WORK TO DO ON THAT FRONT , AND IF YOU WANT TO KNOW THE DETAILS TALK TO HERSHEL AND THE VETERANS WHO ARE HERE , BECAUSE THEY CAN GIVE YOU CHAPTER AND UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO TO KEEP FAITH WITH OUR VETERANS . BUT I WANT TO TURN TO THE ECONOMY . YOU KNOW , IN JUST A FEW DAYS , ON MONDAY NIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH WILL GIVE HIS FINAL STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS . IT'S ENOUGH TO MAKE YOU WANT TO BURST OUT IN SONG . DON'T WORRY , I'LL SPARE YOU . YOU DON'T HAVE TO LISTEN TO ME SING . AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF INATTENTION , UNKNOWNWORD AND DENIAL , THIS MONDAY NIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH MAY WELL ACTUALLY DISCUSS THE SERIOUS ECONOMIC PROBLEMS WE FACE . AND IT'S ABOUT TIME . YOU KNOW , WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM WHEN THE TYPICAL FAMILY INCOMES DROPPED $1,000 OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS -- $2,600 FOR AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES . AS HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS NEARLY DOUBLED , GAS PRICES MORE THAN DOUBLED , AND COLLEGE COSTS HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ROSE UNKNOWNWORD % SINCE 2000 , THE FASTEST INCREASE IN AMERICA . WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM AS MORE THAN TWO MILLION FORECLOSURE NOTICES WENT OUT . 11,000 PROPERTIES RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ARE IN SOME STAGE OF FORECLOSURE . THAT'S 11,000 FAMILIES THAT ARE FACING THE POTENTIAL LOSS OF THE AMERICAN DREAM . WE DIDN'T HEAR FROM HIM AS UNEMPLOYMENT REACHED A TWO YEAR HIGH LAST MONTH , WITH SOUTH CAROLINA HAVING THE THIRD HIGHEST UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IN AMERICA , OR AS NEARLY FIVE MILLION AMERICANS FELL BACK INTO POVERTY . 33,000 IN SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE . BUT NOW , FINALLY , THE PRESIDENT MAY ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE KNOWN FOR YEARS : THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES . AND I WELCOME THE PRESIDENT TO THIS CONVERSATION . BECAUSE IT'S A CONVERSATION THAT AMERICANS HAVE BEEN HAVING AND THAT I'VE BEEN HAVING WITH SO MANY PEOPLE EVERY DAY FOR YEARS . I'VE LISTENED TO THE VOICES OF SO MANY AMERICANS AS I'VE TRAVELED THE COUNTRY . THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD ALL DAY . THEN SOMETIMES ADDITIONALLY ON THE NIGHT SHIFT . BUT IT'S STILL NOT ENOUGH . PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWNWORD TO ME ABOUT THE MORTGAGES THEY CAN'T AFFORD AND THE HOMES THEY'RE LOSING , ABOUT MEDICAL BILLS THAT WIPED THEM AND THEIR SAVINGS OUT . ABOUT TUITION COSTS THAT HAVE CUT SHORT THE HOPES THEY HAD ABOUT SENDING A CHILD TO COLLEGE . MANY PEOPLE ARE SIMPLY OVERWHELMED BY THE ECONOMIC CONDITIONS THEY CONFRONT EVERY DAY . I'VE HEARD FROM PLENTY OF PEOPLE WHO ALSO TELL ME , "I'M OK RIGHT NOW , BUT WHAT ABOUT NEXT YEAR . OR EVEN NEXT MONTH ? THE WAY THINGS ARE GOING WITH PEOPLE LOSING JOBS AND HOMES , WHAT IF MY FAMILY IS NEXT ?" THIS IS A TIME OF UNCERTAINTY AND GROWING ANXIETY . WE DIDN'T WIND UP HERE BY ACCIDENT . AS PRESIDENT KENNEDY ONCE OBSERVED , "ECONOMIC POLICY CAN RESULT FROM GOVERNMENT INACTION AS WELL AS GOVERNMENTAL ACTION ." WE'RE HERE IN PART BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT FAILED TO LISTEN TO THE VOICES OF PEOPLE WHO ARE HURTING , FAILED TO GET INVOLVED IN THE ACTUAL WORK OF RUNNING THE GOVERNMENT , AND FAILED TO ACT . INSTEAD , HE HAS STAYED AT A COMFORTABLE CRUISING UNKNOWNWORD , WELL ABOVE THE REALITIES OF PEOPLE'S LIVES , DELEGATING RESPONSIBILITIES TO HIS ADVISERS , HOPING THE BUCK WOULD STOP SOMEWHERE ELSE'ANYWHERE ELSE . IN JUST SEVEN YEARS , THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS TAKEN US FROM RECORD SURPLUSES INTO A LARGE AND GROWING DEFICIT , FROM A PROJECTED UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION SURPLUS TO A UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION DEBT . WE HAVE SEEN OUR GROWING , THRIVING ECONOMY THAT CREATED 22'7 MILLION JOBS IN THE 1990S PUSHED TO THE BRINK OF RECESSION . AND WE'RE SEEING THE RIPPLE EFFECTS AROUND THE WORLD . THIS WEEK , MANY COUNTRIES SAW THEIR LARGEST UNKNOWNWORD STOCK MARKET DECLINES SINCE SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 . IN THIS NEW CENTURY , THE STAKES HAVE NEVER BEEN HIGHER . THE CHALLENGES HAVE NEVER BEEN BIGGER OR MORE URGENT . BUT THE OPPORTUNITIES ARE ALSO THERE , IF WE GET ABOUT THE BUSINESS OF UNKNOWNWORD THEM . NOW , OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ARE ADMITTEDLY COMPLEX . BUT THERE IS ONE THING WE KNOW FOR SURE : THE PROBLEM WITH OUR ECONOMY IS NOT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . INSTEAD , THE PROBLEM IS , IN PART , THE BANKRUPT IDEAS THAT HAVE GOVERNED US FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . THEY HAVE REWARDED THE VERY FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MANY . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE ACTUALLY THE SOLUTION TO OUR ECONOMIC PROBLEMS . AMERICANS ARE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD . OUR PRODUCTIVITY GOES UP EVERY YEAR . THAT MEANS WE WORK HARDER AND HARDER AND PRODUCE MORE . PEOPLE ARE INNOVATORS , THEY ARE ENTREPRENEURS , THEY TAKE RISKS , THEY START SMALL BUSINESSES . THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD THINKING ABOUT THE FUTURE . THE FACTORY WORKER AND THE CEO , THE FARMER OR THE SMALL BUSINESS OWNER , THE SCIENTIST IN THE LAB , OR THE TEACHER IN THE CLASSROOM , EVERYBODY WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY AND GETS THEIR JOB DONE , SUPPORTS THEIR FAMILIES . THAT IS THE STRENGTH OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY . AND IT'S TIME WE FINALLY HAD A PRESIDENT WHO WORKED AS HARD FOR YOU AS YOU WORK FOR AMERICA EVERY SINGLE DAY . BECAUSE , IN THE END , IT IS ALL ABOUT PEOPLE . IT IS ALL ABOUT THE WOMAN IN COLUMBIA WHO GRABBED MY HAND AND SAID THAT HER CHILD WAS SICK AND THE INSURANCE COMPANY WOULDN'T PAY FOR THE TREATMENT THAT WAS NECESSARY . IT'S ALL ABOUT THE MAN IN FLORENCE SOME MONTHS AGO WHO CAME UP TO ME SOME MONTHS AGO AND SAID , "I JUST KEEP WORKING HARDER AND HARDER AND I FEEL LIKE I'M FALLING FURTHER AND FURTHER BACKWARDS . BUT I HAVE A SMALL BUSINESS ; I DEPEND ON TRANSPORTING MY GOODS , AND THE COST OF ENERGY JUST KEEPS GOING UP ." IT'S ABOUT THE REAL LIVES OF REAL PEOPLE RIGHT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA . THE PRESIDENCY MATTERS MORE NOW THAN EVER . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL RUN THE GOVERNMENT AND MANAGE THE ECONOMY . AMERICAN PEOPLE DON'T HIRE A PRESIDENT TO TALK ABOUT OUR PROBLEMS BUT TO SOLVE THEM , TO SET A VISION FOR THE FUTURE , AND THEN TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET ABOUT FULFILLING IT . IT'S TIME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES THAT LEADING AN ECONOMIC COMEBACK IS A FULLTIME , HANDS-ON JOB . WHO RENEWS OUR COMMITMENT TO A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS AND BRINGS BUSINESS , LABOR AND GOVERNMENT TOGETHER TO RESTORE AMERICA'S COMPETITIVENESS IN A FAST CHANGING WORLD . A PRESIDENT WHO HAS A VISION FOR A TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ECONOMY BASED ON SHARED PROSPERITY . WHERE WE MEASURE OUR SUCCESS NOT BY THE WEALTH AT THE VERY TOP BUT BY HOW BROADLY WEALTH IS SHARED . YOU KNOW , WITH ALL DUE RESPECT TO A LOT OF MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE AISLE , I DO NOT BELIEVE IT IS RICH PEOPLE WHO MADE AMERICA GREAT . I BELIEVE IT IS THE HARD WORKING PEOPLE OF AMERICA WHO MADE OUR COUNTRY GREAT . WE WANT TO GET BACK TO REWARDING HARD WORK . WE WANT THE AMERICAN DREAM TO BE WITHIN EVERYONE'S REACH . WE WANT TO MAKE INVESTMENTS IN ONE ANOTHER THAT ALLOW US , PARTICULARLY OUR CHILDREN , TO LIVE UP TO OUR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . THESE ARE NOT JUST ECONOMIC ISSUES , THESE ARE MORAL ISSUES ABOUT OUR COMMON PURPOSE AS A NATION . WHETHER PEOPLE CAN PROVIDE FOR THEIR FAMILIES , WHETHER THEY CAN SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS OF THIS GREAT COUNTRY . THAT SPEAKS TO WHO WE ARE AS A PEOPLE AND WHAT WE VALUE . THE WAY WE BRING OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER IS BY ACTING ON OUR VALUES . TRUE UNITY CAN ONLY BE ACHIEVED BY FINDING REAL SOLUTIONS FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND THEN DELIVERING THEM . WITHOUT REAL SOLUTIONS , DIVISION AND DISAPPOINTMENT , NOT UNITY , WILL BE THE RESULT . WE'VE BEEN THERE BEFORE . PRESIDENT BUSH PROMISED TO BE A UNITER , NOT A DIVIDER . AND WE KNOW HOW WELL THAT TURNED OUT . BECAUSE UNITY COMES FROM TAKING ON THE TOUGH CHALLENGES , ASKING US TO BE BIGGER THAN OURSELVES , SUMMONING UP TO GREATNESS , AGAIN . AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO DO AS PRESIDENT , ON DAY ONE . I WILL BRING THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BACK TO THE WHITE HOUSE . I WILL ASK ALL OF US TO BE INVOLVED IN SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS . OTHERWISE , HERE IS WHAT I FEAR . MOST OF US , AS I LOOK AROUND THIS ROOM , WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE STUDENTS WHO ARE CROWDED INTO THE FOYER AND SPILLING OUT THE DOOR , WE HAVE BEEN THE BENEFICIARIES OF THE SACRIFICES THAT CAME FROM PREVIOUS GENERATIONS - FROM PARENTS AND GRANDPARENTS , FROM PEOPLE WHO FOUGHT THE WARS , AND BUILT BIG BUSINESSES , AND DID THE LABOR , WHO CREATED THE EXTRAORDINARY SUCCESS OF THAT AMERICA IS . WE HAVE TO KEEP FAITH WITH ALL THAT CAME BEFORE US . I DON'T THINK ANY OF US WANT TO BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION OF AMERICANS TO LEAVE OUR COUNTRY WORSE OFF THAN WHEN WE FOUND IT . THAT WOULD BE SUCH A BREACH WITH WHAT AMERICAN HISTORY HAS MEANT TO ALL OF US . SO THE TIME FOR WAITING IS OVER AND THE TIME FOR TALK IS OVER . TOO MANY FAMILIES ARE PAYING THE PRICE OF INACTION , RIGHT HERE AND RIGHT NOW . SO I THINK WE NEED TO BEGIN ACTING , AND WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 20 , 2009 . WE NEED BOTH AN IMMEDIATE , SHORT-TERM PLAN TO JUMPSTART THE ECONOMY . AND A LONG-TERM ECONOMIC VISION WITH STRATEGIES TO KEEP THE ECONOMY GOING WELL INTO THE FUTURE . SO LET'S START WITH THE SHORT-TERM . IF I WERE PRESIDENT RIGHT NOW , I WOULD WORK WITH THE CONGRESS TO JUMPSTART THE ECONOMY BY IMMEDIATELY ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISIS , CREATING NEW JOBS , AND GETTING MONEY BACK INTO THE POCKETS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WE KNOW THAT THE LOSS OF A HOME IS DEVASTATING AND SO MANY FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY ARE FACING THAT . BUT IT'S NOT ONLY THOSE WHO ARE ACTUALLY LOSING THEIR HOMES I WORRY ABOUT . BECAUSE OF THIS MORTGAGE CRISIS , EVERY HOME OWNER IS LOSING VALUE IN OUR HOMES . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE LOST MORE THAN $1'3 TRILLION WORTH OF VALUE IN OUR HOMES IN THE LAST YEAR . THAT'S NEARLY HALF THE SIZE OF THE ENTIRE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT BUDGET . AND AFRICAN AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE ESPECIALLY HARD HIT . SUBPRIME LOANS ARE FIVE TIMES MORE COMMON IN PREDOMINANTLY AFRICAN AMERICAN NEIGHBORHOODS THAN PREDOMINANTLY WHITE ONES . BUT THIS IS NOT JUST AN ECONOMIC CRISIS , IT IS TRULY AN AMERICAN DREAM CRISIS . YOUR HOME ISN'T JUST YOUR ONLY GREATEST SOURCE OF WEALTH . IT'S YOUR GREATEST SOURCE OF SECURITY . IT'S WHAT ANCHORS US TO OUR NEIGHBORHOODS AND COMMUNITIES . IT'S WHERE WE RAISE OUR KIDS , CELEBRATE BIRTHDAYS AND HOLIDAYS , AND MAKE MEMORIES TOGETHER . I HAVE VISITED WITH SO MANY PEOPLE IN THEIR HOMES AND I KNOW WHAT OUR HOMES MEAN TO US . I KNOW THE FEEL OF REFUGE AND SECURITY I FEEL WHEN I WALK INTO MY OWN HOME . I KNOW WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SIT IN HOMES WHERE FAMILIES HAVEN'T HAD THE MONEY TO BUY ALL THE FURNITURE THEY NEED BUT THEY'RE SO PROUD TO SHOW OFF THEIR NEW HOME . AND NEARLY A YEAR AGO , I CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE ACTION TO ADDRESS THIS MOUNTING MORTGAGE CRISIS . LESS THAN TWO WEEKS AFTER THAT , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TOLD CONGRESS THAT WHAT I WAS CALLING FOR WASN'T NECESSARY - THAT THE PROBLEM WAS CONTAINED . SEVERAL MONTHS LATER , THE PRESIDENT ASSURED US THAT THERE WOULD BE A SOFT LANDING FOR THE HOUSING MARKET . BUT NOW WE KNOW BETTER . SO ALL OF LAST YEAR , I PROPOSED POLICIES TO HELP FAMILIES KEEP THEIR HOMES . I WROTE TO THE REGULATORS URGING THEM TO TAKE THEIR HEADS OUT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND DO SOMETHING FOR THE MILLIONS OF FAMILIES AT RISK OF FORECLOSURE . I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO CRACK DOWN ON ABUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES AND GIVE STATES THE RESOURCES TO HELP AT-RISK FAMILIES AVOID LOSING THEIR HOMES . THE RESULT ? A PLAN FROM PRESIDENT BUSH THAT LETS BANKS OFF THE HOOK AND LEAVES HOMEOWNERS TO FEND FOR THEMSELVES . IN THE WORDS OF ONE EXPERT , THE PRESIDENT'S PLAN WAS "THE BANK LOBBY'S DREAM ." THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS DELIVERED A FORECLOSURE NOTICE ON THE AMERICAN DREAM . THE PRESIDENT'S PLANS TO FIX OUR ECONOMY WOULD DO NEXT TO NOTHING ABOUT THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS . AND THEY SAID THAT MY INSISTENCE ON STOPPING FORECLOSURES JUST DOESN'T MAKE SENSE . WELL I'M SORRY TO DISAGREE . THE HOUSING CRISIS IS CONTRIBUTING TO RISING UNEMPLOYMENT . CONSTRUCTION JOBS ARE DISAPPEARING . AND I SEE A FEW UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN THE AUDIENCE . SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE LOST 2,800 CONSTRUCTION JOBS IN 2007 . IT'S ERASING FAMILIES . WEALTH , JEOPARDIZING CONSUMER SPENDING , WHICH CONSTITUTES TWO-THIRDS OF OUR ECONOMY . IT'S CAUSED $100 BILLION IN LOSSES TO BANKS , MAKING THEM LESS LIKELY TO OFFER CREDIT TO BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES THAT NEED IT . THAT'S WHY MY PLAN TO FIX THE ECONOMY STARTS BY DOING EVERYTHING POSSIBLE TO ENSURE THAT WE DON'T LOSE ANY MORE HOMES AND THAT WE STABILIZE THE ECONOMY WHEN IT COMES TO THE MORTGAGE CRISIS . I WANT TO START WITH A 90-DAY MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES . IF THE BANK IS ABOUT TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOME , YOU SHOULD HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR MORTGAGE . I'M CALLING FOR UNKNOWNWORD THE MONTHLY RATE ON ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES FOR AT LEAST FIVE YEARS OR UNTIL THE MORTGAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO LOANS THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD . IF YOU HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE MORTGAGE THAT'S ABOUT TO SKYROCKET , YOU'LL HAVE THE CHANCE TO PAY IT OFF WITH AFFORDABLE PAYMENTS . PEOPLE SAY WELL ISN'T THIS REWARDING PEOPLE WHO MAYBE GOT IN OVER THEIR HEADS ? WELL TO SOME EXTENT IT IS TRYING TO STOP WHAT IS HAPPENING THAT WILL AFFECT ALL OF US . IF WE DON'T HELP THESE FAMILIES WORK OUT THEIR MORTGAGES NOW WE WILL HAVE MORE EMPTY HOMES BECAUSE THE HOUSING MARKET IS SO LOW RIGHT NOW , NOBODY IS BUYING . THEN WE'LL HAVE DETERIORATING NEIGHBORHOODS , THEN WE'LL HAVE DECREASING TAX REVENUES FOR CITIES AND TOWNS - IT BECOMES A VICIOUS CYCLE . THAT'S WHY I ALSO WOULD ALSO CREATE A $30 BILLION FUND TO HELP HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES AND DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS WEATHER THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS . WE NEED TO BE SURE TO SHORE UP OUR COMMUNITIES SO THAT THEY DON'T BEGIN TO ALSO DETERIORATE IN THE FACE OF A LOSS IN THE HOME MARKET . I ALSO WOULD INCLUDE DIRECT TAX REBATES TO WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES . WE NEED TO TARGET IT TO THOSE WHO ARE MOST IN NEED . THE DEMOCRATIC LEADERSHIP IN THE HOUSE AND SENATE ALONG WITH THE WHITE HOUSE APPEAR TO BE NEARING A DEAL AND I AM HEARTENED TO HEAR THAT THEY ARE PLANNING TO EXTEND ASSISTANCE TO THE TENS OF MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS WHO NEED IT THE MOST . THAT'S WHAT I HAVE BEEN CALLING FOR AND THAT'S WHAT I THINK WE HAVE TO DO . BUT I ALSO WANT TO TARGET THE NEEDS OF WORKING FAMILIES THAT ARE REALLY FACING TOUGH CHOICES . WE NEED RELIEF FROM SKYROCKETING ENERGY BILLS . WE NEED EXPANDED UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE FOR THOSE WHO ARE STRUGGLING TO FIND A JOB . BUT I WANT TO THINK ABOUT THE FUTURE , THAT'S WHY I WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO UNKNOWNWORD "GREEN COLLAR " JOB GROWTH : HIGH-WAGE , RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS THAT ARE GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT AND CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED . I WOULD DO THIS IMMEDIATELY THROUGH A CRASH WEATHERIZATION PROGRAM THAT WOULD PUT PEOPLE TO WORK , HELPING TO INSULATE HOMES , AND GIVE GREEN COLLAR JOB TRAINING INITIATIVES TO HELP PREPARE PEOPLE . I WOULD ALSO IMPLEMENT MY GREEN BUILDING FUND TO REBUILD AND RENOVATE SCHOOLS AND OTHER PUBLIC BUILDINGS TO HELP MAKE THEM MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT . WE CAN CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS IN AMERICA THROUGH CLEAN , RENEWABLE ENERGY . I KNOW WE CAN DO IT BECAUSE I'VE SEEN WHAT OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE DONE . GERMANY DECIDED A FEW YEARS AGO TO MAKE A BIG BET ON SOLAR POWER . THEY CREATING TAX INCENTIVES , THEY CREATED TRAINING PROGRAMS TO TAKE CONSTRUCTION WORKERS AND OTHERS TO KNOW HOW TO INSTALL SOLAR PANELS . THEY HAVE CREATED SEVERAL HUNDRED THOUSAND NEW JOBS IN THREE SHORT YEARS . THEY HAVE A SMALLER ECONOMY THAN OURS . IF WE GOT SERIOUS ABOUT THIS , I KNOW WE COULD DO THE SAME . I REALLY HOPE THAT AS PART OF THIS RECOVERY PACKAGE , WE START GETTING SERIOUS ABOUT THE FUTURE . WE HAVE TO STOP THE CRISIS BUT THEN WE HAVE TO PLAN FOR AN ECONOMY THAT WILL KEEP GENERATING GOOD NEW JOBS , AND CLEAN ENERGY IS OUR BEST BET . BUT UNKNOWNWORD THE ECONOMY IN THE SHORT-TERM IS JUST THE BEGINNING . WE NEED A LONG-TERM VISION TO BUILD A STRONG , PROSPEROUS ECONOMY FOR THE NEXT GENERATION . I THINK IT WAS WINSTON CHURCHILL WHO SAID THAT , THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A POLITICIAN AND A STATESMAN IS THAT THE POLITICIAN THINKS ABOUT THE NEXT ELECTION , WHILE THE STATESMAN THINKS ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION . WE'VE GOT TO START THINKING ABOUT THE NEXT GENERATION . WE CAN'T DO THIS PIECEMEAL ; WE'VE GOT TO START HELPING PEOPLE MORE . MAYBE YOU WANT TO START SAVING FOR RETIREMENT , BUT YOU CAN'T DO IT BECAUSE YOUR TAXES ARE TOO HIGH AND YOUR WAGES AREN'T HIGH ENOUGH . MAYBE YOU WANT TO GO BACK TO SCHOOL , BUT YOUR HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS ARE TOO HIGH SO YOU CAN'T AFFORD TUITION . WE LIVE IN A COMPLEX , INTERCONNECTED , GLOBAL ECONOMY . ALL OF OUR CHALLENGES ARE ALL TOGETHER NOW . WE CAN'T JUST PUT BAND-AIDS ON ONE AND EXPECT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS . WHAT WE HAVE TO DO IS HAVE A PLAN TO CREATE GOOD JOBS AND RESTORE FAIRNESS TO THE ECONOMY . WE NEED TO RENEW THE PROMISE OF AMERICA THAT IF YOU WORK HARD , YOU CAN GET AHEAD . WE NEED TO RETURN TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY , SO THAT WASHINGTON ONCE AGAIN LIVES WITHIN A BUDGET , JUST LIKE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAS TO DO . I BELIEVE SOLVING THE JOBS CRISIS OVER THE LONG RUN STARTS WITH SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS . THAT'S WHY I WILL CREATE A $50 BILLION STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND TO JUMPSTART INVESTMENTS IN CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES . WE WILL CREATE A GREEN REVOLUTION WITH INVESTMENTS IN BIOFUELS , WIND , SOLAR , GEOTHERMAL , ALL OF THE CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE . AND AS WE CREATE THESE NEW JOB POSSIBILITIES FOR THE NEXT GENERATION WE WILL PAY FOR IT BY ELIMINATING THE TAX SUBSIDIES FOR THE BIG OIL COMPANIES AND REQUIRE THEM TO PAY INTO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND , OR INVEST IN ALTERNATIVE ENERGY THEMSELVES . THEY HAVE MADE RECORD PROFITS IN RECENT YEARS . NOW IT'S TIME THEY DID THEIR FAIR SHARE . I ALSO KNOW THAT WE WON'T GET ANY OF THIS DONE UNTIL THE TWO OIL MEN LEAVE THE WHITE HOUSE BUT AS SOON AS THEY DO , WE WILL START TO WORK ON THIS LONG-TERM VISION . WE ALSO HELP CREATE JOBS BY MODERNIZING AND REBUILDING OUR CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE . THE TRAGIC BRIDGE COLLAPSE IN UNKNOWNWORD THIS PAST SUMMER , A RECENT LEVEE BREAK IN NEVADA , AND WHAT HAPPENED WITH THE LEVEES IN NEW ORLEANS ARE PAINFUL UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR INFRASTRUCTURE IS IN DANGEROUS DISREPAIR . EVERY BILLION DOLLARS THAT WE SPEND FIXING CRUMBLING INFRASTRUCTURE CREATES 48,000 NEW JOBS . I HAVE A REBUILD AMERICA PLAN TO INVEST $10 BILLION OVER TEN YEARS IN AN "EMERGENCY REPAIR FUND ." WE NEED TO MODERNIZE OUR PORTS , OUR RAIL SYSTEMS , OUR AIRPORTS , OUR PUBLIC TRANSIT SYSTEMS , OUR BRIDGES , OUR TUNNELS , OUR ROADS . WE NEED TO EXPAND ACCESS TO BROADBAND ACROSS AMERICA , PARTICULARLY TO RURAL AREAS . WE NEED TO END THIS ADMINISTRATION'S WAR ON SCIENCE AND RESTORE AMERICA TO ITS RIGHTFUL PLACE . AS THE INNOVATION NATION , I WILL INCREASE INVESTMENTS IN BASIC AND APPLIED RESEARCH AT THE NATIONAL SCIENCE FOUNDATION , THE NATIONAL INSTITUTES OF HEALTH AND OUR OTHER GOVERNMENT AGENCIES AND UNIVERSITIES . WE BECAME SO SUCCESSFUL AFTER WORLD WAR II BECAUSE BUSINESS AND SCIENCE WORKED HAND IN HAND WITH GOVERNMENT . OUR GREAT UNIVERSITIES LIKE FURMAN WERE ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF DISCOVERIES THAT WE TRANSLATED INTO BETTER OUTCOMES FOR PEOPLE . BUT CREATING JOBS IS JUST THE BEGINNING . WE NEED TO EMPOWER OUR WORKERS AND ENSURE THAT OUR TAX SYSTEM IS FAIR . THAT'S THE SECOND PIECE OF A LONG-TERM PLAN . FOR THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , THE OIL COMPANIES , THE PREDATORY STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES , THE INSURANCE COMPANIES , THE DRUG COMPANIES HAVE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR THEM . I INTEND TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY ABOUT HOW WE MAKE AMERICA WORK BETTER FOR YOU . DURING THE 1950S AND 60S WHICH MANY OF US LOOK BACK AT WITH GREAT APPRECIATION BECAUSE THE ECONOMY WORKED SO WELL , FOR SO LONG , FOR SO MANY , WE HAD A MUCH HIGHER PERCENTAGE OF OUR WORKFORCE UNIONIZED . NOW IT IS MUCH LOWER . WE NEED TO MAKE SURE PEOPLE CAN ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN FOR GOOD WAGES AND SAFE WORKING CONDITIONS . WE NEED TO BE SURE THAT WE RESTORE FAIRNESS TO THE ECONOMY BY RESTORING FAIRNESS TO THE TAX CODE . RIGHT NOW , SOME OF THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT IN NEW YORK CITY , WALL STREET INVESTMENT MANAGERS , MAKING $50 MILLION A YEAR PAY JUST 15 % ON THEIR EARNINGS . WHILE A TEACHER MAKING $50,000 PAYS 25 UNKNOWNWORD I DON'T THINK THAT'S RIGHT AND I'VE BEEN CALLING TO RAISE THE TAXES ON THOSE PEOPLE AT THE TOP . AS CORPORATE PROFITS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , THE PERCENTAGE OF TAXES PAID BY CORPORATIONS HAS FALLEN . WE HAVE RICHLY REWARDED PEOPLE AND I AM ALL IN FAVOR OF INCENTIVIZING PEOPLE TO DO WELL . THAT IS PART OF WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR . BUT IT ISN'T RIGHT THAT THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED HAVE GOTTEN SO MANY MORE BENEFITS THAN THE MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING PEOPLE HAVE . WE NEED TO EXTEND MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS , INCLUDING THE CHILD TAX CREDIT , MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF . WE NEED TO REFORM THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX TO ENSURE IT DOESN'T HIT MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES WITH HIGHER TAX RATES . IT WAS NEVER SUPPOSED TO DO THAT . WE NEED TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT AND RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO ENSURE THAT WORK PAYS FOR ALL AMERICANS . NO ONE WHO WORKS FULL TIME SHOULD LIVE IN POVERTY . IF YOU'RE WORKING FULL TIME YOU SHOULDN'T BE IN POVERTY . WE NEED TO GIVE PEOPLE THE TOOLS AND SUPPORT THEY NEED TO SUCCEED IN TODAY'S COMPLEX ECONOMY . THAT STARTS WITH RECOMMITTING OURSELVES TO MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR OUR YOUNG PEOPLE . THAT'S ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA , THE AVERAGE STUDENT DEBT UPON UNKNOWNWORD IS $20,000 . SO YOU START IN A BIG HOLE BEFORE YOU EVER GO TO WORK ON THE FIRST DAY . AND YOU KNOW WHAT'S HAPPENED WHICH IS REALLY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD HIGHER EDUCATION SYSTEM WHICH WAS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD , WE HAD AN OPEN SYSTEM , THE HIGHEST PERCENTAGE OF YOUNG PEOPLE WHO WENT TO GET DEGREES , BUT NOW FROM JAPAN TO SOUTH KOREA TO CANADA AND IRELAND , OTHER COUNTRIES ARE EDUCATING THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE AT A HIGHER RATE THAN HERE IN AMERICA . THE REASON FOR THAT IS THE COST HAS UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS MORE EXPENSIVE TODAY THAN IT WAS THIRTY YEARS AGO TO SEND A CHILD TO COLLEGE . THAT'S WHY I'VE OUTLINED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO OPEN THE DOORS OF COLLEGE TO YOUNG PEOPLE . IT INCLUDES A NEW $3,500 COLLEGE TAX CREDIT THAT WILL COVER MORE THAN 50 % OF THE TYPICAL COST OF PUBLIC COLLEGES AND UNIVERSITIES OR THE FULL COST OF TUITION AND FEES FOR COMMUNITY COLLEGES . I ALSO WANT TO INCREASE THE SIZE OF PELL GRANTS , SOMETHING THAT FORMER SECRETARY RILEY MENTIONED . I WANT TO STRENGTHEN COMMUNITY COLLEGES , INVEST $500 MILLION TO SUPPORT INNOVATIVE , ON-THE-JOB TRAINING AND APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS FOR THOSE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE . WE ALSO HAVE TO ENSURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN HAS QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE . HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA ALONE , 672,000 PEOPLE ARE UNINSURED . I WANT TO ASK YOU . HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEONE HERE IN SOUTH CAROLINA WHO IS UNINSURED ? HOW MANY OF YOU KNOW SOMEBODY WHO MAY HAVE INSURANCE BUT IT JUST DOESN'T PAY FOR WHAT THE DOCTOR OR THE HOSPITAL SAYS YOU NEED ? WE HAVE TWO PROBLEMS'WE HAVE THE PROBLEM OF THE UNINSURED AND THE PROBLEM OF THE UNDERINSURED . MY AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN WOULD UNKNOWNWORD EVERY SINGLE PERSON FOR WHAT THEY NEED . IT'S SIMPLE : IF YOU HAVE INSURANCE YOU LIKE , YOU KEEP IT . THERE IS NO DISRUPTION . IF YOU HAVE A GOOD POLICY THROUGH YOUR BUSINESS OR THROUGH A UNION OR THROUGH A MUNICIPALITY , NOTHING CHANGES . BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE INSURANCE . OR YOU DON'T LIKE THE INSURANCE YOU HAVE . YOU CAN CHOOSE FROM THE SAME MENU OF PRIVATE PLANS AVAILABLE TO MEMBERS OF CONGRESS . AND WE WILL PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO HELP YOU AFFORD IT . MY PLAN ALSO BANS INSURANCE COMPANY DISCRIMINATION , SO YOU WILL NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF UNKNOWNWORD CONDITIONS OR RISK FACTORS THAT YOU MIGHT HAVE . AND WE DON'T REQUIRE SMALL BUSINESS TO DO ANYTHING BUT IT DOES PROVIDE TAX CREDITS TO HELP SMALL BUSINESSES IF THEY CHOOSE TO AFFORD TO BUY HEALTH CARE FOR THEIR EMPLOYEES . FINALLY , WE HAVE TO HELP MORE AMERICANS SAVE FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT . RIGHT NOW , FEWER THAN HALF OF ALL AMERICANS HAVE ANY RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNT AT ALL . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , I WANT TO PROVIDE EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WITH AN EASY , AUTOMATIC OPPORTUNITY TO SAVE FOR THE FUTURE THROUGH "AMERICAN RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS ." THESE ACCOUNTS WILL TAKE THE BEST OF THE UNKNOWNWORD PLANS AND MAKE THEM AVAILABLE TO EVERY WORKING FAMILY . AND WE'LL GIVE FAMILIES UP TO $1,000 IN TAX CUTS TO HELP THEM SAVE . AND FINALLY WE'VE GOT TO RETURN TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY . YEAR AFTER YEAR , THE PRESIDENT HAS INCREASED SPENDING AT MORE THAN DOUBLE THE RATE OF THE PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATION AND HANDED TAX CUT AFTER TAX CUT TO MULTI-MILLIONAIRES , OIL COMPANIES AND OTHER INTEREST GROUPS . AND HOW HAS HE PAID FOR ALL OF THIS SPENDING ? BY BORROWING MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA . WHEN PEOPLE ASK ME , WHY IS IT HARD TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA AND ENFORCE OUR TRADE AGREEMENTS , I TELL THEM : BECAUSE THEY'RE OUR BANKERS . WE OWE THEM . HOW CAN WE TRULY ENFORCE THE TRADE LAWS AGAINST A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA , WHEN OUR ECONOMY DEPENDS ON CHINA'S MASSIVE LOANS TO US ? THINK ABOUT IT THIS WAY , WE BORROW MONEY FROM CHINA TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS . THAT IS A DEAD-END STRATEGY FOR AMERICA . AND I'M GOING TO END THAT STRATEGY IF I HAVE THE GOOD FORTUNE OF BECOMING YOUR PRESIDENT . BECAUSE I WANT AMERICA TO REGAIN CONTROL OF ITS DESTINY BY MOVING BACK TOWARD A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS . THAT'S WHY I'VE WORKED THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN TO SHOW EXACTLY HOW I WOULD PAY FOR EVERY INITIATIVE THAT I HAVE JUST MENTIONED . NOT JUST HOW I'LL RUN MY CAMPAIGN , BUT RUN OUR COUNTRY AS WELL . YOU KNOW , TODAY , SOME PEOPLE AROUND THE WORLD AND EVEN SOME HERE AT HOME ARE BASICALLY SAYING , "WELL , WE CAN'T GO BACK TO THE KIND OF ECONOMY WE HAD BEFORE ." THEY ACT AS THOUGH THE 1990S WAS ANCIENT ROME . IT WORKED WELL IN THE 1990S . THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAD A $7,000 GAIN IN INCOME IN THE 1990S . WELL , EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE BUT I DO THINK THERE ARE LESSONS WE NEED TO LEARN FROM THE PAST . BECAUSE RIGHT NOW , WE ARE ON THE WRONG TRACK . WE ARE UNDERMINING OUR SECURITY AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . WE ARE UNDERMINING THE AMERICAN DREAM HERE AT HOME . YOU KNOW , GREAT PRESIDENTS HAVE ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THE GREATNESS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THINK ABOUT PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT . FACED WITH A DEPRESSION , GRAVE THREATS TO AMERICA'S FREEDOM , HE RESPONDED WITH BOLD SOLUTIONS . YES , THEY WERE SOMETIMES CONTROVERSIAL , BUT WE ROSE FROM ECONOMIC CHAOS AND DESPAIR AND AT THE TIME HE DIED WE WERE MONTHS AWAY FROM WINNING A WORLD WAR . HE DIDN'T PAINT A ROSY SCENARIO . HE DIDN'T IGNORE THE TOUGH CHALLENGES . HE URGED US TO CONFRONT THEM . "WE HAVE A GREAT MANY PROBLEMS AHEAD OF US ," HE SAID . "AND WE MUST APPROACH THEM WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND COURAGE ." HE BELIEVED WE COULD TACKLE OUR GREATEST CHALLENGES , AND I BELIEVE EXACTLY THE SAME . WE HAVE TO OVERCOME THE FEAR AND FATALISM THAT PRESIDENT BUSH HAS USED TO DIVIDE US AND SET US AGAINST ONE ANOTHER . WHEN I SOMETIMES HERE THE PRESIDENT OR THE VICE PRESIDENT , I DON'T HEAR AMERICA TALKING . YOU KNOW , "WE CAN'T SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS WITHOUT WRECKING OUR ECONOMY ; WE CAN'T PROVIDE AFFORDABLE QUALITY HEALTHCARE WITHOUT WRECKING OUR HEALTHCARE SYSTEM ; WE CAN'T HAVE AN ECONOMY ANYMORE THAT CREATES A RISING STANDARD OF LIVING FOR EVERYBODY WILLING TO WORK HARD ." SINCE WHEN DID AMERICA BECOME THE CAN'T-DO COUNTRY ? THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE KNOW AND LOVE . WE ARE GOING TO FACE THE FUTURE WITH OUR OPTIMISM , WITH OUR FAITH , OUR BELIEF THAT WE CAN OVERCOME ANY CHALLENGE . I AM OPTIMISTIC . I KNOW WE ARE FACING SOME TOUGH , TOUGH ISSUES . I THINK ABOUT IT EVERY DAY . I'M ASKING THE PEOPLE OF SOUTH CAROLINA TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME , JUST LIKE I ASKED THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME BACK IN 2000 . I CAME AND SAID , "IF YOU WILL GIVE ME A CHANCE , I WILL WORK MY HEART OUT FOR YOU . YOU WILL HAVE SOMEONE WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY , THINKING ABOUT YOU . I AM NOT A SHOW HORSE , I'M A WORK HORSE ; AND I WILL GO TO WORK FOR YOU ." BUT I'M NOT GOING TO DO IT ALONE . I CAN'T DO IT ALONE . WE ALL HAVE TO BE IN THIS TOGETHER . YOU KNOW , WHEN I TALK ABOUT A CLEAN , GREEN RENEWABLE ENERGY FUTURE , I'M GOING TO ASK ALL FOR YOU TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT , TO THINK ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS WHEN YOU KEEP THE LIGHTS ON , WHEN YOU DRIVE MORE THAN MAYBE YOU NEED TO , MAKING THREE TRIPS TO THE MALL INSTEAD OF ONE SENSIBLE ONE . I WANT YOU TO THINK ABOUT EVERY TIME YOU FILL UP THE GAS TANK , OR LEAVE THOSE LIGHTS ON , YOU'RE SENDING MONEY TO OIL COMPANIES AND OIL PRODUCING COUNTRIES THAT DON'T ALWAYS HAVE OUR BEST INTERESTS AT HEART . WHEN I SAY WE NEED A NEW APPROACH TO HEALTHCARE THAT PROVIDES QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTHCARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN , I'M GOING TO ASK YOU TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF YOUR HEALTH AND THE HEALTH OF YOUR CHILDREN . BECAUSE WE CAN HAVE THE BEST HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IN THE WORLD BUT WE'VE GOT TO BE HEALTHIER . WE'VE NEED A SYSTEM OF WELLNESS , NOT ONE THAT JUST INTERVENES WITH SICKNESS . WE'VE GOT TO BE ONCE AGAIN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT ARE ON THE FRONT LINES OF CHANGE AND PROGRESS TOGETHER . WE ARE THE OLDEST DEMOCRACY IN THE WORLD FOR A REASON . BECAUSE WHENEVER TIMES ARE TOUGH , WHENEVER THE CHALLENGES ARE BIG AND THE STAKES ARE HUGE . WE ALWAYS RESPOND . NOW , WINSTON CHURCHILL ALSO SAID THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE FINALLY GET AROUND TO DOING THE RIGHT THING AFTER TRYING NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE . WELL , WE'VE TRIED NEARLY EVERYTHING ELSE OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS , AND I THINK WE'VE LEARNED OUR LESSON . SO NOW WHAT WE NEED TO DO IS FACE THE FUTURE REALISTICALLY , COURAGEOUSLY , CONFIDENTLY , AND OPTIMISTICALLY . I KNOW WE CAN DO THIS TOGETHER . I NEED YOUR HELP IN THE PRIMARY ON UNKNOWNWORD . I NEED YOU TO VOTE NOT JUST FOR ME BUT FOR YOURSELVES , YOUR FAMILY , AND YOUR FUTURE . I AM READY TO LEAD ON DAY ONE , AND IF YOU GIVE ME THAT OPPORTUNITY , WE WILL RESTORE PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN OUR COUNTRY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH .
BLUE	IT IS A DANGEROUS MISSION TO FOLLOW REVEREND YOUNGBLOOD . THERE ISN'T ANYONE WHO HAS NOT ONLY PREACHED FOR JUSTICE BUT STOOD FOR JUSTICE AS HE HAS OVER SO MANY YEARS AND WE ARE SO GRATEFUL FOR HIS LEADERSHIP AND HIS WITNESS . I AM HONORED TO BE WITH YOU AND WITH ALL OF THESE LEADERS HERE BEFORE YOU . IT A PLEASURE TO BE CELEBRATING DR . KING'S LIFE AND TO CARRY FORTH HIS VISION , TO DO SO ON BEHALF OF THOSE WHO DESERVE ECONOMIC JUSTICE . I WANT TO START WITH A THANK YOU . FOR EIGHT YEARS I HAVE BEEN IN AND OUT OF MANY OF THE BUILDINGS THAT YOU SECURE . I HAVE SHOOK MANY OF YOUR HANDS ; I HAVE UNKNOWNWORD YOU FOR YOUR WORK . I HAVE BREATHED A SIGH OF RELIEF THAT YOU WERE THERE AND ON THE JOB AND I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THE WORK IS THAT YOU DO . LET ME , ON BEHALF OF SO MANY WHO APPRECIATE YOU AND UNDERSTAND THAT YOU DESERVE A LIVING WAGE WITH HEALTH CARE BENEFITS , BECAUSE YOU DO WORK THAT BENEFITS ALL OF US . THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU FOR ALL THAT YOU DO FOR ALL OF US EVERY SINGLE DAY . I WANT TO THANK THE LEADERSHIP OF 32 BJ , MIKE FISHMAN AND THE GREAT LEADERSHIP TEAM THAT HE HAS . I WANT TO THANK ALL THE CLERGY WHO ARE HERE . I WANT TO THANK BCT FOR BEING BEHIND THIS IMPORTANT CAUSE . YOU'VE HEARD FROM OUR WONDERFUL ELECTED OFFICIALS , GREG MEEKS WHO JUST LEFT , BILL UNKNOWNWORD , ANTHONY WEINER . WE KNOW HOW MUCH HAZEL DUKES HAS MEANT TO ALL OF US FOR SO MANY YEARS . SHE'S MY FRIEND , SHE'S MY MENTOR . I AM HERE TODAY BECAUSE OF YOU AND BECAUSE THE WORK THAT DR . KING STARTED AND THE WORK HE WAS DOING WHEN HIS LIFE WAS CUT SHORT IS DIRECTLY RELATED TO YOUR CAUSE . YOU'RE ORGANIZING , MOBILIZING , YOUR REFUSING TO BACK DOWN WHEN THE GOING GETS HARD . EVERYDAY THAT YOU STAND UP AND SPEAK FOR JUSTICE , YOU ARE THE LIVING EMBODIMENT OF DR . KING'S LEGACY . HE MAY NOT BE HERE , AS REVEREND YOUNGBLOOD SAID , IN PERSON BUT HE IS HERE IN SPIRIT BECAUSE WE ARE BRINGING TOGETHER THOSE WHO LABOR HARD EVERYDAY AND THE FAITH COMMUNITY THAT UNDERSTANDS THE CAUSE FOR WHICH YOU LABOR ; THE CAUSE OF JUSTICE AND RIGHTEOUSNESS . THE LEGACY THAT YOU EMBODY MAY BE DIFFERENT FROM THE JOBS OF THE SANITATION WORKERS IN MEMPHIS , BUT THE CAUSE , THE CAUSE , IS THE SAME . YOU MAY BE NEW TO THIS COUNTRY . YOU MAY NOT HAVE EVER CELEBRATED DR . KING'S HOLIDAY BEFORE , BUT HIS CAUSE AND HIS SACRIFICE , NO MATTER WHERE YOU CAME FROM , IS YOURS . YOU MAY BE A SECURITY GUARD WORKING TO KEEP BODY AND SOUL TOGETHER , WORRIED HOW YOU ARE GOING TO PUT FOOD ON THE TABLE AND HEALTH CARE FOR YOUR CHILDREN AND MAYBE SAVE A LITTLE ALONG THE WAY . YOU MAY HAVE BEEN BORN AFTER DR . KING LEFT US , BUT YOUR CAUSE IS HIS . WHEN I THINK ABOUT HOW MUCH STRONGER WE ARE WHEN WE JOIN FORCES , IT IS FOR ME THE PROGRESS THAT AMERICA HAS MADE ; PEOPLE OF FAITH COMING TOGETHER WITH PEOPLE OF LABOR . BACK IN 1968 , DR . KING SENT A TELEGRAM TO THE LABOR LEADER CESAR CHAVEZ . HE WAS UNKNOWNWORD A HUNGER STRIKE ON BEHALF OF FARM WORKERS . DR . KING WROTE , "OUR SEPARATE STRUGGLES ARE REALLY ONE ; A STRUGGLE FOR FREEDOM , FOR DIGNITY , AND FOR HUMANITY ." THAT IS WHY , THAT VERY SAME YEAR , DR . KING TRAVELED TO MEMPHIS , TENNESSEE AND OFFERED HIS SUPPORT TO STRIKING SANITATION WORKERS . HE TOLD THEM , "EITHER WE GO UP TOGETHER , OR WE GO DOWN TOGETHER ." THE CAUSE FOR JUSTICE HAS ALWAYS COME FROM PEOPLE OF FAITH AND PEOPLE OF LABOR . HERE IN THIS GREAT HALL TODAY , YOU UNDERSTAND , AS DR . KING DID , THAT YOUR CAUSE WAS HIS CAUSE . HIS MOVEMENT WAS A BROAD AND DEEP ONE . IT WAS A MOVEMENT TO REDEEM THE SOUL OF AMERICA ; TO FULFILL THE COMMON PURPOSE OF OUR NATION . A MOVEMENT INSPIRED BY THE IDEA , AS HE PUT IT , THAT "INJUSTICE ANYWHERE IS A THREAT TO JUSTICE EVERYWHERE ," AND THAT INCLUDED ECONOMIC JUSTICE . THE INJUSTICE OF POVERTY ; THE INJUSTICE OF PEOPLE WHO WORK HARD ALL DAY AND THEN ON THE NIGHT SHIFT , AND IT IS STILL NOT ENOUGH . THE INJUSTICE OF BEING INVISIBLE IN A COUNTRY OF SO MUCH WEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY ; HAVING PEOPLE WALK BY YOU IN THE HALLS AND UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF BUILDINGS YOU WORK AND NOT EVEN SEE YOU . NOT STOPPING TO SAY THANK YOU . THANK YOU FOR BEING ON DUTY TONIGHT . THANK YOU FOR TELLING US ABOUT THE PROBLEM THAT HAPPENED YESTERDAY . THANK YOU FOR HELPING ME TO FEEL SECURE . THAT INVISIBILITY EATS AWAY AT THE HEART AND SOUL OF AMERICA . THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS AND IF IT'S UP TO THE FAITH COMMUNITY AND THE LABOR COMMUNITY AND POLITICAL LEADERS LIKE THOSE OF US HERE TODAY , THERE WILL NOT BE INVISIBLE WORKERS ANYWHERE , EVER AGAIN . WE SEE SO MUCH INJUSTICE IN AN ECONOMY THAT SIMPLY ISN'T WORKING FOR SO MANY OF OUR FAMILIES . TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY'S INCOME IS DOWN NEARLY $1,000 IN THE LAST SIX YEARS . WAGES ARE FLAT BUT HEALTH CARE COSTS ARE UP . GAS AND ENERGY ARE UP , EDUCATION COSTS ARE UP . PEOPLE ARE RUNNING AS HARD THEY CAN BUT THEY ARE GOING BACKWARDS , THEY ARE NOT GETTING AHEAD . SO MANY FAMILIES FEEL LIKE THEY ARE STANDING ON A UNKNOWNWORD DOOR ; ONE PINK SLIP , ONE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AWAY FROM LOSING EVERYTHING . THE CAUSE OF YOUR FAMILY IS THE CAUSE OF EVERY AMERICAN FAMILY AND SHOULD BE THE CAUSE OF ALL OF US . WHEN SECURITY WORKERS HERE IN NEW YORK - THE PEOPLE WHO KEEP OUR CITY SAFE - DON'T HAVE THE HEALTH CARE OR THE TRAINING THEY NEED AND DESIRE ; WHEN THEY'RE NOT PAID ENOUGH OR VALUED ENOUGH - THEIR CAUSE IS OUR CAUSE . WHEN AFRICAN AMERICAN AND LATINO WORKERS STILL FACE DISCRIMINATION IN THE WORKPLACE - WHEN THEIR CHILDREN STILL ATTEND SCHOOLS THAT ARE SEPARATE AND UNEQUAL . WHEN THEY CANNOT FEEL THAT THEY ARE PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM TODAY , THEN YOUR CAUSE IS OUR CAUSE . WHEN A UNKNOWNWORD WOMAN IS TOLD , "I'M SORRY , BUT YOUR EMPLOYMENT IS NO LONGER NEEDED ." WHEN WOMEN ARE STILL PAID JUST 77 CENTS ON EVERY DOLLAR A MAN MAKES - AND WOMEN OF COLOR EVEN LESS , YOUR CAUSE IS OUR CAUSE . WE NEED TO BE RECOMMITTED TO DR . KING'S DREAM . IT WAS A DREAM THAT DEMANDED ACTION AND HE GAVE THAT ACTION EVERYDAY OF HIS LIFE UNTIL HE WAS TAKEN FROM US . WE MUST DEMAND THAT EVERY AMERICAN SHARE IN THIS NATION'S PROSPERITY . EVERY AMERICAN , NO MATTER WHERE YOU START OUT , SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO FULFILL YOUR GOD GIVEN POTENTIAL . WHEN THE MEASURE OF OUR PROGRESS IS TAKEN AS A NATION , IT IS NOT HOW MANY PEOPLE BECAME THE RICHEST IN THE WORLD , IT IS HOW MANY COULD SHARE IN THE AMERICAN DREAM AND FEEL SECURE IN THEIR OWN LIVES AND IN THE LIVES OF THEIR CHILDREN . REVEREND YOUNGBLOOD WAS SAYING THAT MIKE FISHMAN WOULD HAVE INVITED DR . KING TO SPEAK TODAY AND HE WOULD HAVE COME , TOO . I REMEMBER HEARING HIM SPEAK WHEN I WENT WITH MY CHURCH INTO DOWNTOWN CHICAGO TO SEE AND HEAR FOR MYSELF SOMEONE WHO HAD BURST THROUGH THE STEREOTYPES AND THE CARICATURES , WHO COULD NOT BE HELD BACK BY BEING BEAT OR GASSED OR UNKNOWNWORD , WHOSE CAUSE WAS SO POWERFUL THAT HE WAS FINALLY SPEAKING NOT JUST TO THE WHOLE COUNTRY BUT TO THE ENTIRE WORLD . I SAT THERE AS A YOUNG GIRL UNKNOWNWORD AND TRANSFORMED BECAUSE THE SERMON HE GAVE THAT DAY WAS WILL WE STAY AWAKE THROUGH THE REVOLUTION . THE REVOLUTION COMES AND CHANGE IS MADE , AND THOSE OF US WHO BENEFIT , WE MOVE ON . BUT THIS IS A NEVER-ENDING REVOLUTION FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AND WE AT OUR PERIL THINK THAT THE WORK IS OVER BECAUSE WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEREVER THERE IS INJUSTICE IT IS AN UNKNOWNWORD TO US . I BELIEVE YOU HAVE TO LISTEN IN ORDER TO LEAD , I BELIEVE THAT AS THE SCRIPTURE SAYS , WE CANNOT JUST BE "HEARERS OF THE WORD ;" WE MUST BE "DOERS " OF THE WORD . I BELIEVE AS I WAS TAUGHT THAT UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD AND WORK WITHOUT FAITH IS JUST TOO HARD ." WE ARE CALLED UPON TODAY IN NEW YORK CITY TO FULFILL THE UNFINISHED DREAM AND TO LIVE THE LEGACY THAT WE HAVE INHERITED . EACH OF US , NO MATTER WHO WE ARE OR WHERE WE STARTED FROM , IS A BENEFICIARY OF DR . KING . WE ARE ALSO A BENEFICIARY OF LABOR LEADERS LIKE MIKE FISHMAN AND 32BJ , WHO NEVER GIVE UP ON THE DREAM OF EQUALITY AND JUSTICE . IT'S NOW UP TO US TO ANSWER THE URGENT QUESTION , WHETHER WE WILL CONTINUE THE WORK , WHETHER WE HAVE IT IN OURSELVES TO GO THE DISTANCE , WHETHER WE WILL STAND UP TO THE FORCES THAT DO NOT BELIEVE - DO NOT BELIEVE - IN THE FUNDAMENTAL VALUE THAT EACH OF US WAS ENDOWED BY OUR CREATOR WITH CERTAIN INALIENABLE RIGHTS AND THAT AS AMERICANS WE ARE ENTITLED TO THE JUSTICE WE WERE PROMISED . WILL WE DELIVER ON JOBS WITH LIVING WAGES ? WILL WE DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF HEALTH CARE FOR 47 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT IT AND THE MANY MORE WHO DON'T HAVE ENOUGH TO MEET THE NEEDS THEY HAVE ? WILL WE DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY WHICH IS A FUNDAMENTAL HUMAN RIGHT ? WILL WE DELIVER ON THE AMERICAN DREAM THAT CANNOT BE REALIZED IF WE TURN OUR BACKS ON LABOR AND THE STRUGGLES TO GIVE HARDWORKING PEOPLE THE RIGHTS THEY DESERVE TO HAVE ? IT WON'T BE EASY , BUT NOTHING WORTH DOING EVER IS . YOU ARE NOW PART THE GREAT FORWARD MOVEMENT OF PROGRESS IN AMERICA . YOU HEARD REVEREND YOUNGBLOOD TALK ABOUT HOW WE HAVE TRIED TO REALIZE A MORE PERFECT UNION . WE CAN POINT TO PROGRESS EVEN THOUGH THE JOURNEY IS NOT OVER . HOW MANY OF YOU EVER DREAMED YOU'D SEE THE DAY WHEN A WOMAN AND AN AFRICAN AMERICAN WERE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ? THAT SHOULD CAUSE OUR HEARTS TO UNKNOWNWORD WITH JOY AND CELEBRATION . I KNOW THAT WE HAVE TO BRING OUR PARTY TOGETHER AND COUNTRY TOGETHER . UNKNOWNWORD DOUGLASS , THE GREAT ABOLITIONIST WHO DID SOME OF HIS BEST WORK HERE IN NEW YORK , SPOKE OUT NOT ONLY FOR THE ABOLITION OF SLAVERY BUT FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS . HE SAID BACK IN 1848 , SUMMED UP ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HIS NEWSPAPER CALLED NORTH STAR , THAT RIGHT IS OF NO SEX AND TRUTH IS OF NO COLOR . GOD IS THE FATHER OF US ALL AND WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE A GREAT JOURNEY AHEAD OF US AS AMERICANS . WE NEED TO BRING TOGETHER OF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY , WHICH HAS BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , WOMEN'S RIGHTS MOVEMENT , AND THE HUMAN RIGHTS MOVEMENT . WE NEED TO BRING TOGETHER THE LABOR MOVEMENT , WHICH HAS BEEN THERE EVERY STEP OF THE WAY TO GET US TO WHERE WE ARE TODAY AND TO KEEP MOVING FORWARD FOR JUSTICE . WE MAY DIFFER ON MINOR MATTERS BUT WHEN IT COMES TO WHAT IS REALLY IMPORTANT , WE ARE FAMILY . WE ARE ALL UNKNOWNWORD TOGETHER TO ENSURE THAT THE LEAST , THE LAST AND THE LOST AMONG US BE GIVEN EVERY OPPORTUNITY TO BREAK THE CHAINS THAT STILL HOLD THEM BACK AND DOWN . THE SECURITY WORKERS ARE THE WORKERS WE FOCUS ON TODAY . THE ORGANIZING THAT IS HAPPENING WILL , I HOPE , RESULT SOON IN JUSTICE AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY . BUT THE STRUGGLE NEVER ENDS AND WE ALL HAVE TO REMAIN ON THE FRONT LINES OF THAT STRUGGLE . BOTH SENATOR OBAMA AND I KNOW THAT WE ARE WHERE WE ARE TODAY BECAUSE OF LEADERS LIKE DR . KING AND GENERATIONS OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE ALL OF YOU - PEOPLE WHO LOOKED INTO THE EYES OF THEIR CHILDREN AND SAW THE PROMISE OF A BETTER FUTURE , WHO PROTESTED AND PICKETED , WHO FACED DOGS AND TEAR GAS AND NIGHTSTICKS AGAINST THEIR SKULLS . SOME , LIKE DR . KING , EVEN GAVE THEIR LIVES . BUT THEY ALSO VOTED AND THEY BROUGHT PEOPLE TO THE POLLS AND THEY HELD LEADERS ACCOUNTABLE FOR DELIVERING ON THE PROMISE . IN HIS SPEECH TO THE SANITATION WORKERS IN MEMPHIS FORTY YEARS AGO , DR . KING URGED THEM TO UNKNOWNWORD ON IN THESE POWERFUL DAYS , THESE DAYS OF CHALLENGE TO MAKE AMERICA WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE ." IT WAS HIS VERY LAST SPEECH - HE WAS KILLED THE NEXT DAY . BUT LESS THAN A WEEK LATER , HIS BRAVE UNKNOWNWORD , CORETTA SCOTT KING , RETURNED TO MEMPHIS . SHE HAD NOT YET BURIED HER HUSBAND , BUT WAS DETERMINED TO FINISH HIS WORK AND WITH THREE OF HER CHILDREN AT HER SIDE , SHE LED A MARCH THROUGH THE STREETS OF MEMPHIS ; TENS OF THOUSANDS OF PEOPLE IN SOLIDARITY WITH THOSE STRIKING SANITATION WORKERS . EIGHT DAYS LATER , THEY GOT THEIR CONTRACT . TODAY , IT IS UP TO US TO CONTINUE THAT MARCH ; THAT MARCH FOR FREEDOM , JUSTICE , EQUALITY , OPPORTUNITY . IT IS UP TO US TO MAKE AMERICA WHAT IT OUGHT TO BE . IT IS UP TO US TO STAND UP FOR WORKERS HERE IN NEW YORK AND ACROSS THIS LAND . I KNOW THAT WORKING TOGETHER , RELYING ON THE FAITH AND LABOR COMMUNITIES , WE WILL FIND OUR WAY , WE WILL MEET OUR CHALLENGES , WE WILL FINALLY FULFILL THE PROMISE OF THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE AND WHEN WE DO , IT WILL BE BECAUSE OF SO MANY BRAVE PEOPLE LIKE ALL OF YOU . THANK YOU SO MUCH AND GOD BLESS YOU .
BLUE	THANK YOU , THANK YOU SO MUCH . I AM ABSOLUTELY THRILLED TO BE HERE . I SAY ALL THE TIME THAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE FUTURE SO THOUGHT I WOULD COME TO WHERE THE FUTURE IS ACTUALLY HAPPENING - RIGHT HERE . I WANT TO THANK MARVIN KROBKE FOR NOT ONLY WELCOMING US HERE BUT FOR GETTING ME A FEW MINUTES WITH THE PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE TRAINING TO CREATE THESE NEW JOBS OF THE FUTURE . I AM SO EXCITED THAT WHAT IS HAPPENING HERE CAN BE A MODEL FOR WHAT WE MUST DO AROUND AMERICA . THANK YOU SO MUCH , MARVIN . I WANT TO THANK MY FRIENDS WHO ARE HERE WITH ME . I APPRECIATE VERY MUCH THE STRONG STATEMENT OF ENDORSEMENT FROM JOHN UNKNOWNWORD . HE HAS BEEN A FRIEND , HE AND HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD SERVED NOT ONLY CALIFORNIA BUT AMERICA AND I'M GRATEFUL TO HIM . I WANT ALSO TO THANK THE SPEAKER - I'M AMAZED AT ALL THE WORK THAT IS BEING DONE IN A BIPARTISAN WAY HERE IN CALIFORNIA TO SET THE FUTURE IN UNKNOWNWORD ON THE ENVIRONMENT AND HEALTH CARE . UNKNOWNWORD NUZ , THANK YOU SO MUCH . I APPRECIATE SO MUCH MY FRIEND AND SISTER , YOUR CONGRESSWOMAN WHO HAS BEEN A STALWART CHAMPION OF ALL THOSE WHO SHE REPRESENTS AND SHE UNDERSTANDS THAT IT'S IMPERATIVE THAT WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR EVERYONE ; THAT WE TAKE CARE OF PEOPLE WHO GET UP EVERYDAY AND DO THE VERY BEST THEY CAN . SO LUCILLE , THANK YOU . THANK YOU FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP , CONGRESSWOMAN ROYBAL-ALLARD . AND I WAS SO GRATEFUL TO HAVE THE MAYOR'S HELP DURING TIMES IN THE COLD AND THE SNOW . EVERY TIME I SAW HIM HE WAS ON FIRE , WHICH HE NEEDED TO BE BECAUSE HE WAS SHIVERING HALF THE TIME . BUT HE GOT OUT THERE AND MADE THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY , WHICH IS REALLY A CASE FOR ALL OF US . AS THE MAYOR OF LOS ANGELES , HE NEEDS A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT WE ARE GOING TO WORK TOGETHER AND MAKE SURE THAT L'A . REMAINS A GREAT , GREAT CITY . SO I CAME HERE TODAY - HRC : THANK YOU , THANK YOU THANK YOU ! I CAME HERE TODAY TO CONTINUE TO TALK ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT . TO ME , RUNNING FOR OFFICE IS NOT ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO ARE RUNNING . NOW , THAT'S WHAT YOU SEE , DON'T YOU ? YOU SEE THAT ON TV , YOU SEE IT ON THE PAPERS , YOU SEE IT ON THE INTERNET , YOU HEAR IT ON THE RADIO . BUT ALWAYS REMEMBER THAT EVERY ELECTION IS ABOUT YOU . IT'S ABOUT YOUR FAMILIES , YOUR FUTURES . IT'S ABOUT YOUR JOBS , YOUR HEALTH CARE , YOUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION . IT IS ABOUT YOUR SONS AND DAUGHTERS WHO SERVE OUR COUNTRY FAR AWAY FROM HOME . IT IS ABOUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND I AM GOING TO GIVE THIS ELECTION BACK TO YOU HERE IN CALIFORNIA AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY . I HAVE ALWAYS , IN THIRTY-FIVE YEARS OF WORKING ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN , WOMEN , FAMILIES , WORKERS , I'VE ALWAYS LISTENED BECAUSE I THINK YOU CAN ACTUALLY LEARN A FEW THINGS IF YOU DO . TO HEAR THE VOICES THAT I HAVE HEARD DURING THIS CAMPAIGN MAKES ME BOTH HUMBLE AND MORE DETERMINED AND OPTIMISTIC ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER . I WAS IN LAS VEGAS YESTERDAY GOING DOOR TO DOOR AND I MET WONDERFUL , HARD-WORKING FAMILIES . I ALSO MET CONSTRUCTION WORKERS WHO HAD BEEN LAID OFF . I MET WORKERS WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE . I MET FAMILIES WHO ASKED ME HOW THEY WERE EVER GOING TO AFFORD TO PAY THEIR CHILDREN'S COLLEGE TUITION . I HEAR ALL OF THE VOICES OF AMERICA . ONE PARTICULAR QUESTION THAT I HEAR A LOT ABOUT TODAY IS WHAT IS HAPPENING WITH THE ECONOMY ? WHERE ARE WE ? THIS ECONOMY MAY BE WORKING FOR SOME PEOPLE , BUT IT SURE ISN'T WORKING FOR EVERYBODY . PART OF WHAT WE'VE GOT TO DECIDE IS WHETHER WE ARE JUST GOING TO ALLOW THIS ECONOMY TO UNKNOWNWORD INTO RECESSION . THE ECONOMISTS CAN ARGUE ABOUT IT - YOU CAN SEE THEM ON TV . SOME SAY , "YES , IT'S GOING THERE ." SOME SAY , "NOT YET ." SOME SAY , UNKNOWNWORD NO ." THE STATISTICS ARE ONE THING . THE STORIES ARE SOMETHING ALTOGETHER DIFFERENT . IF YOU'VE LOST YOUR JOB BECAUSE CONSTRUCTION HAS SLOWED DOWN , YOU DON'T CARE WHAT THE ECONOMISTS ARE TALKING ABOUT , DO YOU ? WHAT YOU CARE ABOUT IS WHO IS GOING TO HELP ME ? I GET UP EVERYDAY AND I TRY TO WORK AND THERE IS NOT WORK THERE . IF YOU'VE LOST YOUR HEALTH CARE BECAUSE THE INSURANCE COMPANY UNKNOWNWORD TO PAY FOR THE PROBLEM YOU AND YOUR FAMILY HAVE , OR THEY WON'T EVEN GIVE IT TO YOU IN THE FIRST PLACE OR YOUR EMPLOYER NO LONGER PROVIDES IT , IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT SOMEBODY IN WASHINGTON IS TALKING ABOUT . WHAT MATTERS IS WHAT YOU ARE GOING TO DO TO TAKE CARE OF YOURSELF AND YOUR FAMILY . IF YOU ARE LOOKING FOR A JOB AND EVERYWHERE YOU GO , YOU ARE TOLD THAT THOSE JOBS ARE NO LONGER PLENTIFUL IN CALIFORNIA OR AMERICA BECAUSE THEY'VE ALL BEEN SHIPPED OVER SEAS , IT DOESN'T MATTER WHAT YOU ARE TOLD , IT'S WHAT YOU FEEL . IT'S HOW YOU FEEL DEEP DOWN THAT MAYBE THE AMERICAN DREAM IS NOT GOING TO BE THERE FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILY . EVERY ONE OF US WHO WAS JUST ON THAT STAGE IS A PRODUCT OF THAT AMERICAN DREAM . EVERY ONE OF US WORKED OUR WAY INTO THE POSITIONS WE ARE , NOBODY HANDED US THE SILVER PLATTER . SOME OF US BROKE SOME BARRIERS TO GET THERE . WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WORKING HARD AND WE KNOW SOMETHING ABOUT WHAT IT MEANS TO REWARD THAT HARD WORK . THE WAY AMERICA HAS ALWAYS WORKED IS THAT IF YOU'RE WILING TO WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY , YOU WILL GET AHEAD . YOU WILL MAKE PROGRESS . YOUR CHILDREN WILL HAVE MORE AND BETTER OPPORTUNITIES THAN YOU HAVE HAD . YOU CAN LOOK BACK AT YOUR PARENTS AND YOUR GRANDPARENTS AND KNOW WHAT PRIDE THEY MUST FEEL BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESS THAT YOU AND AMERICA HAVE MADE TOGETHER . THAT IS WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT , BECAUSE I WANT TO MAKE SURE THE PURPOSE OF AMERICA , WHICH IS THAT PROGRESS AND THAT PRIDE CONTINUES FOR THAT LITTLE GIRL THERE AND EVERY OTHER SINGLE CHILD IN AMERICA . LONG BEFORE YOU HEARD FOLKS TALKING ABOUT MAYBE WE'RE SLIDING INTO A RECESSION , I SAW IT AND I FELT IT . I REPRESENT A LOT OF HARDWORKING PEOPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY IN NEW YORK . AND THEY BEGAN TO SAY , "WAIT A MINUTE , IT'S LIKE NOBODY EVEN SEES US ANY MORE ." WE HAVE A PRESIDENT , WE HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT JUST DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND WHAT'S GOING ON IN THE LIVES OF PEOPLE OF THIS COUNTRY . "IT'S ALMOST LIKE WE'RE INVISIBLE ," PEOPLE TOLD ME . THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP IN , THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I WANT TO BE THERE FOR OUR FUTURE . SO THERE WILL BE NO INVISIBLE AMERICANS WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU . FOR ME , POLITICS ISN'T A GAME , IT IS SERIOUS BUSINESS ABOUT OUR FUTURE . IT IS ABOUT HELPING EVERYONE GET THE TOOLS THEY NEED TO MAKE THE MOST OF THEIR OWN GOD GIVE POTENTIAL . IT'S ABOUT YOUR VOICES , YOUR DREAMS , YOUR FUTURE . AND SO WHEN I SEE A PROBLEM , I KNOW THAT AMERICA'S UP TO MEETING IT . IF WE HAVE LEADERS WHO UNDERSTAND WE HAVE TO PULL TOGETHER . WE'VE GOT TO BE UNITED , WE'VE GOT TO TRY TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER IN ORDER TO ADDRESS THE BIG CHALLENGES WE FACE IN AMERICA . THERE'S NOTHING AMERICA CAN'T DO IF WE MAKE UP OUR MINDS TO DO IT TOGETHER . THAT IS THE COMMON PURPOSE OF AMERICA AND THAT WILL BE THE PURPOSE OF MY PRESIDENCY : TO LISTEN TO YOU , TO BE YOUR VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE , AND TO DELIVER RESULTS FOR YOU AND YOUR FAMILIES , EVERY SINGLE DAY . SO HERE'S WHAT WE HAVE TO DECIDE . WE HAVE AN ECONOMY THAT DESPITE THE HAPPY TALK FROM THE WHITE HOUSE AND THE REPUBLICANS IS NOT WORKING FOR MOST AMERICANS . YOU KNOW THAT . THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY LOST A THOUSAND DOLLARS IN INCOME OVER THE LAST 7 YEARS . HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS HAVE DOUBLED . ENERGY COSTS HAVE GONE UP $2000 SINCE GEORGE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT . I KNOW SOMETIMES PEOPLE TRY TO ACT LIKE FACTS DON'T MATTER . YOU KNOW , FACTS KIND OF GET IN THE WAY OF FILLING RHETORIC OR POLITICAL COMBAT . FACTS ARE STUBBORN AND FACTS ACTUALLY REFLECT THE REALITY OF WHAT IS GOING ON IN PEOPLE'S LIVES . AND YOU THINK ABOUT ALL THE TALK FROM PRESIDENT BUSH ABOUT TAX CUTS , TAX CUTS , TAX CUTS . I'LL TELL YOU WHAT , IF YOU'RE WEALTHY AND WELL-CONNECTED , THAT TALK TURNS INTO ACTION . BUT IF YOU ARE A MIDDLE CLASS , WORKING FAMILY , WHATEVER TAX CUT YOU GOT FROM GEORGE BUSH , YOUR ENERGY COST WENT UP THREE TIMES MORE . SO WE'RE NOT GOING TO MAKE PROGRESS ON A LOT OF THESE TOUGH ISSUES UNTIL WE REALIZE THAT WE'VE GOT TO GET THE TWO OIL MEN OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND BEGIN TO CHANGE DIRECTION . NOW I HAVE LAID OUT A LONG TERM STRATEGY ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO STABILIZE AND GROW THE ECONOMY . I WANT TO GET BACK TO WHERE WE SEE MILLIONS OF NEW , GOOD JOBS CREATED IN AMERICA . I KNOW WE CAN DO THAT . BUT I DON'T THINK WE CAN WAIT UNTIL JANUARY 20TH OF NEXT YEAR . TOO MANY PEOPLE WILL BE HURT . TOO MANY JOBS WILL BE LOST . TOO MANY HOMES WILL BE FORECLOSED ON . TOO MANY MORE PEOPLE WILL GO WITHOUT HEALTH CARE . WE CANNOT WAIT . THAT IS WHY I AM CALLING ON THE PRESIDENT AND THE CONGRESS TO WORK TOGETHER TO COME UP WITH SOME QUICK ACTION TO BE ABLE TO PRESENT THE SLIDE TOWARD RECESSION . UNLIKE PRESIDENT BUSH'S 2001 PLAN WHICH FOCUSED ON TAX CUTS IN THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS , MY PLAN FOCUS ON MIDDLE CLASS AND HARDWORKING FAMILIES WHO DESERVE THE RELIEF AND NEED THE HELP RIGHT NOW . NOW HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO TOMORROW IF I COULD . FIRST , I'M PROPOSING A THIRTY BILLION DOLLAR FUND TO HELP HARD-HIT COMMUNITIES AND DISTRESSED HOME OWNERS WHETHER THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS . RIGHT HERE , RIGHT HERE IN CALIFORNIA , YOU HAVE 95,000 HOMES IN FORECLOSURE RIGHT NOW . YESTERDAY , NEVADA , NEVADA HAS THE HIGHEST RATE OF HOME FORECLOSURES IN AMERICA . I SAT DOWN AT A RESTAURANT IN VEGAS TALKING TO PEOPLE WHO HAVE ALREADY LOST THEIR HOMES . WHAT HAPPENS IN VEGAS WHEN IT COMES TO FORECLOSURE , CAN'T STAY IN VEGAS . WE'VE GOT TO TALK ABOUT IT ACROSS OUR COUNTRY . THIS FUND WOULD GIVE STATES AND COMMUNITIES , IT WOULD GIVE THE MAYOR , IT WOULD GIVE THE SPEAKER , IT WOULD GIVE THE LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR , IT WOULD GIVE YOU RESOURCES TO PROVIDE AT RISK FAMILIES WITH DESPERATELY NEED SERVICES LIKE FINANCIAL COUNSELING AND LEGAL ASSISTANCE AND HELP REFINANCING THESE UNWORKABLE , UNAFFORDABLE LOANS AND STATES AND COMMUNITIES COULD ALSO USE THESE FUNDS TO OFFSET THE COSTS ASSOCIATED WITH RISING FORECLOSURES . EVERYTHING FROM MAINTAINING VACANT PROPERTIES TO SERVICE LIKE COMMUNITY POLICING . BECAUSE SOMETIMES PEOPLE HAVE TALKED ABOUT HIS MORTGAGE CRISIS IN A VERY NARROW WAY . CERTAIN PEOPLE ARE AT RISK OF LOSING THEIR HOMES OR ALREADY HAVE WITHOUT SEEING THE BROAD IMPLICATION OF THIS . IF YOU HAVE HOME FORECLOSURES IN A NEIGHBORHOOD , YOU ARE LIKELY IN THIS HOUSING MARKET , TO HAVE VACANT PROPERTIES . WHEN YOU HAVE VACANT PROPERTIES YOU ATTRACT PEOPLE THAT YOU DON'T WANT TO BE NEAR YOUR KIDS . YOU BEGIN TO HAVE LOWER PROPERTIES TAX REVENUES SO SERVICES GET CUT BACK WHICH MAKES THE PROBLEM EVEN WORSE . I WANT US TO START UNDERSTANDING THAT ON EVERY PROBLEM WE FACE IN AMERICA , WE'RE IN IT TOGETHER . IT'S NOT US VERSUS THEM , IT IS ALL OF US TOGETHER , WE HAVE TO COME UP WITH SOLUTIONS AND I BELIEVE WE CAN START BY FOCUSING ON THEM . SECOND , I'M CALLING FOR COMPREHENSIVE ACTION TO END THE HOUSING CRISIS AND KEEP IT FROM DRAGGING DOWN THE ENTIRE ECONOMY . HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO : NUMBER ONE , I'M CALLING FOR A 90-DAY MORATORIUM ON FORECLOSURES . NO FORECLOSURES FOR THREE MONTHS . SO IF THE BANK IS ABOUT TO FORECLOSE ON YOUR HOME , YOU'LL HAVE SOME BREATHING ROOM TO TRY TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO RESTRUCTURE YOUR MORTGAGE . BECAUSE HERE'S WHAT'S HAPPENING , STARTING LAST MARCH I SAID , WE'VE HAD PREDATORY LENDING PRACTICES , WE'VE HAD PEOPLE WHO PUT HOMEOWNERS INTO MORTGAGES THEY COULDN'T AFFORD BECAUSE THEY GOT MORE MONEY FOR HAVING A HIGHER INTEREST RATE MORTGAGE , WE HAVE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COULD PAY A GOOD INTEREST RATE ON A MORTGAGE WHO WERE PUSHED INTO THE AJUDSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES AND ONCE THEY GO UP , THEY'RE BEYOND SOMEBODY'S . ABILITY TO PAY FOR IT . WE HAVE A LOT OF FAMILIES WHO RIGHT NOW COULD STAY IN THEIR HOMES AND PAY THE MORTGAGE THEY'RE PAYING BUT A LOT OF PRESSURE IS COMING FROM THE INVESTORS WHO BOUGHT ALL OF THESE MORTGAGES . BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND IT'S NOT YOUR LOCAL BANK , ITS NOT THE FELLOW WHO SOLD IT TO YOU WHO'S NOW HOLDING THE MORTGAGE , IT'S SOMEBODY SITTING IN SHANGHAI OR IN UNKNOWNWORD OR BERLIN OR IN LONDON OR SOMEWHERE ELSE IN THE WORLD AND WHAT THEY'RE SAYING IS "OK I'M SUPPOSED TO GET AN INTEREST RATE RETURN UP HERE AND IF YOU STOP ME FROM GETTING THAT THEN I'M NOT GETTING THE RETURN ON MY INVESTMENT ." THAT'S WHY LAST MONTH I WENT TO WALL STREET , I REPRESENT WALL STREET AND I'M PROUD TO DO THAT BECAUSE THERE ARE A LOT OF THINGS THAT COME OUT OF THERE THAT RAISE WEALTH AND GIVE PEOPLE OPPORTUNITY BUT ON THIS ISSUE WALL STREET IS UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE BANKS AND THE MORTGAGE BROKERS AND THE LENDERS AND EVERYBODY WHO TOOK ADVANTAGE OF AMERICANS IN THIS MORTGAGE CRISIS . SO IF WE CAN GET A MORATORIUM THEN WE CAN GET PEOPLE TO COME IN AND SAY LOOK WHY WOULD YOU TAKE SOMEBODY'S HOME AWAY BECAUSE THEN YOU'VE GOT A VACANT PROPERTY YOU'RE PROBABLY NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO SELL - THEY'RE PAYING UNKNOWNWORD NOW YOU WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD IT UP TO $1,500 YOU KNOW THEY CAN'T PAY THAT . DO YOU WANT SOME KIND OF RETURN ON YOUR INVESTMENT OR YOU WANT A FORECLOSURE WITH NOTHING AHEAD ? THEN I WANT TO SAY , LOOK , WE HAVE TO FREEZE INTEREST RATES FOR FIVE YEARS . LET'S JUST SAY WE'RE NOT GOING TO RAISE THE INTEREST RATES ON OUR MORTGAGES . WE WANT TO CONVERT THESE UNAFFORDABLE MORTGAGES INTO LOANS THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD . SO IF YOU HAVE AN ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGE THAT IS ABOUT TO SKYROCKET , YOU'LL HAVE THE CHANCE TO STAY IN YOUR HOME AND PAY AFFORDABLE PAYMENTS . NOW WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO END THE ABUSIVE PRACTICES THAT GOT US TO WHERE WE ARE . AND LET ME JUST MENTION ONE BECAUSE IT IS THE ONE THAT I GET THE MOST UPSET ABOUT AND I HEARD ABOUT IT YESTERDAY TALKING TO HOMEOWNERS IN NEVADA . A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS OR WHO MOVED FROM A VERY SMALL HOME WITH A GROWING FAMILY TO A LARGER ONE , SIGNED THESE MORTGAGE PAPERS - I GOT TO TELL YOU , I SKIMMED MY MORTGAGE PAPERS , I DIDN'T READ THEM . I DIDN'T KNOW WHAT WAS ALL THAT FINE PRINT AND THOSE PAGES AND PAGES OF LEGALESE AND MOST PEOPLE WHO SIGNED ON THE UNKNOWNWORD LINE RELIED ON WHAT THEY WERE TOLD . A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WERE THESE FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS , THEY WANTED TO DO THE RIGHT THING . THEY TALKED TO THEIR FRIENDS AND THEIR FAMILIES , PEOPLE SAID , "YOU'VE GOT A HOUSE NOW , IF YOU CAN PAY IT OFF YOU'LL OWN IT FREE AND CLEAR SOONER ." IN ADDITION TO THE INTEREST PAYMENT PEOPLE STARTED PUTTING A LITTLE BIT MORE IN THE CHECK , BECAUSE THEY THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING . WHAT THEY DID NOT KNOW IS THAT THERE IS A PROVISION IN A LOT OF THESE MORTGAGES FOR PREPAYMENT PENALTIES . IN OTHER WORDS , YOU TRIED TO DO THE RIGHT THING IN YOUR MIND AND YOU GOT HAMMERED WITH AN AUTOMATIC INCREASE IN INTEREST RATES BECAUSE THE INVESTORS DIDN'T WANT YOU TO PAY IT OFF ANY SOONER , THEY WANTED TO PENALIZE YOU FROM TRYING . THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE OUT THERE WHO ARE BEING PUNISHED FOR DOING WHAT WE WOULD HAVE THOUGHT WAS THE RIGHT THING . NOW , NEXT , WE'VE GOT TO INVEST IN EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR FAMILIES WITH SKYROCKETING HEATING BILLS THIS WINTER . TODAY , NEARLY 40 MILLION FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA ARE ELIGIBLE FOR THIS ASSISTANCE - BUT ONLY ABOUT 16 % RECEIVE IT . A LOT OF PARENTS AND THE MAYOR AND I MET A LOT OF PEOPLE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE AND IN IOWA IN THE SNOW , IN THE BELOW ZERO UNKNOWNWORD FACTOR , WHO WERE SAYING US "HOW AM I GOING TO AFFORD TO PAY MY UTILITY BILLS , I CAN'T GO WITHOUT THE HEAT HOW AM I GOING TO AFFORD TO PAY IT ? WELL MAYBE I WON'T TAKE MY PRESCRIPTION DRUGS . MAYBE I'LL POSTPONE THE MORTGAGE PAYMENT AND HOPE THAT I CAN CATCH UP WITH IT LATER ." SO WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO GET THAT ASSISTANCE DIRECTLY TO PEOPLE . AND THAT'S WHY I WOULD PROVIDE AN ADDITIONAL $25 BILLION IN EMERGENCY ASSISTANCE - ENOUGH TO COVER EVERY SINGLE PERSON WHO NEEDS IT SO WE CAN DO THE RIGHT THING . FOURTH , I WOULD EXTEND AND EXPAND UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE , INCLUDING DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF WEEKS PEOPLE ARE ELIGIBLE FOR ASSISTANCE . BECAUSE IF YOU'RE OUT OF WORK AND YOU'RE STRUGGLING TO FIND A JOB , YOU DESERVE A LITTLE EXTRA HELP BECAUSE IF THE ECONOMY IS SLIDING INTO RECESSION , THERE MIGHT NOT BE A JOB THERE FOR YOU SO WHAT ARE YOU AND YOUR FAMILY SUPPOSED TO LIVE ON AND BESIDES IF YOU GET THAT MONEY IN YOUR POCKET YOU'LL SPEND IT AND THAT WILL GIVE THE ECONOMY AN IMMEDIATE BOOST WHICH WILL HELP US FROM GOING DEEPER INTO ECONOMIC TROUBLES FINALLY , I TOLD YOU WHAT I WOULD DO TO TRY TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS . HERE'S WHAT I WOULD DO TO SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY . IT HAS EVERYTHING TO DO WITH WHAT THE IBEW IS DOING ALONG WITH NECA BECAUSE THIS IS EXACTLY WHERE I WOULD PUT MONEY . I WOULD TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO JUMP-START "GREEN COLLAR " JOB GROWTH ALL ACROSS AMERICA . SOMETIMES WHEN I TALK ABOUT THIS I GET BLANK STARES TO BE HONEST . I REALLY DO BECAUSE PEOPLE CAN'T KNOW IT IF THEY HAVEN'T SEEN IT . THEY KNOW ABOUT WHITE COLLAR JOBS THEY KNOW ABOUT BLUE COLLAR JOBS BUT THE IDEA OF GREEN COLLAR JOBS IS SOMETHING THAT FOLKS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO APPRECIATE . I TEAMED UP WITH ONE OF MY FELLOW SENATORS A FEW MONTHS AGO AND WE PASSED LEGISLATION TO PUT FEDERAL DOLLARS INTO TRAINING PEOPLE FOR GREEN COLLAR JOBS WHAT I WANT TO DO IS ACCELERATE THAT MONEY TO COME TO PLACES LIKE HERE TO TRAIN MORE PEOPLE . THESE RENEWABLE ENERGY JOBS ARE HIGH WAGE JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED . THIS IS WHAT WE OUGHT TO BE INVESTING IN WITH FEDERAL DOLLARS RIGHT NOW . NUMBER ONE , I WOULD IMMEDIATELY IMPLEMENT A GREEN BUILDING FUND TO REBUILD AND RENOVATE PUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE SCHOOLS , LIKE MUNICIPAL BUILDINGS , LIKE LAW ENFORCEMENT BUILDINGS , TO MAKE THEM MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT . WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS AND I WOULD DO IT IMMEDIATELY . I WOULD ISSUE AN EXECUTIVE ORDER SAYING THERE WILL NOT BE ANY NEW FEDERAL BUILDINGS BUILT OR ANY ONE OF THE 500,000 THAT WE HAVE NOW RENOVATED UNLESS THEY BECOME ENERGY EFFICIENT AND MOVE TOWARD CARBON UNKNOWNWORD . THIS WOULD CREATE TENS OF THOUSANDS , EVENTUALLY HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS . PEOPLE WOULD BE PUT TO WORK INSTALLING THOSE SOLAR PANELS ON DISPLAY HERE AND OTHER COUNTRIES ARE HEAD OF US . BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN ANYTHING BECAUSE WE CAN CATCH UP IN A HURRY IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT . BUT YOU'VE GOT TO KNOW . TAKE GERMANY ; GERMANY DECIDED TO INVEST DOLLARS IN NEW ENERGY PARTICULARLY SOLAR . LAST TIME I LOOKED , I DON'T THINK THE CLIMATE IN GERMANY IS AS GOOD AS IT IS HERE IN CALIFORNIA BUT THEY HAVE PUT NEARLY 300,000 PEOPLE TO WORK IN A MUCH SMALLER ECONOMY INSTALLING SOLAR PANELS , MAKING THE DISPLAYS , DOING WHAT IS NECESSARY TO ACTUALLY MOVE PRACTICALLY AND QUICKLY TOWARD RENEWABLE ENERGY . I WOULD ALSO PURSUE A CRASH WEATHERIZATION PLAN TO HELP PEOPLE INSULATE THEIR HOMES YOU CAN SAVE UP TO 20 % ON YOUR ENERGY BILLS IF YOU START TODAY . AND THAT IS OBVIOUSLY HEATING IN THE COLD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE HOT . YOU CAN SAVE 20 % BUT A LOT OF PEOPLE DON'T KNOW HOW TO DO THAT , THEY DON'T UNDERSTAND IT . AGAIN HERE ARE JOBS GOING INTO INSULATE HOMES , MAKING SURE THAT YOU HAVE THICKER GLASS , LOOKING FOR WAYS TO DELIVER ON THAT 20 % SAVINGS . I WOULD BEGIN TO ASK THE UTILITIES TO IN UNKNOWNWORD IN CONSERVATION . IT IS IN THEIR LONG-TERM INTEREST BUT MORE IMPORTANTLY IT IS IN AMERICA'S LONG-TERM INTEREST THAT WE START SAVING ON ENERGY . HERE I HAVE TO APPLAUD CALIFORNIA BECAUSE BACK IN THE 1970'S , WHICH SOME OF US CAN REMEMBER , A LOT OF US WAITED IN LINE FOR GAS FOR A LONG TIME . RIGHT , MARVIN , RIGHT ? I REMEMBER GETTING MY LITTLE , CRUMMY CAR IN LINE AT UNKNOWNWORD A'M ., SPENDING AN HOUR OR TWO HAVING SOMEBODY FROM THE GAS STATION WALK DOWN THE CARS AND SAY , "WE'VE RUN OUT OF GAS , WHY DON'T YOU TRY THE STATION DOWN THE ROAD ?" WHEN THAT HAPPENED IT SHOULD HAVE BEEN THE BIGGEST WAKE-UP CALL IN AMERICAN HISTORY . WE SAW SOME CHANGES ; I GIVE CREDIT TO PRESIDENT JIMMY CARTER . HE SAID , "WE'VE GOT TO DO BETTER . WE'VE GOT TO CONSERVE MORE ; WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT ." YOU KNOW WHAT HAPPENED . THE PRICE OF OIL FELL AND SO EVERYBODY SAID , "THANK GOODNESS WE DON'T HAVE TO DO ANY OF THAT UNKNOWNWORD ." AND WE GOT LULLED INTO A FALSE SENSE OF SECURITY . BUT NOT CALIFORNIA ; CALIFORNIA TOOK A HARD LOOK AT GAS MILEAGE AND BEGAN TO MAKE SOME CHANGES , TOOK A HARD LOOK AT ELECTRICITY UNKNOWNWORD AND TODAY , ON AVERAGE , A CALIFORNIAN USES 50 % LESS ELECTRICITY THAN ANYBODY ANYWHERE ELSE IN AMERICA . CALIFORNIA HAS LED THE WAY , MADE A DIFFERENCE . AND I AM STRONGLY SUPPORTIVE OF WHAT THE STATE IS TRYING TO DO TO BEGIN TO REGULATE TAILPIPE EMISSIONS . IT'S BEEN A BIG FIGHT WITH THE EPA AND THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION BUT CALIFORNIA CAN BE THE LEADER AGAIN . I WOULD ALSO DO MORE TO OFFER TAX CREDITS SOONER RATHER THAN LATER FOR CONSUMERS WHO MAKE ENERGY EFFICIENT PURCHASES - FROM UNKNOWNWORD YOUR APPLIANCES , TO BUYING HYBRID VEHICLES , TO INSTALLING NEW WINDOWS IN YOUR HOME . WE ALL KNOW THAT THIS IS NOT ONLY THE RIGHT THING TO DO , THIS IS SMART . IT'LL SAVE YOU MONEY . I JUST RECENTLY WAS BRIEFED ABOUT A NEW PLUG-IN ELECTRIC CAR THAT UNKNOWNWORD ON A NEW UNKNOWNWORD BY AN AMERICAN CAR MAKER - BECAUSE THAT'S MY GOAL ; TO HAVE THESE CARS MADE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA . AND AFTER TEST DRIVING IT FOR SIX MONTHS , THEY GOT 15,000 MILES ON TEN GALLONS OF GAS . BECAUSE THINK ABOUT THIS : IF HENRY FORD WERE TO COME BACK TODAY AND GO OUT IN THE PARKING LOT HERE AND ASK A COUPLE OF THE IBEW MEMBERS TO LET HIM LOOK AT YOUR CAR , HE'D BE AMAZED AT THE SIZE AND THE POWER , HE'D BE AMAZED AT THE GPS - THE FACT THAT SOMEBODY WOULD TALK TO YOU AND TELL YOU WHERE TO GO , THAT WOULD BE ASTONISHING , THAT'S SCIENCE FICTION - AND THEN HE WOULD LIFT UP THE HOOD , AND WHAT WOULD HE SEE ? THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE . IT REALLY HASN'T CHANGED THAT MUCH SINCE THE MODEL T . WE NEED TO HAVE A STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND THAT IS LOOKING AT HOW WE HAVE NEW TECHNOLOGY LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING RIGHT HERE , WITH EVERYTHING FROM OUR VEHICLES TO OUR HOMES TO OUR BUSINESSES TO OUR UTILITIES AND MAKE IT A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN . IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO WORSEN , IF ALL OF WHAT I JUST PROPOSED WERE PUT INTO PLACE AS AN IMMEDIATE JUMPSTART TO GET ECONOMIC ACTION GOING , TO GET CONSUMERS SPENDING AGAIN , THEN I THINK WE SHOULD LOOK AT PROVIDING AN ADDITIONAL $40 BILLION IN TAX REBATES TO WORKING AND MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES - NOT TO THE WEALTHY , THEY HAVE MORE THAN GOTTEN THEIR SHARE OF OUR TAX DOLLARS . THIS RELIEF WOULD FOLLOW THE SAME PRINCIPLES AS THE OTHER INITIATIVES I'VE OUTLINED TODAY . IT WOULD PROVIDE IMMEDIATE , SHORT-TERM HELP , TARGETED TO THOSE IN MOST IN NEED AND IT WOULD BE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE . NOW , WILL THIS BE EASY ? NO , IT ISN'T EASY , BUT I THINK IF IT WERE EASY SOME OTHER COUNTRY WOULD DO IT . WE'RE THE PEOPLE WHO ARE SUPPOSED TO DO WHAT IS HARD . WE'RE THE INNOVATION NATION . WE'RE THE FOLKS WHO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND GET TO WORK TOGETHER . YEARS FROM NOW I HOPE THAT OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN WILL LOOK BACK AT THIS ELECTION AND SAY , "WOW , THANK GOODNESS . THIS IS WHEN AMERICA CAME BACK AND WE CAME BACK STRONG ." RIGHT NOW WE'RE IN A BIG HOLE ; WE'VE GOT TO DIG OURSELVES OUT . I WANT TO PASS OUT SHOVELS TO EVERYBODY , BECAUSE I DON'T THINK IT'S IN AMERICA'S INTEREST TO BORROW MONEY FROM THE CHINESE TO BUY OIL FROM THE SAUDIS . I AM GOING TO DO EVERYTHING I CAN TO MAKE SURE THAT WE SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS . ELECTIONS ARE NOT JUST ABOUT SPEECHES , THEY'RE NOT JUST ABOUT ALL THE CAMERAS SHOWING UP . THEY ARE ABOUT WHAT HAPPENS WHEN A LEADER HAS TO FINALLY MAKE SOME TOUGH DECISIONS . WE'VE GOT CHALLENGES AROUND THE WORLD - ENDING THE WAR AND DEALING WITH ALL OF THE PROBLEMS WE ARE GOING TO INHERIT FROM PRESIDENT BUSH . WE HAVE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES , HEALTH CARE CHALLENGES HERE AT HOME . I AM LISTENING . I HAVE ALWAYS LISTENED . I WANT TO BE YOUR VOICE IN THE WHITE HOUSE . THAT IS AMERICA'S COMMON PURPOSE . LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU . THANK YOU SO MUCH . I COME TONIGHT WITH A VERY , VERY FULL HEART . AND I WANT ESPECIALLY TO THANK NEW HAMPSHIRE . OVER THE LAST WEEK , I LISTENED TO YOU AND IN THE PROCESS , I FOUND MY OWN VOICE . I FELT LIKE WE ALL SPOKE FROM OUR HEARTS , AND I AM SO GRATIFIED THAT YOU RESPONDED . NOW , TOGETHER , LET'S GIVE AMERICA THE KIND OF COMEBACK THAT NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS JUST GIVEN ME . FOR ALL THE UPS AND DOWNS OF THIS CAMPAIGN , YOU HELPED REMIND EVERYONE THAT POLITICS ISN'T A GAME . THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT PEOPLE . IT'S ABOUT MAKING A DIFFERENCE IN YOUR LIVES . IT'S ABOUT MAKING SURE THAT EVERYONE IN THIS COUNTRY HAS THE OPPORTUNITY TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . THAT HAS BEEN THE WORK OF MY LIFE . WE ARE FACING A MOMENT OF SO MANY BIG CHALLENGES . WE KNOW WE FACE CHALLENGES HERE AT HOME , AROUND THE WORLD , SO MANY CHALLENGES FOR THE PEOPLE WHOSE LIVES I'VE BEEN PRIVILEGED TO BE PART OF . I'VE MET FAMILIES IN THIS STATE AND ALL OVER OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE LOST THEIR HOMES TO FORECLOSURES . MEN AND WOMEN WHO WORK DAY AND NIGHT BUT CAN'T PAY THE BILLS AND HOPE THEY DON'T GET SICK BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE . YOUNG PEOPLE WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO GO TO COLLEGE TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS . TOO MANY HAVE BEEN INVISIBLE FOR TOO LONG . WELL , YOU ARE NOT INVISIBLE TO ME . THE OIL COMPANIES , THE DRUG COMPANIES , THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES , THE PREDATORY STUDENT LOAN COMPANIES HAVE HAD SEVEN YEARS OF A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR THEM . IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR ALL OF YOU . I INTEND TO BE THAT PRESIDENT , TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO PUTS YOU FIRST - YOUR LIVES , YOUR FAMILIES , YOUR CHILDREN , YOUR FUTURE . I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN AMERICA , IN OUR CAN-DO SPIRIT , IN OUR ABILITY TO MEET ANY CHALLENGE AND SOLVE ANY PROBLEM . I BELIEVE IN WHAT WE CAN DO TOGETHER . IN THE FUTURE , WE WILL BUILD TOGETHER . THERE WILL BE NO MORE INVISIBLE AMERICANS . SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE WHAT WE'VE LEARNED HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , AND WE'RE GOING TO RALLY ON AND MAKE OUR CASE . WE ARE IN IT FOR THE LONG RUN . AND THAT IS BECAUSE WE ARE IN IT FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THIS VICTORY WILL SERVE NOTICE THAT PEOPLE ACROSS OUR COUNTRY KNOW WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE , THAT WE WILL ALL BE CALLED UPON TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE OF AMERICA . WE'LL BE CALLED UPON TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS WILL GROW AND PROSPER AGAIN , TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THE GOVERNMENT WILL BE OF THE PEOPLE , BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE , NOT JUST THE PRIVILEGED FEW , TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THAT EVERY GENERATION WILL HAVE THEIR SHOT AT THE AMERICAN DREAM , TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE THAT WE'LL HAVE THE WILL AND THE WISDOM TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ THE RIGHT WAY , TO DELIVER ON THE PROMISE TO TAKE CARE OF OUR BRAVE VETERANS AND RESTORE AMERICA'S STANDING , RESPECT , AND CREDIBILITY AROUND THE WORLD . WE KNOW THAT FOR THE PROMISE OF AMERICA TO BE REAL , WE ARE CALLED UPON TO DELIVER ON THAT PROMISE . AND IF YOU JOIN IN THIS CALL TO GREATNESS , WE WILL , TOGETHER , ANSWER . SO TOMORROW , WE'RE GOING TO GET UP , ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND KEEP GOING . I INVITE YOU TO COME JOIN US AT HILLARYCLINTON'COM . WE'RE GOING TO TAP INTO ALL OF THE SPIRIT , THE TALENT AND JUST THE PLAIN GRIT OF THIS GREAT NATION AGAIN . WE ARE DETERMINED TO TACKLE OUR TOUGHEST PROBLEMS AND STAND UP TO THOSE WHO MOST NEED A CHAMPION BECAUSE WE ARE DETERMINED TO MAKE AMERICA WORK AGAIN FOR ALL OF OUR PEOPLE . WE CAME BACK TONIGHT BECAUSE YOU SPOKE LOUDLY AND UNKNOWNWORD . YOU WANT THIS CAMPAIGN TO BE ABOUT YOU BECAUSE THERE IS SO MUCH AT STAKE FOR OUR COUNTRY . I HAVE SO MANY PEOPLE TO THANK . I WANT TO THANK THE TWO MOST IMPORTANT PEOPLE IN MY LIFE , BILL AND CHELSEA . I WANT TO THANK THEM FOR THEIR INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT , THEIR PASSION AND THEIR HEART . I WANT TO THANK MY ENTIRE FAMILY , PARTICULARLY MY MOTHER , WHO IS WATCHING TONIGHT . I WANT TO THANK THE EXTRAORDINARY TEAM HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE THAT NEVER FALTERED ONE MINUTE . THAT TEAM HAD A GREAT STAFF . IT HAD VOLUNTEERS AND SUPPORTERS FROM ACROSS THE STATE AND THIS COUNTRY . I WANT TO THANK THE YOUNG PEOPLE ACROSS NEW HAMPSHIRE WHO CAME OUT . THEY ASKED THE HARD QUESTIONS AND THEY VOTED THEIR HEARTS AND THEIR MINDS AND I REALLY APPRECIATE IT . FINALLY , I WANT TO SAY HOW MUCH I RESPECT OUR DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATES . SENATORS DODD AND BIDEN WHO WERE IN THE RACE EARLIER HAVE GIVEN GREAT SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY . GOVERNOR RICHARDSON , CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH , SENATOR EDWARDS AND SENATOR OBAMA . THEY ALL HAVE PUT THEMSELVES ON THE LINE DAY AND NIGHT ON BEHALF OF THIS COUNTRY WE LOVE SO MUCH . THIS CAMPAIGN WILL TRANSFORM AMERICA BECAUSE WE WILL TAKE ON THE CHALLENGES . WE WILL SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES . EVERY SINGLE DAY , I AM NOT GOING OUT THERE ON MY OWN . I AM GOING OUT THERE UNKNOWNWORD BY MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE , AS I DO , THAT THIS COUNTRY IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR . THANK YOU , AND GOD BLESS YOU !
BLUE	THANK YOU , NEW HAMPSHIRE . THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH . NEW HAMPSHIRE , HOW ARE YOU TONIGHT ? ARE YOU READY TO PICK A PRESIDENT ? ARE YOU READY FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE MAN , WOMAN AND CHILD ? ARE YOU READY FOR AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS AGAIN FOR EVERY AMERICAN , NOT JUST THE FEW AND THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED ? ARE YOU READY TO STOP THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRING OUR TROOPS HOME AND TO TAKE CARE OF THEM WHEN THEY COME HOME ? WELL , IF YOU ARE READY , THEN WE HAVE TO PICK A PRESIDENT STARTING THIS TUESDAY WHO IS COMMITTED TO MAKING THE CHANGES THAT AMERICA DESERVES . IT IS TIME FOR US , AS DEMOCRATS , TO MAKE OUR VOICES HEARD ACROSS OUR COUNTRY THAT WE KNOW OUR COUNTRY CAN DO BETTER AND WE WANT TO BE PART OF THE CHANGE THAT IS WAITING TO HAPPEN . I AM SO HAPPY TO BE HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , A PLACE THAT I HAVE COME NOW FOR OVER 16 YEARS . I HAVE LEARNED A LOT IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . I HAVE LEARNED THE IMPORTANCE THAT YOU PLACE ON ELECTIONS BECAUSE YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IT IS NOT ABOUT THOSE OF US WHO ARE RUNNING . IT IS ABOUT YOU . IT IS ABOUT ALL OF THOSE WHO NEED A CHAMPION . YEARS AGO I WROTE A BOOK CALLED , "IT TAKES A VILLAGE ." THERE ARE A LOT OF BEAUTIFUL VILLAGES IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . IN IT I HAD A CHAPTER TITLED , .EVERY CHILD NEEDS A CHAMPION .. IT IS TIME FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO HAVE A CHAMPION FOR A PRESIDENT AGAIN WHO LOOKS AFTER US , TAKES CARE OF BUSINESS HERE AT HOME . I KNOW THAT EVERYBODY WANTS CHANGE . SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU MAKE CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT . SOME PEOPLE THINK YOU MAKE CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT . I THINK YOU MAKE CHANGE BY WORKING REALLY , REALLY HARD AND BRINGING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO CREATE THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED . THAT IS WHAT I HAVE BEEN DOING FOR MORE THAN 35 YEARS . I INTEND TO TAKE ALL OF THAT EXPERIENCE MAKING POSITIVE CHANGE AND PUT IT TO WORK FOR YOU . AMERICA NEEDS A NEW BEGINNING . WE NEED TO ONCE AGAIN BELIEVE IN OURSELVES , HAVE PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY , MAKE PROGRESS TOGETHER . I KNOW THAT WE ARE UP TO THE JOB . THERE ARE MANY REASONS WHY HISTORY WILL JUDGE GEORGE BUSH HARSHLY . AMONG THE TWO ARE THE WAY THAT HE HAS USED FEAR TO DIVIDE US . HE HAS GOVERNED BY IT AND HE HAS UNDERMINED THAT SENSE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND PROGRESS THAT HAS BEEN AT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM . AND THE OTHER REASON IS BECAUSE WE HAVE BEEN INFECTED BY A SENSE OF FATALISM . WE CAN'T SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS LIKE FIXING THE ECONOMY AND HEALTH CARE . INSTEAD , WE'RE TOLD THAT WE SHOULD NOT EVEN TRY . SINCE WHEN DID AMERICA BECOME THE CAN'T DO NATION ? I DO NOT BELIEVE THAT IS WHO WE ARE . I KNOW THAT IS NOT WHO NEW HAMPSHIRE IS . TOGETHER , WE ARE GOING TO TAKE BACK OUR BIRTHRIGHT . WE ARE GOING TO HAVE THE CONFIDENCE AND OPTIMISM TO START ROLLING UP OUR SLEEVES AND SOLVING OUR PROBLEMS AGAIN . THAT WILL BEGIN WITH ONCE AGAIN RESTORING AND REBUILDING THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS . IT DESERVES A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FINALLY DELIVER ON HEALTH CARE , SOMETHING I HAVE COMMITTED MYSELF TO FOR MANY YEARS NOW . WHY ? BECAUSE I CANNOT BEAR THAT THERE 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS AND MILLIONS MORE WHO ARE DENIED HEALTH COVERAGE EVEN THOUGH THEY HAVE INSURANCE . I HAVE PROPOSED A PLAN I THINK IS NOT ONLY GOING TO GET THE JOB DONE TO COVER EVERY AMERICAN , BUT IS POLITICALLY DOABLE . IT WILL BRING TOGETHER BUSINESS , LABOR , DOCTORS , NURSES , HOSPITALS . WE WILL OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL HEALTH PLAN . CONGRESS HAS A GOOD PLAN FOR ITSELF . IT IS TIME THAT EVERYBODY HAD THE SAME HEALTH CARE THAT CONGRESS PROVIDES FOR ITSELF AND FEDERAL EMPLOYEES . WE NEED TO BE SURE THIS IS COMPREHENSIVE HEALTH CARE . WE WILL COVER MENTAL HEALTH AND END THE STIGMA THAT IS TOO OFTEN STILL ASSOCIATED WITH MENTAL HEALTH TREATMENT . THERE ARE SOME WHO SAY WE CAN'T COVER EVERYONE . IT'S TOO POLITICALLY AMBITIOUS . IT'S CONTROVERSIAL . THEY OFFER INSTEAD VIRTUAL HEALTH CARE . I BELIEVE WE HAVE TO COVER EVERYONE AND I AM NOT GOING TO LEAVE ANYONE OUT . I WOULD NOT KNOW WHO TO LEAVE OUT . WOULD I LEAVE OUT THE WOMAN WHOSE SON HAS HAD FOUR HEART UNKNOWNWORD ALREADY , AND FACING SO MANY MORE YEARS OF POOR HEALTH AND CHALLENGE ? WOULD I LEAVE OUT THE YOUNG COUPLE FROM MANCHESTER WHO HAVE THEIR OWN BUSINESS WHO I MET DOOR KNOCKING AND ARE WONDERING IF THEY WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR CHILDREN . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS , STARTING WITH HEALTH CARE . WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO THE ECONOMY . WE ARE IN TROUBLED WATERS IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY . TODAY , IT WAS ANNOUNCED THAT WE'VE HAD THE WORST THREE DAYS TO START ANY YEAR SINCE UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAD AN UNEMPLOYMENT FIGURE WHICH CONFIRMED OUR FEARS THAT UNEMPLOYMENT IS RISING . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL EXERCISE THE KIND OF ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP THAT AMERICANS DESERVES . WE NEED AN ECONOMY THAT IS CREATING PROSPERITY FOR EVERYONE . WE NEED JOBS FOR THOSE WERE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY . I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO ONCE AGAIN PAYS ATTENTION TO THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS , NOT TO THE WEALTHY AND THE WELL-CONNECTED WHO HAVE DONE UNKNOWNWORD WELL FOR THEMSELVES UNDER GEORGE W . BUSH . WE ARE GOING TO CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW , GOOD JOBS STARTING WITH MAKING ENERGY OUR HIGHEST PRIORITY . MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL NO LONGER BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL . WE WILL ENHANCE OUR SECURITY . WE WILL DEAL WITH GLOBAL WARMING AND WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED . IF WE DO THIS , IT WILL BE THE EQUIVALENT OF THE APOLLO MOON SHOT . THIS IS UP TO THIS GENERATION BUT YOU NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD AND WILL CLEAR AWAY THE SPECIAL INTEREST FROM THE OIL-COMPANIES TO THE OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRIES . AND ONCE AGAIN PROVIDE THE KIND OF ENTHUSIASTIC EMBRACE OF A PROBLEM AMERICA IS EQUIPPED TO SOLVE . WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO EDUCATION STARTING WITH UNIVERSAL PRE - KINDERGARTEN , ENDING THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND THAT HAS INTERFERED WITH TEACHING AND LEARNING IN OUR SCHOOLS . MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AND YES , PAYING MORE ATTENTION TO THE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE . GIVING THEM THE OPPORTUNITIES TO PURSUE THE AMERICAN DREAM . WE NEED TO REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT . IT IS TIME THAT WE ENDED THE CRONYISM AND THE NO-BID CONTRACTS , THAT WE SAID ONCE AND FOR ALL HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE POSITIONS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AGAIN . WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING TO RESTORE OUR INTERNATIONAL LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY . IT STARTS WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME . I HAVE SAID THAT AS SOON AS I'M INAUGURATED , I WILL HAVE THE JOINT UNKNOWNWORD , THE SECRETARY OF DEFENSE , AND MY SECURITY ADVISERS DRAW UP THE PLANS NECESSARY TO BEGIN WITHDRAWING OUR TROOPS WITHIN 60 DAYS . BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS NOT PLANNED BECAUSE THEY DO NOT INTEND TO WITHDRAW . IT IS DANGEROUS TO WITHDRAW TROOPS . IT IS DANGEROUS TO TAKE OUT OUR CONVOYS WITH OUR MEN AND WOMEN AND OUR EQUIPMENT DOWN THOSE SAME CORRIDORS THAT HAVE BEEN THE SUBJECT OF SO MANY ATTACKS , SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD , SO MANY INJURIES . IT'S ALSO IMPORTANT THAT WE THINK ABOUT THE CIVILIANS , AMERICAN CITIZENS , WHO ARE WORKING FOR THE EMBASSY , WORKING FOR COMPANIES , WORKING FOR NOT-FOR-PROFIT AGENCIES . THEY HAVE TO COME OUT , TOO . IT WOULD BE DISHONORABLE FOR US TO TURN OUR BACKS ON THOSE IRAQIS WHO HELPED US -WHO WERE THE TRANSLATORS AND THE DRIVERS WHO PUT THEIR OWN LIVES AT RISK IN ORDER TO SAVE THE LIVES OF AMERICANS AND IRAQIS . I WILL MAKE IT CLEAR TO THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT THAT THE BLANK CHECK THAT GEORGE BUSH GAVE THEM IS NO LONGER UNKNOWNWORD . THEY HAVE TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN FUTURE . WHEN WE BRING OUR TROOPS HOME , LET'S TAKE CARE OF THEM . THEY HAVE NOT BEEN GIVEN THE HEALTH CARE , THE COMPENSATION , AND THE SUPPORT THAT THEY SO RICHLY HAVE EARNED . THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE . IT WILL START ON JANUARY 20 , 2009 . WHEN THE NEXT PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE OVAL OFFICE , ALL OF THESE CHALLENGES WILL BE WAITING . BUT SO WILL OPPORTUNITIES - OPPORTUNITIES TO PRESERVE OUR LIBERTY AND CREATE NEW POSSIBILITIES FOR AMERICANS , PARTICULARLY YOUNG AMERICANS . AND ALSO TO KEEP US MOVING UNKNOWNWORD A MORE PERFECT UNION . I KNOW THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL EMBODY THE HOPES AND DREAMS OF ALL OF US . I ALSO KNOW THAT THEY CANNOT BE FALSE HOPES . WE HAVE TO PICK A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB . THE TOUGH , DIFFICULT JOB THAT WILL AWAIT . THERE ARE TWO BIG QUESTIONS FOR VOTERS IN NEW HAMPSHIRE . ONE IS WHO WILL BE THE BEST PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE ? THE SECOND IS WHO CAN WE NOMINATE WHO WILL GO THE DISTANCE AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS ? THE REPUBLICANS ARE NOT GOING TO GIVE UP THE WHITE HOUSE WITHOUT A FIGHT . NOW THEY SHOULD . THEY SHOULD BASICALLY SAY .WE ARE ASHAMED OF WHAT WE HAVE DONE TO OUR COUNTRY FOR THE LAST SEVEN YEARS .. BUT I DON'T THINK THAT IS WHAT WE WILL HEAR FROM THEM . AND I KNOW , HAVING BEEN ON THE RECEIVING END OF ALL THE INCOMING FIRE , THAT THEY TRAIN ON DEMOCRATS . NOW FOR 16 YEARS - THAT MUCH TO THEIR DISMAY , I AM STILL HERE . I AM STILL STANDING . AND I AM STILL FIGHTING FOR YOU . SO HERE IS WHAT I WILL DO FOR THE NEXT DAYS . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ALL OF YOU HERE TONIGHT AND THE THOUSANDS MORE WHO CAN'T BE HERE . WHEN YOU GO TO VOTE ON TUESDAY , YOU ARE VOTING NOT ONLY YOUR OWN INTERESTS , YOUR OWN NEEDS , YOUR OWN VALUES . BUT THE REST OF AMERICA AND THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING AS WELL . THIS ELECTION IS NOT ONLY ABOUT OUR COUNTRY . IT IS ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN RESTORE AMERICA'S POSITION , WHETHER WE CAN FIND COMMON GROUND . I HAVE BEEN MAKING CHANGE FOR 35 YEARS . IN THE YEARS IN THE SENATE , I HAVE FOUND A LOT OF COMMON GROUND WITH REPUBLICANS . WHEREVER WE COULD , WE HAVE WORKED TOGETHER TO BRING RESPITE CARE TO CAREGIVERS AND HEALTH CARE TO NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS . BUT I ALSO KNOW HOW TO STAND MY GROUND . I HAVE STOOD AGAINST GEORGE BUSH'S MEDICARE PRESCRIPTION DRUG BENEFIT FOR THE DRUG COMPANIES AND THE INSURANCE COMPANIES . I HAVE STOOD AGAINST HIS PROPOSAL TO UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY , SOMETHING THAT WILL NEVER HAPPEN AS LONG AS I HAVE ANYTHING TO SAY ABOUT IT . I KNOW THAT WE'VE GOT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER TO THE DIVIDE THAT TOO OFTEN SEPARATES AMERICANS . WE ALSO HAVE TO STAND FOR DEMOCRATIC PRINCIPLES . I AM PROUD TO BE A DEMOCRAT . I AM PROUD TO BE A MEMBER OF THE LONGEST LASTING POLITICAL PARTY IN THE WORLD . I AM PROUD OF THOSE WHO HAVE BEEN OUR STANDARD BEARERS -- I AM PROUD OF THE PROGRESS THAT WE MADE DURING THE 1990S UNDER THE LAST DEMOCRAT ELECTED TWICE IN THE UNITED STATES . I KNOW THAT WE CAN DO THIS AGAIN . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I LOVE THIS COUNTRY . BECAUSE IT HAS GIVEN ME SO MUCH AND I BELIEVE IT IS MY RESPONSIBILITY TO GIVE BACK . I KNOW EVERY SINGLE DAY , THE PEOPLE WHO ARE HOPING AND PRAYING , THAT THEY ONCE AGAIN HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WORRIES ABOUT THEIR LIVES , THEIR CHILDREN , THEIR FUTURES . I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT . I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT THE PEOPLE I HAVE MET IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , ROLLING UP MY SLEEVES WORKING TO SOLVE THE PROBLEMS THAT YOU , YOUR FRIENDS , YOUR FAMILIES , YOUR NEIGHBORS FACE . IF YOU GIVE ME THAT CHANCE TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT , I KNOW THAT TOGETHER WE WILL NOT ONLY RESTORE PRIDE IN AMERICA , RESTORE OUR POSITION AROUND THE WORLD AND REBUILD THE MIDDLE CLASS , REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . AND YES , TOGETHER , WE WILL MAKE HISTORY . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU SO MUCH . WE'RE GOING TO TAKE THIS ENTHUSIASM AND GO RIGHT TO NEW HAMPSHIRE TONIGHT . THIS IS A GREAT NIGHT FOR DEMOCRATS . WE HAVE SEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED TURNOUT HERE IN IOWA AND THAT IS GOOD NEWS BECAUSE TODAY WE'RE SENDING A CLEAR MESSAGE - THAT WE ARE GOING TO HAVE CHANGE AND THAT CHANGE WILL BE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT IN THE WHITE HOUSE IN 2009 . I AM SO PROUD TO HAVE RUN WITH SUCH EXCEPTIONAL CANDIDATES . I CONGRATULATE SENATOR OBAMA AND SENATOR EDWARDS . I THANK SENATOR DODD AND SENATOR BIDEN AND GOVERNOR RICHARDSON AND CONGRESSMAN KUCINICH . TOGETHER WE HAVE PRESENTED THE CASE FOR CHANGE AND HAVE MADE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR THAT AMERICA NEEDS A NEW BEGINNING . I AM AS READY AS I CAN BE AFTER HAVING HAD THIS INCREDIBLE EXPERIENCE HERE IN IOWA , STARTING OUT A LONG TIME AGO AND MAKING THIS JOURNEY WITH SO MANY PEOPLE WHO HAVE BECOME MY FRIENDS AND WHO I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR THEIR HARD WORK AND SUPPORT - THOSE FROM IOWA , THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM AROUND THE COUNTRY . AND THE PEOPLE WHO WERE THERE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD EXPECTATIONS ABOUT WHAT IT WOULD MEAN TO HAVE THE CAUCUSES THIS YEAR , I THANK YOU . I THANK EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU FOR COMING OUT AND STANDING UP FOR A DEMOCRAT . WHAT IS MOST IMPORTANT NOW IS THAT AS WE GO ON WITH THIS CONTEST THAT WE KEEP FOCUSED ON THE TWO BIG ISSUES , THAT WE ANSWER CORRECTLY THE QUESTIONS THAT EACH OF US HAS POSED : HOW WILL WE WIN IN NOVEMBER 2008 BY UNKNOWNWORD A CANDIDATE WHO WILL BE ABLE TO GO THE DISTANCE AND WHO WILL BE THE BEST PRESIDENT ON DAY ONE ? I AM READY FOR THAT CONTEST . WE HAVE ALWAYS PLANNED TO RUN A NATIONAL CAMPAIGN ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EARLY CONTESTS BECAUSE I WANT THE PEOPLE OF AMERICA , AND PARTICULARLY DEMOCRATS AND UNKNOWNWORD INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE SEEN THE LIGHT TO UNDERSTAND - NUMBER ONE - THAT THE STAKES ARE HUGE , THAT THE JOB IS ENORMOUS , BUT THAT I BELIEVE WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THE RIGHT DECISION . THERE WILL BE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WILL GET INVOLVED AS THEY HAVE HERE IN IOWA - OF ALL AGES . THAT IS WHAT WE WANT BECAUSE WE'RE NOT JUST TRYING TO ELECT A PRESIDENT , WE'RE TRYING TO CHANGE OUR COUNTRY . THAT IS WHAT I AM COMMITTED TO DOING . I HAVE SET BIG GOALS FOR OUR COUNTRY . I WANT TO REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS AND TO ME , THAT IS THE MOST IMPORTANT JOB THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE HERE AT HOME , BECAUSE IF WE DON'T BEGIN TO PAY ATTENTION TO THE PEOPLE WHO DO THE WORK AND RAISE THE FAMILIES AND MAKE THIS COUNTRY GREAT , WE WILL NOT RECOGNIZE AMERICA IN A FEW YEARS . I WANT TO MAKE IT ABSOLUTELY CLEAR I INTEND TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY IN THE WORLD AND WE'RE GOING TO TACKLE ALL OF THE PROBLEMS THAT ARE GOING TO BE INHERITED BECAUSE OF THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION , INCLUDING ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AND THEN GIVING THEM THE SUPPORT THAT THEY NEED . WE'RE GOING TO REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT . WE'RE GOING TO MAKE SURE THAT IT IS NOT THE GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW , BY THE FEW , AND FOR THE FEW , BUT IT ACTUALLY WORKS FOR EVERY AMERICAN AGAIN . AND WE'RE GOING TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . I HAVE DONE THIS WORK FOR 35 YEARS . IT IS THE WORK OF MY LIFETIME . I HAVE BEEN INVOLVED IN MAKING IT POSSIBLE FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO HAVE A BETTER EDUCATION AND FOR PEOPLE OF ALL AGES TO HAVE HEALTH CARE AND THAT TRANSFORMING WORK IS WHAT WE DESPERATELY NEED IN OUR COUNTRY AGAIN . I AM SO READY FOR THE REST OF THIS CAMPAIGN AND I AM SO READY TO LEAD . IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT WE CAN HAVE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY AMERICAN , THEN I'M YOUR CANDIDATE . AND IF YOU'RE CONCERNED ABOUT WHETHER WE CAN HAVE AN ENERGY POLICY THAT WILL BREAK THE SHACKLES OF OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND SET FORTH A NEW SET OF GOALS FOR US TO MEET TOGETHER , THEN I'M YOUR CANDIDATE . AND IF YOU ARE WORRIED ABOUT , ONCE AND FOR ALL , TAKING ON GLOBAL WARMING ; MAKING IT CLEAR THAT WE WILL END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ; THAT WE WILL MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN ; THAT WE WILL BE , ONCE AGAIN , THE COUNTRY OF VALUES AND IDEALS THAT WE CHERISH SO MUCH , THEN PLEASE JOIN ME IN THIS CAMPAIGN . WE HAVE A LONG WAY TO GO BUT I AM CONFIDENT AND OPTIMISTIC , BOTH ABOUT THE CAMPAIGN BUT MAYBE MORE IMPORTANTLY ABOUT OUR COUNTRY . THIS COUNTRY DESERVES EVERYTHING WE CAN GIVE TO IT . THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO COULDN'T CAUCUS TONIGHT DESPITE THE VERY LARGE TURNOUT . THERE ARE A LOT OF IOWANS WHO ARE IN THE MILITARY . THEY WERE IN IRAQ OR AFGHANISTAN OR SOMEWHERE ELSE SERVING OUR COUNTRY AND THEY NEED A COMMANDER IN CHIEF WHO RESPECTS THEM AND WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT FORCE SHOULD BE ONLY USED AS A LAST RESORT , NOT A FIRST RESORT . THERE ARE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO WORK AT NIGHT , PEOPLE WHO ARE ON THEIR FEET , PEOPLE WHO ARE TAKING CARE OF PATIENTS IN A HOSPITAL OR WAITING ON A TABLE IN A RESTAURANT OR MAYBE IN A PATROL CAR KEEPING OUR STREETS SAFE AND THEY NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS GOING TO CARE ABOUT THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES . I WROTE A BOOK SOME YEARS AGO CALLED "IT TAKES A VILLAGE TO RAISE A CHILD " AND IN IT I HAVE A CHAPTER THAT I TITLED "EVERY CHILD NEEDS A CHAMPION ." I THINK THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS THEIR CHAMPION AND THAT IS WHAT I INTEND TO BE . I WANT TO THANK ALL THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE BEEN PART OF THIS CAMPAIGN SO FAR . I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK ALL OF MY FRIENDS HERE IN IOWA WHO HAVE WORKED SO HARD . I WANT TO THANK THOSE WHO HAVE COME FROM ACROSS AMERICA . I WANT TO THANK ALL OF THE UNIONS , THE MORE THAN SIX MILLION UNION MEMBERS WHO SUPPORT MY CANDIDACY . I KNOW THAT WE ARE GOING TO GET UP TOMORROW AND KEEP UNKNOWNWORD AS HARD AS WE CAN TO GET THE MESSAGE OUT ABOUT WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION BECAUSE WE KNOW THAT IT IS LITERALLY THE FUTURE OF OUR COUNTRY . THANK YOU ALL SO VERY MUCH FOR CARING ENOUGH TO BE INVOLVED IN POLITICS , FOR GIVING OF YOUR TIME AND YOUR RESOURCES , FOR UNDERSTANDING THAT THIS GREAT DEMOCRACY OF OURS DESERVES TO HAVE ALL OF OUR BEST EFFORTS AND I PROMISE YOU , THIS CAMPAIGN THAT I AM RUNNING WILL CERTAINLY HAVE MINE AND I ASK FOR YOURS AS WELL . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH . GOD BLESS YOU .
BLUE	THANK YOU SO MUCH . I THINK THE BEST THING FOR ME TO DO IS JUST SAY THANK YOU VERY MUCH . I AM VERY GRATEFUL TO SO MANY OF YOU FOR COMING OUT THIS MORNING AND BEING PART OF THIS EVENT HERE IN JOHNSTON . IT IS VERY EXCITING FOR ME TO HAVE SO MANY OF MY FRIENDS FROM MY ENTIRE LIFE WHO HAVE COME OUT HERE TO TALK WITH IOWANS , TO ANSWER QUESTIONS , TO GIVE YOU SOME INSIGHT AND INFORMATION ABOUT OUR UNKNOWNWORD , ABOUT WHAT I'VE BEEN TRYING TO DO FOR MY ENTIRE LIFE AND PARTICULARLY AS AN ADULT . THERE ARE SO MANY PEOPLE WHO FEEL INVISIBLE RIGHT NOW . THEY FEEL LIKE NOBODY IS LISTENING . THEY DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES AND THEY DON'T KNOW WHAT THEY ARE GOING TO DO . OR THEY HAVE JUST BEEN TOLD THEIR JOB IS GOING TO BE MOVED OVERSEAS AND THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE HOW THEY ARE GOING TO KEEP GOING . OR THEY ARE COUNTING PENNIES AT THE TABLE TRYING TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY CAN PAY TO FILL THE TANK IN THEIR CAR OR THEIR TRUCK . I THINK IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS OF A PRESIDENT , OF ANYBODY IN PUBLIC LIFE BECAUSE IT IS SUCH A PUBLIC TRUST , TO REALLY LISTEN AND TO REACH OUT AND TO LEARN AND TO WORK AS HARD AS YOU CAN TO MAKE A DIFFERENCE . TO TRY TO HELP PEOPLE WHO ARE DOING THE BEST THEY CAN , BUT SOMETIMES LIFE HAS A WAY OF HITTING YOU UPSIDE THE HEAD . I WAS LISTENING TO MY FRIENDS TALK AND I WAS THINKING ABOUT EACH ONE OF THEM . BONNIE CAMPBELL , WHO'S BEEN A LEADER HERE IN IOWA AND DID JUST WONDERFUL WORK FOR OUR COUNTRY WHEN SHE WAS IN THE JUSTICE DEPARTMENT DURING MY HUSBAND'S PRESIDENCY . I THINK ABOUT HER WITH HER HUSBAND ED , AND HOW DEVOTED SHE IS TO HIM AND HOW CARING SHE IS IN MAKING SURE THAT HE IS ALWAYS TAKEN CARE OF AND INCLUDED . THAT KIND OF SUMS UP THE WAY WE ALL LIVE . WE ARE NOT ALL THE SAME IN EVERY SETTING WE FIND OURSELVES , ARE WE ? WHEN YOU'RE WITH YOUR FAMILY , YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK . WHEN YOU'RE AT WORK , YOU'RE GOING TO BE A LITTLE BIT DIFFERENT THAN WHEN YOU'RE AT THE MALL . THAT ALL ADDS UP TO THE PEOPLE WE ARE . EVERY TIME I THINK OF BONNIE CAMPBELL , I THINK ABOUT THE WORK SHE'S DONE FOR THOSE WHO WILL NEVER KNOW HER NAME AND ALL SHE'S DONE FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE VERY CLOSE AND PERSONAL TO HER . I'M VERY PROUD THAT SHE'S MY FRIEND . JEFF UNKNOWNWORD IS SOMEONE WHO CAME INTO MY LIFE BECAUSE OF WHAT HAPPENED TO HIS FAMILY DOWN IN NEW ORLEANS DURING HURRICANE KATRINA . I WAS GRATEFUL THAT WE WERE ABLE TO GIVE HIM SOME HELP , SOME ADVICE , SOME INFORMATION WHEN HE WAS , AS ANY PERSON WOULD BE , WORRIED ABOUT HIS FAMILY . WHEN I MET HIM HE STARTED OUT BY SAYING 'I'M A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN .' I SAID 'WELL , THAT'S OK , MY DAD WAS A CONSERVATIVE REPUBLICAN . BUT HE EVOLVED .' I HAVE GOTTEN TO KNOW JEFF AND HIS FAMILY AND I AM SO GRATEFUL FOR HIS SUPPORT . IT MEANS A LOT TO ME TO HAVE SOMEONE WHO KNOWS WE'VE GOT TO CROSS PARTY LINES . THAT WHAT'S MOST IMPORTANT IS THAT INSTEAD OF ACTING LIKE DEMOCRATS OR REPUBLICANS , WE START ACTING LIKE AMERICANS AGAIN AND ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS TOGETHER . [APPLAUSE ] I SO APPRECIATE SHANNON COMING ALL THIS WAY BECAUSE SHE HAS A VERY DEMANDING LIFE AND HER WONDERFUL DAUGHTER IS GETTING SUCH LOVE AND ATTENTION FROM A MOM WHO ADORES HER , WHO DOES EVERYTHING SHE CAN FOR HER . I'VE MET A LOT OF MOMS LIKE SHANNON OVER MANY YEARS , WHO DON'T KNOW WHERE TO TURN . I'VE MET A LOT OF DADS WHO CAN'T FIGURE OUT HOW THEY ARE SUPPOSED TO TAKE CARE OF THE PERSON THEY LOVE THE MOST , A CHILD WHO'S BEEN STRICKEN WITH AN UNKNOWNWORD MAYBE THEY'VE NEVER HEARD OF , OR HAD AN ACCIDENT , AND NOW NEEDS SO MUCH CARE . THESE ARE PEOPLE THAT I THINK EVERY ONE OF US CAN UNKNOWNWORD TO , WHETHER ANYTHING TRAGIC AND BAD HAS HAPPENED TO US PERSONALLY , WE KNOW PEOPLE WHO HAVE FACED THE SAME DILEMMA THAT SHANNON AND HER FAMILY FACED . I BELIEVE I HAVE A GREAT HONOR AND A PRIVILEGE TO BE IN PUBLIC OFFICE . WHAT I TRY TO DO EVERYDAY IS FIGURE OUT HOW TO HELP SOMEBODY . YOU CAN'T ALWAYS PASS THE LAWS YOU WANT TO PASS RIGHT AWAY . YOU CAN'T SNAP YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND GET PEOPLE TO COOPERATE . YOU HAVE TO WORK ON THAT EVERY MINUTE OF EVERY DAY . BUT YOU CAN TRY TO HELP SOMEBODY EVERY SINGLE DAY . I HAVE TRIED TO DO THAT AS A PUBLIC SERVANT , AS AN ACTIVIST , AND NOW AS A SENATOR AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT . BECAUSE I WANT TO HELP THOSE PEOPLE LIKE SHANNON AND SO MANY OTHERS WHO DESERVE OUR HELP . MY FRIEND BESTY , WHOM I MET IN 6TH GRADE - IN MRS . KING'S CLASS - HAS BEEN WITH ME THROUGH THICK AND THIN , THAT'S NOT JUST A REFLECTION ON HOW WE LOOK TODAY . ABOUT THE GOOD TIMES AND THE NOT SO GOOD TIMES , WE BOTH HAVE TO DO BETTER ON THE OTHER PART . IN JUNIOR HIGH AND HIGH SCHOOL , I UNKNOWNWORD REALLY THICK GLASSES , WHICH I REALLY HATED . THERE WAS ALWAYS SOME BOY OR ANOTHER THAT I WAS HOPING WOULD NOTICE ME , SO I USED TO TAKE THEM OFF AND THAT MEANT I DID NOT KNOW WHERE I WAS GOING . BETSY WOULD UNKNOWNWORD TO MEET ME SO THAT WE COULD WALK DOWN THE UNKNOWNWORD TOGETHER SO I WOULD NOT BUMP INTO A LOCKER , BUT ALSO SO SHE COULD SAY , UNKNOWNWORD IS ON THE RIGHT .' I COULD SAY , UNKNOWNWORD , DON ,' LIKE I ACTUALLY DID SEE HIM . SHE'S BEEN GUIDING ME AROUND EVER SINCE . I'M SO PLEASED SHE COULD BE HERE . SHE AND HER FAMILY ARE VERY IMPORTANT TO MINE . EACH ONE OF US COULD TELL STORIES LIKE THIS , ABOUT THE PEOPLE WHO YOU KNOW AND THE PEOPLE WHO KNOW YOU . HERE IN IOWA , I WANT YOU TO HAVE SOME FLAVOR OF WHO I AM OUTSIDE OF THE TELEVISION CAMERAS - WHEN ALL OF THE CAMERAS AND THE LIGHTS DISAPPEAR , WHAT I DO WHEN NOBODY'S LISTENING OR TAKING NOTES , AND RECORDING IT . BECAUSE IT IS HARD WHEN YOU'RE IN PUBLIC LIFE TO HAVE THAT KIND OF SHARING EXPERIENCE WITH THOUSANDS AND MILLIONS OF PEOPLE . ON OUR 99-COUNTY BLITZ , WHICH WE STARTED YESTERDAY , I'M GOING TO GET TO AS MANY PLACES AS I CAN , BUT SO ARE MY FRIENDS . AND PEOPLE WHOM I'VE WORKED WITH , AND FOR , OVER A LIFETIME . I THINK THIS ELECTION IS ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT THAT WE'VE EVER HAD . THERE'S A BIG RESPONSIBILITY FACING IOWANS BECAUSE YOU GET TO MAKE THE FIRST CHOICE . NOT JUST THE COUNTRY , BUT THE WORLD WILL BE WATCHING . WE ALL KNOW THAT WE NEED NEW LEADERSHIP . BUT IT'S NOT JUST CHANGING WHO LIVES IN THE WHITE HOUSE , IT'S HAVING A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO LEAD TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ALL OF US KNOW ARE NECESSARY . I'VE BEEN MAKING CHANGE MY ENTIRE LIFE . FOR 35 YEARS AS AN ADULT , I'VE WORKED TO TRY TO HELP KIDS WITH DISABILITIES GET INTO PUBLIC SCHOOLS BACK IN THE EARLY 70S WHEN I WORKED FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . I WORKED IN ARKANSAS TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION , AND I HAVE FRIENDS FROM ARKANSAS WHO ARE HERE TODAY WHO HAVE BEEN DEAR FRIENDS TO ME . I KNOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE IT MAKES WHEN PEOPLE ARE REALLY COMMITTED TO TRYING TO EXPAND OPPORTUNITY BEYOND WHERE IT IS TO WHAT IT CAN BE . I WAS PRIVILEGED TO SPEND THOSE EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AS PART OF THE TEAM AROUND MY HUSBAND , AND TO WORK ON EXPANDING HEALTH CARE TO EVERY AMERICAN - QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE . THAT'S A HARD JOB . UNKNOWNWORD OF PEOPLE HAVE TRIED - HARRY TRUMAN , EVEN RICHARD NIXON - BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND IT'S THE SMART DECISION FOR US TO MAKE AS A NATION . BUT WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL THAT FIRST TIME . BUT I THINK YOU ACTUALLY LEARN MORE ABOUT PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAY NOT BE SUCCESSFUL THAN IF THEY JUST SLOPE THROUGH LIFE . I HAD A CHOICE : I COULD HAVE SAID 'OK , WE DIDN'T DO IT , I'M NOT TRYING ANYMORE .' OR , WHAT I DECIDED TO DO WAS TO SAY 'OK , WE DIDN'T DO IT , LET'S REGROUP AND SEE WHAT WE CAN GET DONE .' THAT'S WHY I WORKED TO MAKE SURE THAT ALL OUR CHILDREN WERE IMMUNIZED , AND THAT DRUG COMPANIES WERE REQUIRED TO TEST DRUGS BEFORE THEY GAVE THEM TO CHILDREN . THEN I WENT TO WORK TO HELP CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND NOW 6 MILLION CHILDREN HAVE HEALTH CARE WHO WOULDN'T HAVE HAD IT OTHERWISE'WE'RE TRYING TO OVERCOME THE PRESIDENT'S VETOES OF GIVING HEALTH CARE TO EVEN MORE CHILDREN . IN THE SENATE I HAVE WORKED ACROSS PARTY LINES AND I HAVE DONE THAT IN ORDER TO GET WORK DONE THAT WOULD HELP PEOPLE . BETSY WAS KIDDING ABOUT THE WAY I UNKNOWNWORD MYSELF IN ALL OF THE ISSUES AFFECTING NEW UNKNOWNWORD INCLUDING UNKNOWNWORD FARMERS , OUR FRUIT AND VEGETABLE FARMERS , AND SO MANY ELSE . FOR ME IT IS ABOUT GETTING UP EVERY DAY AND WORKING AS HARD AS YOU CAN SO THAT WHEN WE FOUND OUT THE NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVES DIDN'T HAVE HEALTH CARE , I TEAMED UP WITH A REPUBLICAN SENATOR , LINDSAY GRAHAM OF SOUTH CAROLINA . OVER THE OPPOSITION OF THE PENTAGON AND THE OPPOSITION OF THE WHITE HOUSE , WE PASSED HEALTH CARE FOR GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS , LIKE SO MANY WHO HAVE LEFT HERE FROM IOWA . WHEN WE SAW THAT OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WERE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ WITH SOMETHING THAT WAS BEING CALLED TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY AND REALIZED THAT NOBODY WAS PAYING ATTENTION , I WENT TO WORK . I WROTE AND HELPED TO PASS THE FIRST LEGISLATION THAT ADDRESSED THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY PROBLEM . WHEN WE STARTED HEARING ABOUT HOW FAMILIES - WHEN THEY HAD AN INJURED SON OR DAUGHTER COMING BACK FROM WAR , THEY COULDN'T TAKE ENOUGH TIME OFF FROM WORK WITHOUT LOSING THEIR JOB TO BE THERE BY THE SIDE OF THEIR SON OR DAUGHTER - I TEAMED UP WITH CHRIS DODD AND REPUBLICANS AND WE PASSED AN EXTENSION OF THE FAMILY LEAVE ACT SO IF YOU'RE SON OR YOUR DAUGHTER IS INJURED , YOU DON'T HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT LOSING YOUR JOB . YOU ARE PROTECTED . YOU CAN BE THERE DURING THAT MOST IMPORTANT PERIOD . THESE ARE REAL PROBLEMS THAT REAL AMERICANS FACE . THERE'S NOTHING ABSTRACT ABOUT IT . IT'S WHAT I HEAR ABOUT EVERY SINGLE DAY . EVERYBODY TALKS ABOUT CHANGE IN THIS ELECTION . PEOPLE HAVE DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT HOW TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU CAN GET CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU CAN GET CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT . I BELIEVE THE WAY YOU GET CHANGE IS BY WORKING HARD FOR IT . PERSISTENCE , PERSEVERANCE , EVEN SOME PERSPIRATION - THAT IS HOW YOU CHANGE LIVES , YOU CHANGE INSTITUTIONS . THAT IS WHAT I HAVE DONE MY WHOLE LIFE . THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT . BECAUSE I INTEND TO GIVE AMERICA A NEW BEGINNING . THE WHOLE WORLD WILL BREATHE A SIGH OF RELIEF WHEN GEORGE BUSH LEAVES THE WHITE HOUSE . [APPLAUSE ] AND THEN WE DO HAVE TO GET TO WORK , DON'T WE ? WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING IN HEALTH CARE . I HAVE PROPOSED A PLAN , THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN THAT WILL PROVIDE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE . AND HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK . IF YOU HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE AND YOU'RE HAPPY WITH IT , NOTHING CHANGES . BUT IF YOU DON'T HAVE HEALTH INSURANCE OR IF THE HEALTH INSURANCE YOU HAVE DOESN'T COVER WHAT'S CALLED A UNKNOWNWORD CONDITION ; YOU'RE A DIABETIC AND IT WON'T COVER YOUR DIABETES . YOU HAVE A HEART CONDITION AND IT WON'T COVER YOUR HEART CONDITION . SO IT'S REALLY NOT INSURING YOU FOR WHAT YOU NEED MOST . IT'S TOO EXPENSIVE . YOU WILL BE ABLE TO HAVE NEW CHOICES . I WANT TO OPEN UP THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN TO EVERY AMERICAN . IT'S A GOOD PLAN . OVER 250 CHOICES , PRIVATE INSURANCE COMPANY CHOICES THAT YOU CAN DECIDE HOW BEST SUITS YOU AT AN AVERAGE COST BELOW WHAT YOU CAN GET THROUGH AN EMPLOYER OR IN THE PRIVATE MARKETPLACE . EVERY FEDERAL EMPLOYEE HAS ACCESS TO THIS PLAN AND YOU PAY FOR IT BECAUSE YOU PAY THE BULK OF IT , BECAUSE IT IS PAID FOR OUT OF TAX DOLLARS . ABOUT 75 % OF IT . I FIGURE IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR EVERY AMERICAN TO HAVE THOSE SAME CHOICES AT THE SAME AFFORDABLE COST . WE'RE GOING TO HELP PEOPLE WHO HAVE A LITTLE TROUBLE UNKNOWNWORD IT WITH HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS . WE'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE PREVENTION BECAUSE WE'RE NOW NOT PAYING FOR PREVENTION AND THEREFORE WE PAY MORE WHEN SOMEBODY GETS REALLY SICK . WE'RE GOING TO EMPHASIZE CHRONIC CARE MANAGEMENT , WE'RE GOING TO TAKE BETTER CARE OF PEOPLE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD ILL . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE ELECTRONIC MEDICAL RECORDS , SOMETHING I WORKED ON WITH NEWT UNKNOWNWORD AND BILL FRIST WHICH RAISED SOME EYEBROWS IN WASHINGTON . I BELIEVE WE CAN MOVE TOWARD A HEALTH CARE SYSTEM THAT COVERS EVERYONE , THAT DECREASES COSTS FOR EVERYONE , AND IMPROVES QUALITY FOR EVERYONE . WHEN I WAS FINALIZING MY HEALTH CARE PLAN , THERE WERE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO SAID TO ME , 'YOU KNOW TRYING TO COVER EVERYBODY IS CONTROVERSIAL . IT'S GOING TO ENGENDER ALL OF THE USUAL TALKING POINTS FROM THE OTHER SIDE . SO YOU REALLY SHOULDN'T START BEING SO AMBITIOUS . I ASKED PEOPLE , 'IN OTHER WORDS , YOU WANT ME TO LEAVE OUT MILLIONS OF PEOPLE FROM MY HEALTH CARE PLAN ?' WELL OK , WHO DO WE LEAVE OUT ? DO WE LEAVE OUT SHANNON'S DAUGHTER , ISABELLA ? PEOPLE SAY THAT SHE HAS A DETERIORATING CONDITION . MAYBE WE JUST LEAVE HER OUT OF HEALTH CARE . DO WE LEAVE OUT THE YOUNG COUPLE I MET IN WEBSTER CITY WHO OWN AN AUTO BODY SHOP ? THEY CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR KID . THEY'RE WORKING AS HARD AS THEY CAN . MAYBE WE SHOULD JUST LEAVE THEM OUT AND HOPE THEY STAY HEALTHY . OR MAYBE I SHOULD LEAVE THE NURSE OUT FROM WATERLOO I MET , WHO WAS DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER . THE TREATMENT MADE HER REALLY SICK . SHE COULDN'T GO TO WORK . BY THE TIME SHE GOT BACK TO WORK , SHE FOUND OUT SHE DIDN'T HAVE A JOB ANYMORE . WHEN SHE LOST HER JOB , SHE LOST HER HEALTH CARE . MAYBE WE SHOULD LEAVE HER OUT . I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON OUR PROBLEMS . I WANT TO SOLVE OUR PROBLEMS , ONCE AND FOR ALL AND I WANT TO START BY SETTING FORTH A PLAN THAT WILL DO THAT . [APPLAUSE ] MAYBE WE CAN GET A NEW BEGINNING IN ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING . THIS IS AN AREA THAT WE HAVE TO ACT ON . WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THOSE WHO PRODUCE OIL . THEY'VE GOT US OVER A BARREL , THE OIL BARREL . THAT BARREL IS NOW ABOUT $100 A BARREL . IT WAS $20 WHEN GEORGE BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT . NOW WE ARE SPENDING MORE AND MORE MONEY SENDING IT TO COUNTRIES THAT OFTEN TURN AROUND AND USE THAT MONEY AGAINST US . I THINK WE CAN DO A LOT BETTER . I HAVE PROPOSED A COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR SECURITY , THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ENVIRONMENT BECAUSE WE DO HAVE TO DEAL WITH THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS IN OUR ATMOSPHERE , AND THAT WILL BE GOOD FOR OUR ECONOMY . I BELIEVE IF YOU JUST FOLLOW THE EXAMPLE OF IOWA , AND WHAT HAS BEEN DONE HERE WITH BIO-FUELS AND WIND , WE WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS ACROSS AMERICA . THESE ARE JOBS THAT CAN'T BE OUTSOURCED . THESE ARE JOBS THAT WILL BE DONE RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND RIGHT HERE IN OUR NATION . THAT'S THE KIND OF ENERGY FUTURE THAT I'M CONVINCED WE HAVE . WE SHOULD TREAT THIS LIKE THE APOLLO MOON SHOT . WHEN I WAS A LITTLE GIRL , THAT LIFTED OUR SIGHTS AND IT ALSO CREATED A LOT OF JOBS AND A LOT OF SPINOFF . THE INTERNET ACTUALLY CAME OUT OF RESEARCH THAT WAS DONE ON THE SPACE PROGRAM . WHO KNOWS WHAT WE WILL INVENT IF WE GET SERIOUS ABOUT ENERGY AND GLOBAL WARMING . LET'S UNLEASH THE INNOVATIVE GENIUS OF AMERICA AGAIN . THERE ISN'T ANYTHING WE CAN'T DO IF WE PUT OUR MINDS TO IT . [APPLAUSE ] I WANT A NEW BEGINNING IN EDUCATION . EDUCATION BEGINS IN THE FAMILY AND WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES GET THE TOOLS AND RESOURCES THEY NEED TO TAKE CARE OF THEIR OWN CHILDREN . THAT'S ALSO WORK THAT I'VE DONE A VERY LONG TIME . GOING BACK TO MY UNKNOWNWORD YEARS WHEN THROUGH MY CHURCH , I WAS INVOLVED IN ALL KINDS OF ACTIVITIES AFFECTING SMALL CHILDREN THAT HAD SOME DIFFICULTIES , THAT HAD SOME DISADVANTAGES TO OVERCOME . I WANT TO DO MORE TO HELP FAMILIES . I WANT TO HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM , AGAIN - LIKE WHAT YOU ARE DOING HERE IN IOWA TO HELP EVERY CHILD , ESPECIALLY FROM DISADVANTAGED BACKGROUNDS GET BETTER PREPARED . AND I WANT TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND WHICH HAS INTERFERED WITH LEARNING AND TEACHING . [APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE TO START REIMAGINING EDUCATION . IT'S THE 21ST CENTURY . I GO INTO CLASSROOMS ACROSS AMERICA . I WAS IN A SCHOOL IN IOWA HERE ABOUT TWO WEEKS AGO AND THERE WAS A LOT GOING ON THAT WAS DIFFERENT AND NEW AND THERE WERE COMPUTERS , BUT THE CLASSROOMS LOOKED PRETTY MUCH THE SAME AS THEY LOOKED WHEN I WAS THERE WITH BETSY BACK IN 6TH GRADE . LET'S START THINKING ABOUT HOW WE ARE GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD INSTRUCTION MORE TO MEET INDIVIDUAL CHILDREN'S NEEDS BECAUSE EVERY CHILD LEARNS DIFFERENTLY . I THINK WE'VE GOT TO DO MORE TO HELP GIVE EACH CHILD A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL ACTUALLY WORK WITH TEACHERS , AND WORK WITH OTHERS WHO CARE ABOUT IMPROVING EDUCATION THE RIGHT WAY . AND THEN WE'VE GOT TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE FOR MIDDLE CLASS AND WORKING FAMILIES . LET'S MAKE IT EASIER FOR THOSE KIDS WHO WANT TO GO TO SCHOOL . I MEET THEM ALL OVER IOWA . WHO SAY THEY DON'T KNOW HOW THEY'RE GOING TO AFFORD IT . THEY HAVE TO GO INTO SUCH DEEP DEBT . I WANT EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO IS WILLING TO WORK HARD TO GO TO COLLEGE TO BE ABLE TO AFFORD TO DO THAT . I ALSO DON'T WANT TO FORGET THAT THE MAJORITY OF OUR KIDS WILL NOT GO TO COLLEGE . LET'S START TAKING CARE OF THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO DO THE HARD WORK THAT KEEPS THE ECONOMY GOING , WHO FIGHT OUR WARS , WHO TAKE CARE OF US , WHO PROTECT US . [APPLAUSE ] EDUCATION IS STILL THE PASSPORT TO OPPORTUNITY AND WE NEED TO STAMP THAT PASSPORT , 21ST CENTURY , AND START MAKING IT WORK AGAIN . WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING WHEN IT COMES TO REFORMING OUR GOVERNMENT . NO MORE NO-BID CONTRACTS , AND CRONYISM , AND CORRUPTION , AND INCOMPETENCE , AND INSENSITIVITY . EVERY ONE OF US IS A CUSTOMER OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . I SURE DON'T THINK WE'VE BEEN GETTING VERY GOOD CUSTOMER SERVICE THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . WE CAN DO SO MUCH BETTER . WHAT I WANT TO DO IS MAKE SURE THE GOVERNMENT WORKS FOR EVERYBODY , NOT JUST FOR THE PRIVILEGED AND THE CONNECTED . THERE IS A LOT OF WORK TO BE DONE HERE , BUT WE'RE GOING TO START WITH A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION . HOW ABOUT ELECTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE FOR THE JOBS WE ASK THEM TO HOLD IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT AGAIN ; PEOPLE WHO KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SUPPOSED TO DO , ARE COMMITTED TO DOING IT , AND CAN DELIVER RESULTS ? WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A NEW BEGINNING TO AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . WE'RE GOING TO START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE POSSIBLY CAN . WE'RE GOING TO DO SOME OTHER THINGS AS WELL . WE'RE GOING TO THANK THOSE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SERVED THEIR COUNTRY BECAUSE THEY HAVE DONE EVERYTHING THEY WERE ASKED TO DO . [APPLAUSE ] BUT THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION . WE SHOULD NOT PERMIT THEM TO CONTINUE TO SERVE AS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQI CIVIL WAR . IT IS UP TO THE IRAQIS TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEIR OWN COUNTRY AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THEY WILL HAVE TO DO JUST THAT . [APPLAUSE ] WHEN OUR TROOPS COME HOME , WE HAVE TO TAKE CARE OF THEM . A LOT WILL BE NEEDING HEALTH CARE . THEY HAVE BEEN INJURED AND UNKNOWNWORD . SOME OF IT VISIBLE . THEY'VE LOST ARMS AND LEGS . THEY'VE BEEN BLINDED . SOME OF IT IS NOT SO VISIBLE . IT'S THE TRAUMATIC BRAIN INJURY . IT'S THE POST-TRAUMATIC STRESS DISORDER . A FEW MONTHS AGO I WAS AT WALTER READE VISITING WITH SOLDIERS WHO HAD COME BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN AND I MET A VERY HANDSOME YOUNG ARMY CAPTAIN , WHO HAD LOST HIS RIGHT ARM IN BAGHDAD AND LOST THE RING FINGER ON HIS LEFT HAND WHEN HIS WEDDING RING MELTED INTO HIS FINGER . I SAID , 'CAPTAIN , HOW ARE YOU DOING ? HOW'S IT COMING FOR YOU ?' HE SAYS , 'YOU KNOW , I'M LEARNING HOW TO USE THE UNKNOWNWORD . I'M FIGURING IT OUT . THEY'RE REALLY HELPFUL . THEY'RE TEACHING ME WHAT TO DO .' AND THEN HE SAID , 'BUT WHERE DO I GO TO GET MY BRAIN BACK ?' BECAUSE THOSE EXPLOSIVE DEVICES , THAT KILL AND MAIM SO MANY OF OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN , ALSO PRODUCE A CONCUSSIVE EFFECT . A PHYSICAL SHAKING OF THE BRAIN . HE SAID , 'I WENT TO WEST POINT . I NEVER HAD ANYBODY TAKE CARE OF ME . NOW MY WIFE HAS TO GIVE ME A LIST EVERY MORNING OF WHAT I HAVE TO DO , OF WHAT I DO NEXT , OF WHAT I DO THEN .' SO I WORKED TO GET LEGISLATION PASSED TO BEGIN TO DEAL WITH THESE ISSUES . I WILL PLEDGE TO YOU THAT I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO TAKES CARE OF OUR VETERANS . I THINK IT IS DISGRACEFUL THAT WE HAVE PEOPLE WAITING MONTHS FOR APPOINTMENTS . THEY CAN'T GET THEIR DISABILITY CLAIMS PROCESSED . THE PRESIDENT DOESN'T SEEM TO EITHER KNOW OR EVIDENCE ANY CONCERN . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , VETERANS ARE GOING TO GET THE HIGHEST PRIORITY TREATMENT . AND NOT JUST THOSE WHO ARE COMING BACK FROM IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , BUT ALL OUR VETERANS , PARTICULARLY FROM MY OWN GENERATION WHO SERVED IN VIETNAM , WHO NEVER GOT THE WELCOME AND THE HELP THAT THEY DESERVED TO HAVE . [APPLAUSE ] WE CAN HAVE A NEW BEGINNING IN AMERICA . BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS , AND ALL OF THE OTHER ISSUES AND CONCERNS THAT I'VE TALKED ABOUT IN MY CAMPAIGN , WITHOUT YOUR HELP . ON JANUARY 3RD YOU HAVE A BIG DECISION . I WAS THRILLED AND HONORED TO GET THE ENDORSEMENT OF THE DES MOINES REGISTER . THEY PUT US THROUGH OUR [INAUDIBLE ]. [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE NEVER SEEN A MORE GRUELING PROCESS . THEY NOT ONLY INTERVIEWED 18 OF US ONCE , THEY INTERVIEWED 8 OF US TWICE , PLUS THEY DID RESEARCH , PLUS THEY ASKED PROBING QUESTIONS IN OTHER UNKNOWNWORD WHERE THEY REALLY WERE TAKING OUR MEASURE . I WAS IN DUNLAP YESTERDAY AT A SALE UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD SALEBARN . I'VE BEEN IN SALE BARNS OFTEN , PARTICULARLY IN ARKANSAS . I WAS STANDING UP WHERE THEY SHOW THE CATTLE AND I SAID 'I'VE NEVER BEEN IN THIS POSITION ', BUT THAT'S THE WAY I FELT . I THOUGHT OK , YOU WANT TO LOOK INSIDE MY MOUTH . ALRIGHT , HAVE AT IT .' BUT AT THE END OF THAT PROCESS THEY MADE THE CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY . WE HAVE GOOD PEOPLE RUNNING . EVERYBODY BRINGS DIFFERENT EXPERIENCES , QUALIFICATIONS , DIFFERENT IDEAS ABOUT WHAT THEY WANT TO DO . BUT THE REGISTER SAID WHAT I BELIEVE - THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE . WE DON'T HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD FOR ERROR . WE'LL ALWAYS MAKE MISTAKES , WE'RE HUMAN BEINGS . BUT WE'VE GOT TO GO FOR PROVEN LEADERSHIP , THAT'S BEEN TESTED , THAT IS READY ON DAY ONE . I OFFER THAT TO THE PEOPLE OF IOWA FOR THESE CAUCUSES . I HOPE YOU WILL DECIDE TO GO AND STAND UP FOR ME IN YOUR CAUCUS . I'M SO EXCITED BY THE GROWING ENERGY AND ENTHUSIASM AND PEOPLE COMING ON BOARD FROM ACROSS THE STATE . ONE DAY I MET A 17 YEAR OLD WHO WAS JUST ABOUT TO TURN 18 , WHO IS GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME AND I HEARD ABOUT A 102-YEAR OLD MAN WHO IS DETERMINED TO GO TO THE CAUCUSES AND HAS MADE HIS 81-YEAR OLD SON PROMISE TO TAKE HIM . I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND UP FOR ME FOR ONE NIGHT AND I WILL STAND UP FOR YOU THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN . STANDING UP FOR OUR VALUES , OUR PRINCIPLES , FOR THE KIND OF CHANGE WE NEED TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER JUST AS I DID IN NEW YORK . THEN I WILL STAND UP EVERY SINGLE DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE . I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT YOU , AND ABOUT YOUR FAMILY , ABOUT YOUR JOB , AND YOUR HEALTH CARE . I WILL BE THINKING ABOUT HOW TO RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP AND OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD . AND TOGETHER WE WILL NOT ONLY MAKE HISTORY , BUT WE WILL ONCE AGAIN FEEL PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN THE COUNTRY WE LOVE . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . IT IS SUCH AN HONOR TO BE HERE , BACK IN COUNCIL BLUFFS , WITH ALL OF YOU , ESPECIALLY WITH FRIENDS LIKE CONNIE GRONSTAL AND HER DAUGHTER KATE AND HER HUSBAND MIKE . CONNIE'S A GREAT LEADER OF MY CAMPAIGN . BOTH SHE AND KATE HAVE BEEN JUST DEVOTED AND WORKING HARD . I'M SURE THEY'VE HARASSED A LOT OF YOU TO BE PART OF THE TEAM WE'RE PUTTING TOGETHER . AND I ALSO AM ABSOLUTELY OVERWHELMED PERSONALLY TO HAVE MY FRIEND OF 25 YEARS , BOB KERREY , ENDORSE ME WITH SUCH A VOTE OF CONFIDENCE . AS CONNIE SAID , BOB HAS GIVEN A LIFETIME OF SERVICE TO OUR COUNTRY . HE HAS LITERALLY BEEN ON THE FRONT LINES FIGHTING AND STANDING UP AND ADVOCATING FOR THE VALUES THAT WE BELIEVE ARE REALLY AT THE ROOT OF THE AMERICAN DREAM AND THIS GREAT COUNTRY'S JOURNEY TOWARD PROGRESS . I ALSO WANT TO ADD , IN ADDITION TO EVERYTHING ELSE THAT HE HAS DONE , HE SERVED WITH GREAT DISTINCTION ON THE 9/11 COMMISSION . THAT WAS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT TO THOSE OF US IN NEW YORK . HE TRIED TO GET TO THE TRUTH ; HE TRIED TO HOLD PEOPLE AND INSTITUTIONS ACCOUNTABLE . BOB AND I HAVE TALKED AT LENGTH ABOUT WHAT WE NEED TO DO IN AMERICA TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFE , TO DETER AND DEFEAT TERRORISM AND TO MAKE OUR INTELLIGENCE SERVICES AS EFFECTIVE AS POSSIBLE . BOB KERREY IS THE EMBODIMENT OF PATRIOTISM IN ACTION . AND IT IS A TREMENDOUS PRIVILEGE FOR ME TO BE HERE WITH HIM BACK ACROSS THE RIVER FROM NEBRASKA WHERE HE SERVED WITH DISTINCTION AS HE SETS FORTH THE REASONS FOR HIS SUPPORT OF MY CANDIDACY . HE KNOWS SOMETHING ABOUT COURAGE AND LEADERSHIP . HE'S GOT SOME EXPERIENCE IN TOUGH FIGHTS , SO I AM THRILLED TO HAVE HIM ON MY TEAM . THANK YOU SO VERY MUCH BOB . WE ARE KICKING OFF TODAY OUR "EVERY COUNTY COUNTS " TOUR RIGHT HERE IN COUNCIL BLUFFS . OVER THE NEXT FIVE DAYS , I AND MY FRIENDS AND SUPPORTERS WILL BLANKET IOWA . WE'RE GOING TO BE IN ALL 99 COUNTIES . WE'RE GOING TO BE KNOCKING ON DOORS AND MAKING PHONE CALLS , VISITING PEOPLE'S HOMES , THEIR PLACES OF WORK , ALL WITH A VERY SIMPLE BUT URGENT MESSAGE - THE ROAD TO THE WHITE HOUSE FOR THE NEXT PRESIDENT BEGINS HERE IN IOWA . IOWANS HAVE AN AWESOME RESPONSIBILITY , ESPECIALLY THIS YEAR . BECAUSE WE HAVE TO MAKE A DECISION THAT WILL NOT ONLY HELP US FIGURE OUT WHO WILL BE THE NEXT DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE , THAT'S IMPORTANT , BUT EVEN MORE SO , WHO IS READY TO BE PRESIDENT AND WHO IS READY , WILLING , AND ABLE ON DAY ONE TO DO THE JOB THAT WE NEED DONE . SO I'M EXCITED ABOUT OUR 99-COUNTY BLITZ . I'M ACTUALLY EVEN GOING TO GET IN A UNKNOWNWORD AFTER I LEAVE YOU . WE'RE CALLING IT A "HILL-A-COPTER ," AND WE'RE GOING TO BE ABLE TO COVER MORE GROUND THAT WAY . BUT I HAVE FRIENDS OF A LIFETIME WHO HAVE COME TO IOWA TO HELP ME , INCLUDING MY BEST FRIEND FROM ELEMENTARY SCHOOL WITH WHOM I AM STILL VERY CLOSE , PEOPLE I HAVE WORKED WITH IN ARKANSAS , NEW YORK , ACROSS THE COUNTRY , AND I AM THRILLED TO INTRODUCE THEM TO IOWA AND TO HAVE SO MANY IOWANS HEAR THEIR STORIES ABOUT WHY THEY WOULD TAKE TIME FROM THEIR BUSY LIVES TO COME HERE ON MY BEHALF . I WAS ESPECIALLY HONORED BY THE ENDORSEMENT THIS MORNING OF MY CANDIDACY BY THE DES MOINES REGISTER . IT WAS AN IMPORTANT EVENT IN THIS PROCESS . I AM VERY GRATEFUL THAT THEY HAVE ZEROED IN ON THE WORK THAT NEEDS TO BE DONE BY THE NEXT PRESIDENT , BY MY VISION FOR OUR COUNTRY , MY PLANS FOR CHANGE , AND MY ABILITY TO LEAD . NOW WITH BOB UNKNOWNWORD ENDORSEMENT , WITH CONGRESSMAN LEONARD BOSWELL'S ENDORSEMENT OF A FEW DAYS AGO , OUR CAMPAIGN IS UNKNOWNWORD , WE'RE PICKING UP MOMENTUM , AND WE'RE GOING ALL THE WAY TO JANUARY 3RD WITH YOUR HELP . I CAN FEEL THE EXCITEMENT GROWING AND IT REALLY SPANS ALL AGES . I WAS TALKING TO AN IOWAN ON THE PHONE AS I WAS DRIVING FROM THE AIRPORT TO COME HERE AND HE TOLD ME THAT HIS DAUGHTER IS TURNING 18 BEFORE THE CAUCUSES , THEY LIVE IN DES MOINES , AND SHE'S GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME . THEN I GOT A UNKNOWNWORD THAT A 102-YEAR OLD MAN IS ALSO GOING TO CAUCUS FOR ME . WE ARE APPEALING TO EVERY GENERATION . AND THAT'S THE WAY IT SHOULD BE BECAUSE WE NEED EVERYBODY IN AMERICA COMMITTED TO THE CHANGES THAT WE HAVE TO MAKE TOGETHER . IT IS INSPIRING TO ME THAT PEOPLE IN THEIR UNKNOWNWORD AND NOW IN THEIR SECOND CENTURY WILL CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THE FUTURE TO SAY "YOU KNOW WHAT , NO MATTER HOW INCONVENIENT IT IS , HOW DIFFICULT IT MIGHT BE , REGARDLESS OF THE WEATHER , I WANT TO BE THERE TO STAND UP FOR HILLARY CLINTON ." AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHOSE WHOLE LIVES ARE BEFORE THEM UNDERSTANDING WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THIS ELECTION . SO I COULD NOT BE MORE PUMPED UP . I AM THRILLED AT THE VAST AND GROWING SUPPORT WE HAVE ACROSS THE STATE . BUT AS BOB KERREY SAID , WE HAVE TO TRANSLATE THAT INTO ACTION ON JANUARY 3RD . AND I WANT TO MAKE TO YOU A CASE FOR MY CANDIDACY BECAUSE AS I ALSO AM REACHING OUT AND MEETING WITH AS MANY PEOPLE AS POSSIBLE , AND TRAVELING ALL THOSE MILES , I HAVE TO RELY ON ALL OF YOU THE WAY I RELY ON CONNIE AND KATE TO BE MY EYES , MY EARS , REALLY TO SPEAK FOR ME . AND I HOPE THAT YOU WILL IMPRESS UPON PEOPLE WHAT A CRITICAL ELECTION THIS IS . AND THAT I AM ASKING FOR YOUR SUPPORT BASED ON MY 35 YEARS OF WORK , MY UNDERSTANDING OF THE CHANGES THAT WE NEED , MY COMMITMENT TO APPLY THE PERSISTENCE , THE PERSEVERANCE , AND YES , THE PERSPIRATION TO GET IT DONE . BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND VERY WELL WHAT'S HAPPENING IN AMERICA TODAY . I GREW UP IN A MIDDLE CLASS FAMILY OUTSIDE OF CHICAGO , RIGHT HERE IN THE MIDWEST . MY FATHER CAME HOME AFTER SERVING IN THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR FIVE YEARS AND HE WANTED TO DO THREE THINGS : HE WANTED TO START A SMALL BUSINESS , HE WANTED TO START A FAMILY , AND HE WANTED TO SAVE ENOUGH MONEY TO BUY A HOUSE . MY MOTHER , WHO DIDN'T HAVE A VERY EASY UPBRINGING , SHE WANTED TO GIVE HER CHILDREN SHE NEVER HAD A CHANCE TO DO AND THAT WAS TO GO TO COLLEGE . SO WE LIVED THE MIDDLE CLASS VALUES . WE UNDERSTOOD , AS MY PARENTS TAUGHT ME , THAT WE HAD TO WORK HARD , BE UNKNOWNWORD , BE UNKNOWNWORD , BUT ALSO TO BE COMPASSIONATE AND CARING . TO BE PART OF THE LARGER COMMUNITY IN ORDER TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN , PARTICULARLY EVERY CHILD , A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . WELL MY UNKNOWNWORD OLD MOTHER , GOD BLESS HER , STILL LIVES WITH ME . I BROUGHT HER OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL AS SOME OF YOU MAY HAVE SEEN FROM THE MEDIA AND SHE HAD SUCH A GREAT TIME THAT SHE DECIDED SHE MIGHT DO A LITTLE MORE OF THAT IF SHE HAD ENOUGH REST IN BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD . BUT AS WE TRAVELED AROUND , IT WAS A GREAT REMINDER TO ME OF THE COMMITMENT I FEEL TO MAKING SURE THAT THOSE WHO ARE IN THE TWILIGHT OF THEIR YEARS AND THOSE WHO ARE AT THE VERY DAWN OF THEIR LIVES , ALL HAVE A CHANCE TO PURSUE THAT AMERICAN DREAM THAT HAS MEANT SO MUCH TO ALL OF US . AND SO I RUN FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I KNOW THAT THERE ARE A LOT OF FAMILIES IN AMERICA TODAY , CERTAINLY HERE IN IOWA , WHOM I'VE MET . THEY'VE BEEN KIND ENOUGH TO SHARE THEIR STORIES AND CONCERNS WITH ME , AND THEIR WORRIES THEY FEEL ANXIOUS AND INSECURE . THEY DON'T KNOW WHETHER LIFE WILL BE BETTER FOR THEIR CHILDREN AND THEIR GRANDCHILDREN . THEY ASK THEMSELVES EVERYDAY : "WHY IS IT NO ONE SEEMS TO NOTICE THAT I'M WORKING AS HARD AS I CAN AND I'M NOT GETTING AHEAD ? THAT I DON'T HAVE HEALTH CARE FOR MYSELF OR MY CHILDREN ; THAT MY JOB HAS BEEN OUTSOURCED AND I DON'T KNOW WHERE I'M SUPPOSED TO GO TO GET ANOTHER ONE ." THESE ARE THE REAL LIFE CONCERNS THAT IOWANS HAVE SHARED WITH ME OVER THE PAST ELEVEN MONTHS . I WANT TO TELL YOU THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . EVERYONE WILL BE SEEN , RESPECTED , HEARD . AND JUST AS I'M SAYING THAT EVERY COUNTY COUNTS IN MY CAMPAIGN , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT YOU'LL BE ABLE TO COUNT ON ME WHEN I AM YOUR PRESIDENT . I WILL GET UP EVERY SINGLE DAY THINKING ABOUT WHAT I COULD DO THAT DAY TO MAKE LIFE A LITTLE EASIER , TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY FAIRER , TO RESTORE SHARED PROSPERITY AND ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY , TO RESTORE OUR MORAL AUTHORITY AROUND THE WORLD AND TO GIVE AMERICANS BACK OUR PRIDE IN OUR COUNTRY THAT WE LOVE SO VERY MUCH . AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH , AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE . WE ARE READY FOR A NEW BEGINNING . NOW IT ALL COMES DOWN TO ONE QUESTION . WHO IS READY AND ABLE TO MAKE THE CHANGES WE NEED STARTING ON DAY ONE IN THE WHITE HOUSE ? AUDIENCE : YOU ARE . WELL , SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY DEMANDING IT . SOME PEOPLE BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY HOPING FOR IT . I BELIEVE YOU MAKE CHANGE BY WORKING HARD FOR IT . THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE ALL MY LIFE AND THAT IS WHAT I WILL DO FOR YOU . I KNOW THAT'S HOW YOU MAKE REAL CHANGE IN THE LIVES OF THE REAL PEOPLE THAT I KNOW AND CARE ABOUT , THAT I HAVE FOUGHT FOR FOR 35 YEARS . NOW THAT HARD WORK DEMANDS THAT YOU KNOW WHEN TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND WHEN TO FIND COMMON GROUND . IF YOU'RE TOO UNYIELDING , YOU WON'T GET ANYTHING DONE . NOT IN AMERICA ; WE'RE NOT A DICTATORSHIP . YOU HAVE TO WORK WITH OTHER PEOPLE . BUT IF YOU DON'T STAND UP AND REFUSE TO COMPROMISE ON WHAT'S IMPORTANT , THEN YOU COULD LOSE OUT THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE CHANGE . SO YOU HAVE TO KNOW HOW TO BALANCE IT ; HOW TO STAND YOUR GROUND AND HOW TO FIND COMMON GROUND . FOR 35 YEARS I HAVE BEEN A CHANGE-MAKER AND THAT IS EXACTLY WHAT I HOPE TO DO FOR ALL OF YOU AND FOR EVERY AMERICAN . NOW FOR ME THAT MEANS THAT I STARTED WHEN I GOT OUT OF LAW SCHOOL , NOT GOING TO WORK FOR A BIG CORPORATE LAW FIRM BUT GOING TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND . AND I DID THAT BECAUSE I WATCHED AND LEARNED ABOUT MY MOTHER'S LIFE . THE FACT THAT SHE HAD TO GO TO WORK AS A MOTHER'S HELPER WHEN SHE WAS 13 AND IT WAS HARD . AND I BELIEVE THAT KIDS SHOULD BE GIVEN A BETTER SHOT THAN THAT , AND THAT A LOT OF KIDS DRAW THE SHORT STRAW IN LIFE . ONE OF THE FIRST THINGS I WORKED ON WAS GOING DOOR TO DOOR , TRYING TO FIND OUT WHERE MISSING CHILDREN WERE . MISSING NOT BECAUSE SOMEBODY HAD KIDNAPPED THEM BUT MISSING BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T IN SCHOOL . BACK IN THE EARLY 1970'S YOU COULD LOOK AT UNKNOWNWORD FIGURES ABOUT THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WHO LIVED IN A PARTICULAR AREA . THEN YOU COULD LOOK AT SCHOOL ENROLLMENT FIGURES AND THERE WERE CHILDREN WHO WERE IN THE AREA WHO WEREN'T IN SCHOOL AND NOBODY COULD FIGURE OUT WHY . AND I FOUND OUT WHY . I FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND , CHILDREN WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD , CHILDREN IN WHEELCHAIRS , CHILDREN WITH OTHER KINDS OF DISABILITIES . THERE WAS NO PLACE FOR THEM IN A BEAUTIFUL SCHOOL LIKE THIS . SO I WORKED WITH MANY OTHERS TO CHANGE THE LAW , TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE FOR CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES TO GET A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND I WAS PROUD TO BE PART OF MAKING CHANGE THAT HELPED MILLIONS AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS . IN ARKANSAS I WORKED TO EXPAND RURAL HEALTH CARE INTO SOME OF THE POOREST PLACES IN THE STATE . I WORKED TO REFORM SCHOOLS SO IF YOU WERE A POOR CHILD LIVING IN A REALLY POOR AREA OF ARKANSAS YOU OFTEN WOULD GO TO A SCHOOL THAT DIDN'T HAVE PHYSICS , IT DIDN'T HAVE ADVANCED MATHEMATICS , OR CHEMISTRY , IT DIDN'T HAVE FOREIGN LANGUAGES . SO NO MATTER HOW TALENTED YOU WERE , NO MATTER HOW HARD WORKING YOU WERE WILLING TO BE , YOU WOULD NEVER BE ABLE TO COMPETE FOR A FIRST CLASS EDUCATION . SO WE CHANGED THAT . WE CHANGED THE STANDARDS . WE IMPROVED EDUCATION AND INDEPENDENT OBSERVERS SAID IT WAS ONE OF THE BEST REFORMS IN THE COUNTRY . BECAUSE , YOU SEE , I KNEW THAT TO MAKE CHANGE YOU HAD TO WORK WITH PEOPLE , TO RAISE TEACHER'S SALARIES AND TO EXPAND THE CURRICULUM , SO THOUSANDS OF ARKANSAS STUDENTS NOW HAVE AN EDUCATION THAT WAS DENIED TO PREVIOUS GENERATIONS AND I AM PROUD THAT I WAS PART OF MAKING THOSE CHANGES AS WELL . AND AS I CONTINUED TO WORK , I CHAIRED THE LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION TO MAKE SURE THAT EQUAL JUSTICE UNDER LAW WASN'T SOME CRUEL HOAX IN AMERICA . THAT IF YOU WERE POOR AND YOU HAD A LEGITIMATE LEGAL PROBLEM , YOU WOULD HAVE SOMEBODY WHO WOULD GIVE YOU YOUR DAY IN COURT . AND I WAS VERY PLEASED THAT I COULD , IN UNKNOWNWORD , WORK WITH A LOT OF VERY KNOWLEDGEABLE PEOPLE TO TRY TO BRING UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE TO OUR COUNTRY . NOW WE WERE NOT SUCCESSFUL BUT I AM VERY PROUD WE TRIED BECAUSE IT WAS THE RIGHT THING TO DO AND NOW WE ARE GOING TO GET IT DONE WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT AGAIN . I TRAVELED TO BEIJING AS FIRST LADY ON BEHALF OF ALL OF YOU , TO STAND UP FOR A VERY SIMPLE PROPOSITION - THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS AND HUMAN RIGHTS ARE WOMEN'S RIGHTS . IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT WE BELIEVE , HERE IN OUR COUNTRY , IT'S WHAT WE KNOW IS IMPORTANT FOR OUR NATIONAL SECURITY . COUNTRIES THAT DENY WOMEN THEIR RIGHTS ARE OFTEN COUNTRIES THAT WE HAVE PROBLEMS WITH , AREN'T THEY ? SO WE'VE GOT TO CONTINUE TO STAND UP FOR AMERICAN VALUES AND MAKE SURE THOSE VALUES ARE HEARD AROUND THE WORLD , AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT I WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE THE CHANGES ON BEHALF OF WOMEN THAT ARE GOOD AND RIGHT FOR WOMEN AND SMART FOR AMERICAN SECURITY . I WROTE A BOOK CALLED "IT TAKES A VILLAGE ," BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT I BELIEVE , ABOUT HOW WE CAN BUILD A BETTER COUNTRY FOR OUR CHILDREN . I WAS PLEASED TO TURN ALL OF THE PROCEEDS FROM THAT BOOK - OVER A MILLION DOLLARS - TO CHILDREN'S CHARITIES . BECAUSE IT'S NOT ONLY WHAT WE DO IN OUR GOVERNMENT THAT COUNTS , IT'S WHAT WE DO IN OUR DAILY LIVES . HOW WE SUPPORT CHARITABLE ENTERPRISES THAT ARE THERE WITH A HELPING HAND FOR PEOPLE THAT NEED IT . AND I WANT , AS PRESIDENT , TO INSPIRE MORE PHILANTHROPY , TO GET MORE AMERICANS INVOLVED IN HELPING THEIR NEIGHBORS . THERE'S MORE THAN ENOUGH WORK TO DO , AND WE WANT TO HARNESS WHAT IS REALLY THE GENIUS OF OUR COUNTRY - THE WILLINGNESS OF OUR CITIZENS TO GIVE OF THEMSELVES . WHEN WE WEREN'T SUCCESSFUL WITH HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE , I DID NOT GIVE UP . I SOMETIMES THINK YOU CAN TELL MORE ABOUT A PERSON WHEN YOU SEE WHAT THEY DO AFTER THEY DON'T SUCCEED THAN IF THEY HAVE ALREADY SUCCEEDED . BECAUSE WE WANT PEOPLE WHO PULL THEMSELVES UP , DON'T WE ? WHO GET UP AFTER BEING UNKNOWNWORD DOWN AND KEEP GOING . AND THAT IS WHAT I DID WHEN I HELPED TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND WE HAVE SEEN THAT PROGRAM OVER THE LAST 10 YEARS EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO MILLIONS OF KIDS AND NOW GEORGE BUSH HAS VETOED OUR EFFORTS TO EXPAND IT . WELL , I'LL TELL YOU , WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT , WE'RE GOING TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN CHILD . IN THE SENATE , I HAVE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE TO MAKE CHANGE . WHEN I WAS ELECTED , THE PEOPLE OF NEW YORK TOOK A CHANCE ON ME AND IT WAS A GREAT HONOR THAT THEY DID . BUT I KNEW THAT I HAD TO GO AND GET THINGS DONE . I COULDN'T JUST SAY , 'WE'LL I'VE BEEN ELECTED , THANK YOU VERY MUCH .' THAT'S NOT WHO I AM THAT'S NOT WHAT I DO . SO I IMMEDIATELY WENT TO WORK , EXPANDING ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN OUR RURAL AREAS FOR OUR FARMERS IN OUR SMALL TOWNS . WORKING ACROSS THE AISLE WITH REPUBLICANS TO GET HEALTH CARE FOR OUR NATIONAL GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS WHO DIDN'T HAVE IT . WORKING TO MAKE SURE WE HAD A NATIONAL EMERGENCY SYSTEM SO THAT WHEN YOU HIT 911 ON YOUR CELL PHONE , SOMEBODY WOULD KNOW WHERE YOU WERE . WORKING TO MAKE SURE THAT DESPITE THE DIFFERENCES WE HAVE IN PHILOSOPHY OR IDEOLOGY , THAT WE CANNOT LET PARTISANSHIP STAND IN THE WAY OF IMPROVING THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE IN OUR COUNTRY . I LOOK FORWARD TO WORKING WITH REPUBLICANS , AS WELL AS DEMOCRATS AND INDEPENDENTS , TO CREATE A NEW BEGINNING FOR AMERICA . THAT NEW BEGINNING WILL ONCE AND FOR ALL GIVE US UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE . EVERYDAY PEOPLE COME UP TO ME WITH THEIR PROBLEMS . THEY TELL ME HORROR STORIES ABOUT INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT REJECT THEIR CLAIMS , ABOUT PREMIUMS GOING UP SO FAST AND HIGH THEY CAN'T POSSIBLY KEEP INSURANCE FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES , ABOUT BEING WITHOUT INSURANCE , NOT ABLE TO AFFORD THE PRESCRIPTION DRUGS AND THE TREATMENT THAT THEIR DOCTORS SAY ARE NEEDED . I LISTEN TO SO MANY OF THESE STORIES AND IT JUST STRENGTHENS MY RESOLVE THAT WE WILL PUT TOGETHER A GREAT COALITION OF BUSINESS AND LABOR , OF DOCTORS AND NURSES AND HEALTH CARE PROFESSIONALS AND TOGETHER WE WILL TAKE ON THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES . AND WE'RE GOING TO BE SUCCESSFUL THIS TIME . THE STORIES THAT I HEAR , THE PERSONAL UNKNOWNWORD AND FRIENDS THAT I HAVE CONVINCE ME THAT NOTHING OTHER THAN HEALTH CARE FOR EVERYONE SHOULD BE THE STANDARD . WHEN I WAS WORKING ON MY HEALTH CARE PLAN THERE WERE THOSE WHO SAID "BUT THAT'S CONTROVERSIAL , THAT'S POLITICALLY RISKY , WHY DON'T YOU JUST CUT YOURSELF A LITTLE SLACK HERE . IT'S NOT GOING TO HURT TO LEAVE PEOPLE OUT - THAT'S A BETTER POLITICAL CASE TO MAKE ." I SAID "WHO SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ? WHO GETS TO CHOOSE WHO IS LEFT OUT ?" SHOULD I LEAVE OUT PEOPLE LIKE DAWN CARSTENS AND HER HUSBAND GREG FROM WEBSTER CITY ? THEY RUN THEIR OWN AUTO BODY SHOP . THEY WORK REALLY LONG HOURS EVERY SINGLE DAY BUT THEY CAN'T AFFORD INSURANCE . SHOULD I TELL THEM JUST TO ROLL THE DICE ? SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ELLEN DUFFY ? A NURSE I MET IN WATERLOO DIAGNOSED WITH BREAST CANCER . HER TREATMENTS MADE HER SO SICK SHE COULDN'T POSSIBLY CONTINUE TO WORK AND WHEN SHE FINALLY RECOVERED AND TRIED TO GO BACK TO WORK THE HOSPITAL TOLD HER SHE NO LONGER HAD A JOB , SHE LOST HER HEALTH INSURANCE . WHO SHOULD I LEAVE OUT ? I DON'T WANT TO LEAVE ANYBODY OUT . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO PUT BAND-AIDS ON THIS PROBLEM . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO SOLVE IT . AND I NEED YOUR HELP TO MAKE THAT CASE . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR OUR SENIORS . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE RETIREMENT SECURITY FOR WORKING AMERICANS . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE LONG-TERM CARE . I WILL GO AFTER THOSE INSURANCE COMPANIES THAT UNKNOWNWORD SENIORS OUT OF THEIR MONEY , SOMETIMES OUT OF THEIR LIFE SAVINGS . I WILL GO AFTER THOSE NURSING HOMES THAT ABUSE OUR SENIORS . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE HOME HEALTH AID , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE MORE DIGNIFIED AND RESPECTABLE ALTERNATIVES . I WANT TO PROVIDE A $3,000 TAX CREDIT FOR CAREGIVERS WHO DO THE HARD WORK OF CARING FOR NOT ONLY AGING FAMILY MEMBERS BUT CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES . THIS IS A LABOR OF LOVE . IT'S ONE OF THE MOST IMPORTANT JOBS ANY OF US WILL EVER DO AND I DON'T THINK PEOPLE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT . I WAS IN WINTERSET TWO WEEKS OR SO AGO AND THERE WAS A MAN THERE AND A WOMAN IN A WHEELCHAIR AND THE MAN WAS STANDING BEHIND HER WITH HIS HANDS ON THE BACK OF THE WHEELCHAIR . OCCASIONALLY HE WOULD REACH OVER AND GIVE HER A DRINK , OCCASIONALLY WIPE HER MOUTH . AND I CALLED ON HIM WHEN QUESTION TIME CAME . HE TOLD ME THAT HE AND HIS WIFE HAD BEEN MARRIED FOR 50 YEARS , THAT SHE'S HAD PARKINSON'S FOR 29 YEARS AND IT GOT INCREASINGLY MORE DIFFICULT TO CARE FOR HER , HE TRIED TO GET LONG-TERM CARE INSURANCE , NOBODY WOULD HELP HIM WITH HIS WIFE . ALL HE'S LOOKING FOR IS A LITTLE BIT OF HELP . HE WANTS TO TAKE CARE OF HER , THEY'VE BEEN TOGETHER A REALLY LONG TIME . BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD IF HE DOESN'T GET HELP AT ALL . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE HELP TO LOVING FAMILY MEMBERS LIKE HIM AND SO MANY OTHERS WHO ARE DOING THE RIGHT THING . WE'RE ALSO GOING TO GET A NEW BEGINNING ON ENERGY INDEPENDENCE AND COMBATING GLOBAL WARMING . THIS IS A SECURITY ISSUE . WE CANNOT CONTINUE TO BE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL . THIS IS THE MOST IMPORTANT ENVIRONMENTAL ISSUE . AREN'T YOU PROUD OF AL GORE GETTING THE NOBEL PEACE UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS WORK ON GLOBAL WARMING ? WELL , WE NEED TO TRANSLATE THAT INCREDIBLE COMMITMENT THAT HE AND MANY OTHERS HAVE MADE TO ACTION . SO I HAVE A PLAN TO DO THAT , TO MOVE TOWARD HOMEGROWN ENERGY JUST LIKE WE'RE DOING HERE IN IOWA WITH BIOFUELS AND WIND , PROMOTE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENCY . I WANT TO APPLAUD THE DEMOCRATIC CONGRESS . WE'VE RAISED GAS MILEAGE STANDARDS FOR THE FIRST TIME IN DECADES . SO THERE'S ENOUGH WORK FOR US TO DO TO PROTECT OUR PLANET , TO PROTECT OUR ECONOMY AND TO PROTECT OUR SECURITY . AND YOU KNOW WHAT THE GOOD NEWS IS ? IF WE DO THIS WE'LL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW GOOD JOBS RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS OUR COUNTRY . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING FOR OUR ECONOMY . WE'RE GOING TO REBUILD OUR GREAT AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS . WE'RE GOING TO SUPPORT OUR UNIONS . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE PEOPLE THE RIGHT TO ORGANIZE AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE TAX CUTS TO THE PEOPLE WHO NEED THEM , NOT THE PEOPLE WHO DON'T . AND WE'RE GOING TO CHANGE OUR TAX UNKNOWNWORD SO WE DON'T GIVE INCENTIVES TO THOSE WHO OUTSOURCE JOBS AND WE'RE FINALLY GOING TO MOVE TOWARD TRADE AGREEMENTS THAT DO HAVE LABOR AND ENVIRONMENTAL STANDARDS SO IT'S NOT A RACE TO THE BOTTOM BUT A REAL MOVE OF LIFT TO THE TOP . WE'RE GOING TO MOVE BACK TO FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY , SOMETHING THAT BOB KERREY WHEN HE WAS SENATOR HAD AN INSTRUMENTAL ROLE IN MAKING POSSIBLE . AND LOOK AT WHAT HAS HAPPENED . UNDER THIS PRESIDENT , ALL OF THAT HARD WORK HAS BEEN SQUANDERED . WELL WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO RECLAIMING OUR FUTURE BY STOPPING THE MORTGAGING OF OUR COUNTRY AND HAVING US BORROW BILLIONS AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND MEXICO AND EVERY PLACE IN BETWEEN . AND WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING ON EDUCATION . WE'RE GOING TO PROVIDE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION , SOMETHING THAT CONNIE HAS WORKED ON HER ENTIRE PROFESSIONAL LIFE . WE NEED TO BUILD STRONGER FAMILIES . WE NEED TO HAVE MORE EARLY INTERVENTION . WE NEED TO HELP PARENTS KNOW WHAT THEY NEED TO DO IN ORDER TO HELP THEIR OWN CHILDREN . THIS IS SOMETHING I HAVE WORKED ON FOR DECADES . I BROUGHT A PROGRAM TO ARKANSAS , THE HOME INSTRUCTION FOR PRESCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM , THAT GAVE PARENTS THE TOOLS THEY NEEDED TO HELP THEIR OWN CHILDREN . BECAUSE THAT'S THE BEST WAY FOR US TO REALLY MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN A CHILD'S LIFE . AND THEN WE'LL HAVE A UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAM THAT REACHES THOSE KIDS PARTICULARLY WHO ARE DISADVANTAGED TO GIVE THEM EVEN MORE HELP AND SUPPORT . AND WE'RE GOING TO END THE UNFUNDED MANDATE KNOWN AS NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND . AND I HAVE PLEDGED TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE AGAIN FOR EVERY YOUNG PERSON WHO GOES AND IS MOTIVATED . WE'RE NOT GOING TO FORGET THOSE YOUNG PEOPLE WHO DON'T GO TO COLLEGE . HOW ABOUT MORE JOB TRAINING ? MORE APPRENTICESHIP PROGRAMS ? LET'S GIVE THEM THE KIND OF HELP THAT THEY DESERVE TO HAVE FOR A GOOD JOB AND A GOOD FUTURE . WE'LL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING IN REFORMING OUR GOVERNMENT . I'M GOING TO END THE CRONYISM AND THE NO-BID CONTRACTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE GOING TO END THE KIND OF WAR ON SCIENCE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS WAGED . IT'S TIME WE START ACTUALLY INVESTING IN SCIENCE AGAIN . SO HOW ABOUT LIFTING THE BAN ON STEM CELL RESEARCH ? AND HOW ABOUT MAKING AMERICA THE INNOVATION NATION AGAIN ? WE CAN CREATE SO MUCH IF WE HAVE A PARTNERSHIP BETWEEN LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE PUBLIC AND THE PRIVATE SYSTEM . AND I HAVE THE IDEA I'VE BEEN PROMOTING ALL ACROSS IOWA . HOW ABOUT APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO THE GOVERNMENT AGAIN AFTER THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION ? FINALLY WE WILL MAKE A NEW BEGINNING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . IT WILL START WITH ENDING THE WAR IN IRAQ AND BRINGING OUR TROOPS HOME AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL BE A VERY SIMPLE MESSAGE THAT GOES OUT ACROSS THE WORLD - THE ERA OF COWBOY DIPLOMACY IS OVER . WE'RE GOING TO START WORKING WITH PEOPLE AGAIN . BUT I CAN'T DO ANY OF THIS WITHOUT YOU . I'M GOING TO WORK AS HARD AS I CAN TO EARN YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR TRUST . AND I NEED EVERY ONE WHO IS READY FOR CHANGE TO GO TO THE CAUCUSES ON JANUARY 3RD . IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE , YOU'RE TIRED OF PAYING THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR YOUR GAS EVERY TIME YOU TRY TO FILL UP YOUR CAR OR YOUR TRUCK , YOU'RE TIRED OF SEEING THE ECONOMY TILT MORE AND MORE TOWARD THE ALREADY WEALTHY AND PRIVILEGED - IF YOU THINK IT IS TIME TO MAKE SURE WE HAVE NO INVISIBLE AMERICANS , THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME . IF YOU CAN'T BEAR TO SEE OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN , OUR SONS AND OUR DAUGHTERS , CONTINUING TO FIGHT ANOTHER COUNTRY'S CIVIL WAR , IF YOU BELIEVE THAT THE BEST WAY TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS IS TO BRING THEM HOME - BUT YOU WANT TO BE SURE IT'S DONE THE RIGHT WAY - THEN I NEED YOU TO STAND AND CAUCUS FOR ME . IF YOU WANT TO GET OUR COUNTRY BACK INTO THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS , IF YOU BELIEVE OUR FUTURE CAN BE BETTER THAN OUR PRESENT OR OUR PAST , IF YOU WANT TO FEEL THAT PRIDE AGAIN IN AMERICA , THEN I NEED YOU TO GO STAND UP AND CAUCUS FOR ME . BECAUSE IF YOU WILL GO AND DO THAT ON JANUARY 3RD , I PROMISE YOU I WILL STAND AND WAGE A WINNING CAMPAIGN FOR OUR VALUES AND OUR PRINCIPLES AND THEN WHEN I AM ELECTED , I WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR EACH AND EVERY ONE OF YOU EVERY SINGLE DAY . LET'S MAKE HISTORY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH . IT IS A REAL PLEASURE TO BE HERE AND I APPRECIATE THOSE KIND WORDS . IT'S WONDERFUL BEING BACK IN THE CITY - AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO COME HERE AGAIN , I BELIEVE FOR THE FOURTH TIME , AND TO HAVE A CHANCE TO SPEAK WITH YOU ABOUT AN ISSUE THAT IS ON THE MINDS OF EVERYONE , WHETHER I'M HERE IN NEW YORK OR IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , OR IN IOWA OR ANY OF THE OTHER PLACES I'VE BEEN TRAVELING TO LATELY . IT'S A TOPIC OF CONVERSATION THAT HAS TO BE PUT AT THE TOP OF OUR NATION'S AGENDA . NOW WE KNOW THAT NOT FAR FROM HERE WALL STREET IS HUMMING . THE PHONES ARE RINGING , THE BLACKBERRIES ARE BUZZING . AND PEOPLE ARE MAKING BILLIONS OF TRANSACTIONS THAT RAISE CAPITAL FOR CORPORATIONS AND DELIVER VALUE TO SHAREHOLDERS EVERY DAY . AND WHAT HAPPENS ON WALL STREET TODAY - LIKE EVERY DAY - WILL RIPPLE ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THE WORLD . I'M PROUD TO REPRESENT NEW YORK , TO REPRESENT THE FINANCIAL CAPITAL OF THE WORLD . I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO I RECOGNIZE IN THIS AUDIENCE THAT ARE INTEGRAL TO WHAT HAPPENS IN OUR MARKETS , HOW WE CREATE WEALTH , HOW WE PROVIDE A DYNAMIC ECONOMY THAT WILL HOLD OUT THE PROMISE OF A BETTER LIFE FOR SO MANY OF OUR FELLOW CITIZENS , BUT INDEED FOR PEOPLE FAR FLUNG FROM HERE . I DO WANT TO RECOGNIZE SPEAKER SILVER , UNKNOWNWORD SILVER , THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR BEING HERE WITH ME . AND WE IN NEW YORK , PROBABLY MORE THAN ANYONE ANYWHERE , KNOW HOW CRITICALLY IMPORTANT IS IT FOR OUR ECONOMY AND FOR THE GLOBAL ECONOMY , THAT WALL STREET STAY ON THE CUTTING EDGE OF FINANCE AND REMAIN WHAT IT ALWAYS HAS BEEN , THE GLOBAL FINANCE CAPITAL OF THE WORLD . BUT WE KNOW THAT THE STANDARD FOR ANY ECONOMIC SYSTEM IS NOT JUST THAT IT CREATES GROWTH , BUT THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD UP FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA WHO WORK HARD AND DREAM BIG EVERY DAY . AS WE'VE SEEN THE HOME FORECLOSURE CRISIS THESE PAST FEW YEARS BUILD , THE RIPPLES FROM WALL STREET WE KNOW , CAN HAVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FAMILIES FAR AWAY IN UNKNOWNWORD , NEVADA , WHERE I RECENTLY WAS AND OTHER PLACES THAT MIGHT NEVER GIVE MUCH OF A THOUGHT TO WHAT GOES ON HERE , BUT WHOSE DAILY LIVES WILL BE IMPACTED . AS WE'VE SEEN WITH THE HOME FORECLOSURE CRISIS , TOO MANY AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE NOT SHARING IN THE GROWTH THAT IS CREATED AND DRIVEN FROM THIS CITY . NOW , PRODUCTIVITY HAS RISEN 18 PERCENT AMONG AMERICAN WORKERS OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS , YET WAGES HAVE STAYED FLAT , AND FAMILY INCOMES HAVE FALLEN BY NEARLY $1,000 . THERE ARE FIVE MILLION MORE PEOPLE IN POVERTY HERE IN OUR COUNTRY THAN THERE WERE IN 2000 . ON TOP OF STAGNANT WAGES , WE'VE SEEN A RISE IN ECONOMIC ANXIETY . STUDENTS STRUGGLING WITH THE SKYROCKETING COST OF COLLEGE , FAMILIES UNKNOWNWORD BY HEALTH CARE COSTS , PREMIUMS HAVE DOUBLED IN THE LAST SIX YEARS , AND WE SEE THE INCREASING ROLE THAT ENERGY PRICES PLAY IN PEOPLE'S LIVES . GAS PRICES HAVE DOUBLED IN THE PAST SEVEN YEARS . HOME HEATING COSTS CONTINUE TO RISE . IN FACT , THE TYPICAL FAMILY IS PAYING $2,000 MORE FOR ENERGY THIS YEAR THAN IN 2000 . THAT'S LIKE A $2,000 ENERGY TAX - MORE THAN 3 TIMES WHAT THE TYPICAL FAMILY GOT UNDER THE BUSH TAX CUTS . WE'VE SEEN PEOPLE HIT HARD BY A DEEPENING HOUSING CRISIS . FAMILIES WHO'VE WORKED HARD , THOUGHT THEY WERE DOING THE RIGHT THING . WHO'VE SPENT YEARS SCRIMPING AND SAVING TO BUY A HOUSE , BUT THEIR DREAM OF UNKNOWNWORD HAS TURNED INTO A NIGHTMARE OF ESCALATING PAYMENTS AND THREATENING LETTERS . IN SHORT , WE'VE SEEN TOO MANY MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES STRUGGLING IN AN ECONOMY THAT IS SIMPLY NOT WORKING FOR THEM RIGHT NOW . AN ECONOMY THAT , IN RECENT MONTHS , HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASINGLY WORRISOME HEADLINES ABOUT WEAKENING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE , ABOUT A DECLINING DOLLAR AND BALLOONING NATIONAL DEBT . NOW THESE ECONOMIC PROBLEMS ARE CERTAINLY NOT ALL WALL UNKNOWNWORD FAULT - NOT BY A LONG SHOT . BUT THE REALITY OF OUR INTERCONNECTED ECONOMY IS THAT WHAT HAPPENS ON WALL STREET IMPACTS MAIN STREETS ACROSS AMERICA . IT HAPPENS SOMETIMES WITHIN MINUTES , SOMETIMES OVER THE COURSE OF MONTHS OR EVEN YEARS . IF WE'RE HONEST , WE NEED TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT WALL STREET HAS PLAYED A SIGNIFICANT ROLE IN THE CURRENT PROBLEMS , AND IN PARTICULAR IN THE HOUSING CRISIS . A UNKNOWNWORD NO EVIL " POLICY THAT FINANCED IRRESPONSIBLE MORTGAGE LENDING . A BOND RATING SYSTEM RIDDLED WITH CONFLICTS OF INTEREST . A HABIT OF ISSUING COMPLEX AND OPAQUE SECURITIES THAT EVEN WALL STREET ITSELF DOESN'T SEEM TO UNDERSTAND . I BELIEVE WE NEED A NEW BEGINNING IN OUR ECONOMIC POLICY - ONE THAT STRENGTHENS OUR MIDDLE CLASS AND ENSURES THAT PROSPERITY IS WIDELY SHARED , AND IS BASED ON AN ETHIC OF SHARED RESPONSIBILITY . A NEW BEGINNING THAT MAKES WALL STREET SHOULDER ITS RESPONSIBILITY FOR THIS CRISIS , AND THAT GIVES HOMEOWNERS THE BREATHING ROOM THEY NEED . ONE THAT MAKES THE MOST WELL-OFF AMONG US PAY OUR FAIR SHARE AND GIVES THE MIDDLE CLASS THE HELP IT NEEDS FOR EDUCATION , HEALTH CARE , AND RETIREMENT SECURITY . OUR ECONOMY HAS BEEN AT RISK BY INVESTMENT SCHEMES AIMED AT MAKING NOT JUST A FEW , BUT MANY EXTRA DOLLARS , AND WE NEED TO START INSISTING ON THE RIGHT RULES AND TRANSPARENCY SO THIS DOESN'T HAPPEN AGAIN . SO I'M HERE TODAY TO CALL ON WALL STREET TO DO ITS PART - TO HELP END THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS THAT IS DEVASTATING MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND THREATENING THE HEALTH OF OUR ECONOMY . WALL STREET NEEDS TO BE PART OF A COMPREHENSIVE SOLUTION THAT BRINGS TO THE TABLE ALL THOSE RESPONSIBLE AND CALLS ON THEM TO DO THEIR PART . WALL STREET HELPED CREATE THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS , AND WALL STREET NEEDS TO HELP US SOLVE IT . LET'S START WITH AN HONEST , CLEAR-EYED ASSESSMENT OF WHAT WENT SO TERRIBLY WRONG . OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , AS INCOMES FELL AND WAGES STAGNATED , MANY FAMILIES WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO RISKY MORTGAGES WITH RATES THAT LATER JUMPED BEYOND WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD . NOW , WE CAN DEBATE WHAT WAS TECHNICALLY ILLEGAL ; WE CAN DEBATE WHAT SHOULD BE DEFINED AS PREDATORY . BUT THERE IS NO DEBATE THAT WHAT HAPPENED DID NOT REFLECT THE BEST OF OUR FINANCIAL SYSTEM . IT DID NOT REFLECT UNKNOWNWORD , TRANSPARENCY , OR EVEN AN UNDERSTANDING THAT BEHIND LARGE BUNDLES OF SECURITIZED MORTGAGES ARE REAL FAMILIES WHO WERE LED INTO BAD SITUATIONS BY PEOPLE WHO SHOULD HAVE , AND EVEN DID , KNOW BETTER . AS A RESULT , 1'8 MILLION FORECLOSURE NOTICES HAVE GONE OUT THIS YEAR , AN INCREASE OF 74 PERCENT FROM LAST YEAR . AND THE WORST MAY BE YET TO COME . THE RATES ON 2 MILLION MORTGAGES ARE SET TO UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE NEXT TWO YEARS . MEANWHILE , THERE'S BEEN AN UNPRECEDENTED NATIONAL DECLINE IN HOME VALUES . MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD TO REFINANCE THEIR LOANS , AND IT'S GOTTEN A LOT HARDER TO SELL THEIR HOMES . MANY FAMILIES ARE FINDING THEMSELVES TRAPPED - STUCK WITH MORTGAGES THEY CAN'T PAY AND EXPENSES THEY CAN'T MEET . SO THEY'RE FACING WRENCHING CHOICES : PAY THEIR MEDICAL BILLS - OR PAY THEIR MORTGAGE . PUT OFF RETIREMENT - OR LOSE THEIR HOMES . AND MANY PEOPLE WHO WORKED S HARD AND DID TRY TO FOLLOW THE RULES ARE RECEIVING THAT SAME GRIM LETTER IN THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT SAYS "GET OUT NOW ." I MET A WOMAN IN UNKNOWNWORD , NEW HAMPSHIRE - A STAY-AT-HOME MOM WITH THREE CHILDREN - WHOSE HUSBAND LOST HIS GOOD-PAYING JOB . HE WAS IN THE COMPUTER INDUSTRY . THEY KEPT MAKING THEIR LOAN PAYMENTS FOR SIX MONTHS AFTER HE WAS LAID OFF , BUT JUST AT THAT TIME , THEIR INTEREST RATE BALLOONED FROM ABOUT 8 PERCENT TO ABOUT 11 PERCENT . THEY TRIED TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY , BUT THE BANK STILL FORECLOSED ON THEIR HOME . AND EVEN AFTER HER HUSBAND FOUND A NEW , HIGH-PAYING JOB WITHIN A YEAR , THEY WERE UNABLE TO MAKE THEIR BACK PAYMENTS . BASICALLY THE DOOR WAS SHUT IN THEIR FACE . WHEN I MET HER , IT WAS LITERALLY THE DAY BEFORE HER FAMILY WAS BEING FORCED OUT OF THEIR HOME WITH NOWHERE TO GO . AS THE FORECLOSURES MOUNT , THE HOUSING CRISIS IS ALSO BECOMING A MUNICIPAL CRISIS . CITIES AND TOWNS FACE THE PROSPECT OF BLIGHT , HIGHER CRIME RATES , VACANT PROPERTIES UNKNOWNWORD NEIGHBORHOODS , CUTTING TAX RECEIPTS , AND DRAGGING DOWN PROPERTY VALUES . AND I BELIEVE THE HOUSING CRISIS ALSO THREATENS THE ECONOMY AS A WHOLE . EVEN AMERICANS WHO DON'T FACE FORECLOSURES ARE FEELING THE IMPACT . 60 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL WEALTH OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES RESIDES IN THEIR HOME EQUITY . AND HOME EQUITY WITHDRAWALS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 8 PERCENT OF FAMILIES . UNKNOWNWORD INCOME IN 2005 . SO AS HOUSING PRICES DECLINE , PEOPLE HAVE LESS MONEY TO DRAW ON FOR EVERYTHING ELSE , FROM MEDICAL BILLS TO CAR PAYMENTS TO COLLEGE TUITION . WE KNOW THAT CONSUMERS ARE THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY THAT HAS BEEN TRUE FROM THE BEGINNING . IT'S BEEN ESPECIALLY TRUE IN THE LAST YEARS . AND RIGHT NOW CONSUMERS ARE HURTING . I TALKED WITH CEOS OF THE SOME OF OUR LARGE DISCOUNT UNKNOWNWORD . THEY TELL ME THAT THE AMOUNT OF MONEY BEING SPENT IS DOWN . THE NUMBER OF SHOPPING DAYS HAS DECREASED . PEOPLE COME IN THE BEGINNING OF THE MONTH WHEN THEY ACTUALLY GET PAID AND IN THE MIDDLE OF THE MONTH BUT OTHERWISE THEY'RE MUCH SCARCER AS CONSUMERS THAN THEY USED TO BE . WITH THE HOLIDAYS QUICKLY APPROACHING , A LOT OF MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES ARE FEELING THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE GLOBAL FINANCIAL MARKETS ARE ALSO SUFFERING . RISKY LOANS HAVE BEEN PACKAGED AND SOLD AROUND THE WORLD . MORTGAGE COMPANIES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD . FINANCIAL FIRMS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD LOSSES IN THE TENS OF BILLIONS , AND THERE'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR TENS OF BILLIONS MORE . CENTRAL BANKS HAVE HAD TO STEP IN TO KEEP THE SYSTEM RUNNING . AND BANKS ARE RELUCTANT TO GIVE OUT LOANS , SO COMPANIES ARE FINDING IT HARDER AND HARDER TO GET THE CAPITAL THEY NEED TO GROW AND CREATE NEW JOBS EVEN IF THEY'RE NOT IN THE HOME INDUSTRY . NOW , WHO'S EXACTLY TO BLAME FOR THE HOUSING CRISIS ? WELL , THAT'S ALWAYS A QUESTION THAT THE PRESS AND PEOPLE ASK AND I THINK THERE'S PLENTY OF BLAME TO GO AROUND . RESPONSIBILITY BELONGS TO MORTGAGE LENDERS AND BROKERS , WHO IRRESPONSIBLY LOWERED UNDERWRITING STANDARDS , PUSHED RISKY MORTGAGES , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE DETAILS IN THE FINE PRINT . RESPONSIBILITY BELONGS TO THE ADMINISTRATION AND TO REGULATORS , WHO FAILED TO PROVIDE ADEQUATE UNKNOWNWORD , AND WHO FAILED TO RESPOND TO THE CHORUS OF REPORTS THAT MILLIONS OF FAMILIES WERE BEING TAKEN ADVANTAGE OF . RESPONSIBILITY BELONGS TO THE RATING AGENCIES , WHO WOEFULLY UNDERESTIMATED THE RISKS INVOLVED IN MORTGAGE SECURITIES . AND CERTAINLY BORROWERS SHARE RESPONSIBILITY AS WELL . HOMEBUYERS WHO PAID EXTRA FEES TO AVOID DOCUMENTING THEIR INCOME SHOULD HAVE KNOWN THEY WERE GETTING IN OVER THEIR HEADS . SPECULATORS WHO WERE BUSY BUYING TWO , THREE , FOUR HOUSES TO SELL FOR A QUICK BUCK DON'T DESERVE OUR SYMPATHY . BUT FINALLY , RESPONSIBILITY ALSO BELONGS TO WALL STREET , WHICH NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD BUT OFTEN ENCOURAGED RECKLESS MORTGAGE LENDING . MORTGAGE LENDERS DIDN'T HAVE BALANCE SHEETS BIG ENOUGH TO WRITE MILLIONS OF LOANS ON THEIR OWN . SO WALL STREET ORIGINATED AND PACKAGED THE LOANS THAT COMMON SENSE WARNED MIGHT VERY WELL HAVE ENDED IN COLLAPSE AND FORECLOSURE . SOME PEOPLE MIGHT SAY WALL STREET ONLY HELPED TO UNKNOWNWORD RISK . I BELIEVE WALL STREET SHIFTED RISK AWAY FROM PEOPLE WHO KNEW WHAT WAS GOING ON ONTO THE PEOPLE WHO DID NOT . WALL STREET MAY NOT HAVE CREATED THE FORECLOSURE CRISIS , BUT WALL STREET CERTAINLY HAD A HAND IN MAKING IT WORSE . WE ALSO MUST RECOGNIZE , THOUGH , THAT GOOD THINGS HAVE HAPPENED IN THE HOUSING MARKET . HOME OWNERSHIP IS AT THE HEART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM , AND OWNERSHIP RATES ROSE TO A RECORD 69 PERCENT IN 2006 . THAT MEANS MILLIONS OF NEW STAKEHOLDERS IN THEIR COMMUNITIES . AND THE LARGEST GAINS WERE AMONG LOW-INCOME AND MINORITY FAMILIES . THE CHALLENGE FOR US IS TO PRESERVE THE BEST OF THIS SYSTEM - WHICH HAS ALLOWED PEOPLE TO OWN THEIR OWN HOMES - WHILE GETTING UNKNOWNWORD OF THE ABUSES . AND TO DO THAT , WE NEED TO LOOK AT THIS PROBLEM , AS COMPLEX AS IT IS , HONESTLY . WE ALSO NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE COMPLEXITY AND MAGNITUDE OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE BECAUSE OBVIOUSLY IT'S NOT ONLY ABOUT THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AND THE CREDIT CRUNCH , IT'S ABOUT OUR DEBT , ABOUT THE DECLINING DOLLAR , ABOUT ALL THE CHALLENGES WE FACE IN THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . I'M CONFIDENT WE CAN NAVIGATE THROUGH THIS BUT WE CAN'T DO SO ACTING LIKE UNKNOWNWORD OR IN A FIT OF DENIAL . WE HAVE TO BE WILLING TO ROLL UP OUR SLEEVES AND START DOING WHAT WE DO BETTER THAN ANYBODY IN THE WORLD AND THAT IS SOLVING PROBLEMS . EARLIER THIS WEEK , I WROTE TO TREASURY SECRETARY PAULSON URGING HIM TO FASHION AN AGREEMENT WITH THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY AND WALL STREET THAT MATCHES THE SCALE OF THE PROBLEM . I'M HEARTENED THAT THE ADMINISTRATION HAS HEEDED AN EARLIER CALL OF MINE TO CONVENE A "CRISIS CONFERENCE " OF HOUSING STAKEHOLDERS - LENDERS , INVESTORS , MORTGAGE SERVICERS , REGULATORS , UNKNOWNWORD OF HOMEOWNERS , AND OTHERS - TO CONVERT UNWORKABLE MORTGAGES INTO STABLE LOANS THAT FAMILIES CAN AFFORD . THIS IS A MOMENT FOR SHARED RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA . INVESTORS , LENDERS , AND HOMEOWNERS ALL HAVE A PART TO PLAY AND SACRIFICES TO MAKE . IF THE AGREEMENT IS INADEQUATE , OR THE TALKS FAIL OUTRIGHT , THE COST TO OUR ECONOMY WILL ONLY INCREASE . FOR THIS "CRISIS CONFERENCE " TO SUCCEED , WALL STREET MUST BE ON BOARD . WALL STREET HAS A RESPONSIBILITY FOR THE PAST AS WELL AS AN ENORMOUS STAKE IN THE FUTURE . SO TODAY , I'M CALLING ON INVESTORS WHO CONTROL THE MORTGAGES THAT NEED MODIFYING TO BE PART OF THE SOLUTION . YOU ARE AT THE END OF A LONG CHAIN OF DECISION-MAKING AND RESPONSIBILITY . BUT WITHOUT YOUR COOPERATION , A VOLUNTARY SOLUTION CAN BE OF LIMITED EFFECTIVENESS . I URGE WALL STREET AND THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY TO VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO THE FOLLOWING THREE STEPS : FIRST , WE NEED A MORATORIUM OF AT LEAST 90 DAYS ON FORECLOSURES OF SUBPRIME , UNKNOWNWORD HOMES . THE MORATORIUM WILL STOP FORECLOSURES UNTIL LENDERS AND SERVICERS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD BORROWERS AND FROZEN MORTGAGE RATES . IT WILL ALSO GIVE FINANCIAL COUNSELORS TIME TO WORK WITH FAMILIES . SECOND , WE NEED TO FREEZE THE MONTHLY RATE ON SUBPRIME ADJUSTABLE RATE MORTGAGES , WITH THE FREEZE LASTING AT LEAST FIVE YEARS UNTIL THE MORTGAGES HAVE BEEN CONVERTED INTO AFFORDABLE , FIXED-RATE LOANS . A RATE FREEZE IS CRITICAL . AN AVERAGE OF $30 BILLION IN LOANS WILL RESET EACH MONTH NEXT YEAR , AND THE AVERAGE RESET WILL INCREASE MONTHLY PAYMENTS BY 30 TO 40 PERCENT . THESE RATE RESETS ARE THE MAJOR DRIVER OF THE FORECLOSURE COSTS . THE LONG RATE-FREEZE WILL GIVE THE HOUSING MARKET TIME TO STABILIZE . IT WILL GIVE FAMILIES AN OPPORTUNITY TO REBUILD EQUITY IN THEIR HOMES . IT WILL ALSO GIVE THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY THE TIME - AND INCENTIVE - TO CONVERT MORTGAGES THAT WERE DESIGNED TO FAIL INTO LOANS THAT ACTUALLY CAN BE REPAID . THIRD , THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY MUST PROVIDE STATUS REPORTS ON THE NUMBER OF MORTGAGES IT IS MODIFYING . ACCOUNTABILITY IS ESSENTIAL . DESPITE ALL THE MEDIA COVERAGE , DESPITE ALL THE HEARINGS , DESPITE THE SECRETARY OF THE TREASURY , DESPITE ALL THAT HAS GONE ON IN THE LAST 30 TO 60 DAYS , THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY HAS ONLY MODIFIED ABOUT 1 PERCENT OF AT-RISK MORTGAGES THIS YEAR . THAT . IS SIMPLY NOT ENOUGH . NOW , I HOPE EVERYONE WILL VOLUNTARILY AGREE TO THESE STEPS , BECAUSE WE CANNOT FAIL AT THIS . THE COSTS ARE JUST TOO HIGH . IF WE CANNOT REACH A VOLUNTARY AGREEMENT , I WILL CONSIDER LEGISLATION TO ADDRESS THE PROBLEM . MORTGAGE SERVICERS CAN WORK WITH BORROWERS TO MODIFY THEIR MORTGAGES . IN THE PROCESS , THEY CAN SAVE FAMILIES THEIR HOMES , SAVE INVESTORS FROM LOSSES DOWN THE ROAD , AND HELP THE ECONOMY . BUT THIS IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THEM , AND MANY ARE WORRIED ABOUT OPENING THEMSELVES UP TO LAWSUITS FROM THE INVESTORS WHO ACTUALLY OWN THE LOANS . I'M PREPARED TO CONSIDER GIVING LEGAL PROTECTION TO SERVICERS AND OTHERS WHO ADMINISTER THESE LOANS AND WHO DO THE RIGHT THING BY BALANCING THE INTERESTS OF HOMEOWNERS , THE INVESTORS , AND OUR ECONOMY . ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS BUILD ON THE WORK I'VE DONE THROUGHOUT THIS YEAR TO URGE IMMEDIATE ACTION ON PROBLEMS REGARDING HOUSING . I'VE CALLED ON THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY TO OBSERVE A "FORECLOSURE TIMEOUT ." I'VE PUT FORWARD A PLAN TO CRACK DOWN ON UNSCRUPULOUS MORTGAGE BROKERS , TO END LENDING ABUSES , AND EXPAND THE FINANCIAL COUNSELING PROGRAMS THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE DEFAULTS AND FORECLOSURES . I'VE PROPOSED THAT WE ALLOW THE STATE HOUSING FINANCE AGENCIES TO ISSUE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO HELP FAMILIES REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES . ON MONDAY , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION SAID IT WILL GIVE THIS IDEA A TRY , AND I'M PLEASED TO HEAR THAT . BUT I WISH UNKNOWNWORD DONE IT WHEN I PROPOSED IT TWO MONTHS - AND MORE THAN 225,000 FORECLOSURE NOTICES AGO . WHILE WE WORK TO SOLVE THE IMMEDIATE HOUSING PROBLEM , I AM ALSO CALLING ON THE ADMINISTRATION , THE REGULATORS , AND THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY TO ENSURE THAT THE ABUSES OF RECENT YEARS DON'T HAPPEN AGAIN . WE NEED AN UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT TO UNKNOWNWORD UNDERWRITING STANDARDS AND DISCLOSURE OBLIGATIONS . WE NEED TO VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST ABUSIVE LENDING PRACTICES . AND WE NEED TO ELIMINATE PREPAYMENT PENALTIES . THIS HAS BEEN ONE OF THE MOST HEART BREAKING ELEMENTS OF THIS CRISIS . I DID AN EVENT ABOUT THIS DOWN IN ORLANDO , FLORIDA EARLY LAST UNKNOWNWORD TALKING WITH A LOT OF HOMEOWNERS WHO HAD GOTTEN INTO SUB-PRIME MORTGAGES . THEY FIT THE PROFILE - MANY WERE FIRST TIME HOMEOWNERS . ONE GOT IN TROUBLE BECAUSE HE THOUGHT HE WAS DOING THE RIGHT THING . HIS FAMILY AND EVERYONE TOLD HIM , "WELL AS MUCH MONEY AS YOU CAN SAVE , PAY OFF THE LOAN AS FAST AS POSSIBLE ." SO HE BEGAN PUTTING MORE AND MORE MONEY ASIDE TO BEGIN PAYING OVER WHAT HIS MORTGAGE PAYMENT WAS ONLY TO FIND OUT HE HAD TRIGGERED THE PREPAYMENT PENALTIES AND FOUND HIMSELF WITH AN INCREASING INTEREST RATE THAT FORCED HIM INTO FORECLOSURE . WE OBVIOUSLY NEED TO CLEAN UP THE STANDARDS AND MAKE ALL OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MUCH MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO EVERYONE BUT WE DO NEED TO PROSECUTE MORTGAGE SERVICING FRAUD AND FORECLOSURE RESCUE FRAUD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD EXTENT OF THE LAW . AND WE CERTAINLY NEED TO EXPAND FINANCIAL COUNSELING FOR HOMEOWNERS AND BUYERS . WHAT I'M PROPOSING IS A COMPREHENSIVE "WORK OUT " - NOT A "BAIL OUT " - OF OUR MOST PRESSING ECONOMIC PROBLEM . AND I DO HOPE THAT MANY OF YOU HERE AND A LOT OF OUR LEADERS ON WALL STREET WILL JOIN WITH ME AND OTHERS IN HELPING TO FIND THESE SOLUTIONS . I WAS PLEASED THAT MAYOR BLOOMBERG ANNOUNCED TODAY A FUND THAT WILL BE A NON-PROFIT FUND ALONG THE LINES THAT I'VE BEEN ADVOCATING TO HELP HOMEOWNERS HERE IN THE CITY FACING FORECLOSURE . BECAUSE ADDRESSING THIS ISSUE WITH THE RIGHT LEADERSHIP AND A COMMITMENT TO SHARED RESPONSIBILITY WILL SOLVE THE PROBLEM . BUT LET'S REMEMBER THAT ADDRESSING THE HOUSING CRISES IS ONLY ONE PIECE OF WHAT HAS TO BECOME A BROADER AGENDA FOR CREATING SHARED PROSPERITY FOR AMERICANS AGAIN . THAT'S WHY I'VE PUT FORWARD A PACKAGE OF MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS THAT WILL HELP RESTORE THE BASIC AMERICAN BARGAIN . IF YOU WORK HARD YOU CAN GET AHEAD - WITH DIGNIFIED WORK , A COLLEGE EDUCATION , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE , CHILD CARE , SAVINGS AND WEALTH UNKNOWNWORD . WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR TAX CODE TO REWARD MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES AND BY DOING SO , WE CAN GET MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF TENS OF MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO WILL SPEND IT . I ALSO WILL EXTEND MIDDLE CLASS TAX CUTS , INCLUDING THE CHILD TAX CREDIT , THE MARRIAGE PENALTY RELIEF . I WANT TO GIVE GENEROUS TAX CREDITS TO HELP FAMILIES AFFORD HEALTH CARE . MY PLAN CALLED THE AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN INCLUDES HEALTH CARE TAX CREDITS SO THAT INDIVIDUALS AND SMALL BUSINESSES WILL BE ABLE TO AFFORD HEALTH CARE THROUGH THE CONGRESSIONAL PLAN THAT I WILL OPEN UP TO EVERYONE . IT'S A REALLY GOOD PLAN . IT'S NOT GOVERNMENT MEDICINE , IT IS UNKNOWNWORD AND CONGRESS PEOPLE LOVE IT . YOU GET MORE THAN 250 CHOICES AT AN AVERAGE COST THAT IS LESS THAN WHAT YOU CAN FIND THROUGH YOUR EMPLOYER OR IN THE MARKET PLACE . UNFORTUNATELY IT IS LIMITED TO FEDERAL EMPLOYEES . BY INCREASING THE POOL DRAMATICALLY WE WILL LOWER COSTS AND BE ABLE TO DEAL WITH SOME OF THE OTHER COST DRIVERS IN THE HEALTH CARE SYSTEM . I'LL ALSO OFFER UP TO $1,000 IN MATCHING TAX CUTS TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR RETIREMENT . WE ALSO HAVE A SAVINGS CRISIS . WE HAVE THE LOWEST RATE OF SAVINGS SINCE 1929 AND COINCIDENTALLY WE HAVE THE HIGHEST INCOME INEQUALITY GAP SINCE 1929 . THAT WAS NOT A GOOD YEAR FOR AMERICA . SO I THINK WE NEED TO BE SMART ABOUT HOW WE'RE GOING TO MOVE FORWARD TOGETHER . I WANT TO EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT , INCREASE THE EDUCATION TAX CUTS . IT WAS INTERESTING AS I STARTED TRAVELING AROUND THE COUNTRY LAST WINTER . I WOULD BE IN SMALL GROUPS WITH MY SUPPORTERS AND A LOT OF MY WONDERFUL DONORS , SOME OF WHOM ARE HERE TODAY , AND I'D GO THROUGH MY LIST OF WHAT I WANTED TO DO AS PRESIDENT AND I WOULD SAY I WANTED TO INCREASE COLLEGE AFFORDABILITY AND PEOPLE WOULD NOD AND THEY WOULD BE IN OBVIOUS AGREEMENT BUT IF I SAID IT IN A GYMNASIUM IN FRONT OF UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE IN CONCORD , NH , THEY STOOD UP AND CHEERED AND KICKED THE BLEACHERS BECAUSE IT HAS BECOME SO EXPENSIVE . WE ARE SHUTTING THE DOOR ON COLLEGE FOR A LOT OF WORTHY AND MOTIVATED YOUNG PEOPLE . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD TIE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO CONGRESSIONAL SALARIES , SO THAT CONGRESS CAN'T GET A RAISE UNLESS WORKING MEN AND WOMEN DO TOO . WE HAVE TO REFORM THE ALTERNATIVE MINIMUM TAX , AND I GIVE CONGRESSMAN UNKNOWNWORD A LOT OF POINTS FOR COURAGE IN TRYING TO TAKE THIS ON BECAUSE IT WILL INCREASE THE TAX RATES ON MILLIONS OF NEW YORK TAXPAYERS AND MILLIONS OF OTHERS THROUGHOUT AMERICA JUST AT A TIME WHEN WE NEED STIMULUS SO WE'VE GOT TO DEAL WITH THE AMT . IT'S A STEALTH-TAX THAT MOST PEOPLE WERE NEVER MEANT TO PAY . BUT , THE GROWING CONCERNS IN OUR ECONOMY SHOULD PROMPT US TO CONSIDER WHETHER WORKING FAMILIES NEED MORE IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE IN THE FORM OF ECONOMIC STIMULUS . JUST LIKE THE HOUSING CRISIS , THE ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH AS UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC CONDITIONS HAVE WORSENED . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO WILL WAKE UP EVERY MORNING FOCUSED ON KEEPING OUR ECONOMY ON TRACK . AND IF WE WAKE UP TO THE CURRENT ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD , A VIGILANT PRESIDENT SHOULD BE TALKING ABOUT THE RIGHT KIND OF STIMULUS TODAY . AND BY RIGHT KIND I MEAN BROAD BASED . WE HAVE , AS MY HUSBAND AND I OFTEN SAY , CERTAINLY BENEFITED OVER THE LAST SEVEN YEARS OF THIS ADMINISTRATION AS WE'VE SEEN THE VAST MAJORITY OF AMERICANS BASICALLY STALL . SO IF WE TALK ABOUT STIMULUS LETS TALK ABOUT THE RIGHT KIND OF STIMULUS . MORE AND MORE ECONOMIC FORECASTERS AND EVEN JUST FAMILIES ACROSS AMERICA WORRY WE MAY FACE AN ECONOMIC SET OF ISSUES THAT WILL STALL GROWTH EVEN MORE , HIT MUCH HARDER ON THE INCOME AND THE ASSETS OF PEOPLE WHO ARE LIVING IN WHAT I CALL THE UNKNOWNWORD DOOR ECONOMY " RIGHT NOW - ONE PINK SLIP , ONE MISSED MORTGAGE PAYMENT , ONE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS AWAY FROM FALLING THROUGH AND LOSING EVERYTHING . THAT'S WHY I HAVE CALLED FOR UP TO $5 BILLION IN IMMEDIATE ASSISTANCE TO HELP COMMUNITIES AND DISTRESSED HOMEOWNERS WEATHER THIS FORECLOSURE CRISIS . IF WE CAN HELP STABILIZE THE PATIENT WE'LL HAVE A LOT BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING ALL OF US HEALTHY AGAIN . I'VE CALLED FOR $2 BILLION IN EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE FOR FAMILIES FACING SKYROCKETING HEATING BILLS THIS WINTER . WE NEED TO BE AGGRESSIVE IN GETTING THIS ASSISTANCE OUT FAST TO WORKING FAMILIES AND SENIORS SO THAT THEY CAN SPEND IT AND PROTECT THEMSELVES . THESE ARE UNKNOWNWORD STEPS AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD BE READY TO TAKE FURTHER STEPS IF THE SITUATION DETERIORATES . WE SHOULD DO THIS IN A WAY THAT MAKES ECONOMIC COMMON SENSE . IN 2001 , PRESIDENT BUSH USED STIMULUS AS AN EXCUSE TO FORCE THROUGH LONG-TERM TAX CUTS FOR THE MOST FORTUNATE AMONG US . THE RESULT WAS A WEAK STIMULUS THAT CONTINUED US ON A PATH TO HIGHER DEFICITS , BALLOONING DEBT , AND INCREASED BORROWING FROM FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS . THIS TIME AROUND , LET'S MAKE SURE WE GET IT RIGHT . LET'S MAKE THE STIMULUS TEMPORARY AND NOT AN EXCUSE FOR LONG-TERM FISCAL RECKLESSNESS . LET'S FOCUS ON HARD-WORKING FAMILIES . LET'S SUPPORT THEM BECAUSE THEY'RE THE MOST LIKELY TO REALLY PROVIDE WHAT THE ECONOMY DESPERATELY NEEDS - A JUMPSTART . THE ADMINISTRATION WAS ASLEEP AT THE SWITCH BUT WE CAN'T WAIT UNTIL WE HAVE A NEW PRESIDENT . WE NEED TO MAKE SURE WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO GET THIS PRESIDENT AND THIS ADMINISTRATION TO TAKE ACTION . AND WE NEED THEN TO HAVE A PRESIDENT STARTING IN JANUARY 2009 WHO IS READY TO CHANGE OUR POLICIES AND LEAD OUR COUNTRY . THAT MEANS ANTICIPATING ECONOMIC PROBLEMS THAT MAY ARISE IN THE FUTURE AND TAKING ACTION TO AMELIORATE OR ELIMINATE THEM . IT MEANS CALLING TOGETHER IMMEDIATELY THOSE WHO ARE STAKEHOLDERS AND DECISION-MAKERS . AMERICA IS AT ITS BEST WHEN WE WORK TOGETHER . WE HAVEN'T REALLY BEEN CALLED TO DO THAT IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . MANY OF US IN NEW YORK WAITED TO BE CALLED FOR SOME KIND OF COMMITMENT , SACRIFICE , RESPONSIBILITY AFTER WE WERE SO HORRIFICALLY ATTACKED ON 9/11 . THE CALL NEVER CAME . I THINK IT WAS A MISSED OPPORTUNITY OF HISTORIC PROPORTION . WHAT WE NEED ALWAYS TO BE READY TO DO IS TO RESPOND AS AMERICANS . WE NEED TO START ACTING AS OUR BEST SELVES AGAIN . WE NEED LEADERSHIP WHO WILL SUMMON US TO DO THAT . AND I'M CALLING PARTICULARLY ON THOSE WHO ARE SO ABLE AND SO SMART AND SO RESOURCEFUL TO HELP US FIND OUR WAY FORWARD HERE . DON'T WAIT FOR THE ADMINISTRATION OR SECRETARY PAULSON TO CALL . CALL YOURSELF . MAKE SURE THAT YOU'RE PART OF THIS ONGOING UNKNOWNWORD .. IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR THE ECONOMY , BUT EVEN MORE IMPORTANTLY IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO FOR AMERICA . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THIS MORNING , WE WOKE UP TO BAD NEWS FROM WALL STREET . FOR THE SECOND DAY IN A UNKNOWNWORD , THE GLOBAL STOCK MARKET HAS CONTINUED TO PLUNGE AS THE WORLD CONTINUES TO FEAR THAT THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT WON'T DO ENOUGH TO PREVENT A RECESSION . WE HOPE THAT THE RATE CUT ANNOUNCED THIS MORNING WILL RESTORE SOME CONFIDENCE AND STOP THE DAMAGE , BUT THE FEAR REMAINS . IT'S A FEAR THAT HASN'T JUST CONFINED ITSELF TO THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD WATCH THE TICKERS OR SCAN THE HEADLINES OF THE FINANCIAL SECTION , BUT ONE THAT I HAVE SEEN ON THE FACES OF WORKING AMERICANS IN EVERY CORNER OF THIS COUNTRY LONG BEFORE ANXIETY EVER HIT WALL STREET . I'VE SEEN IT IN THE FACES OF FAMILIES WHO ARE BEING FORCED TO FORECLOSE ON THEIR DREAM BECAUSE AN UNSCRUPULOUS LENDER TRICKED THEM INTO BUYING A HOME THEY COULDN'T AFFORD JUST TO POCKET A PROFIT . I'VE SEEN IT IN THE FACES OF MAYTAG WORKERS WHO LABORED ALL THEIR LIVES ONLY TO SEE THEIR JOBS SHIPPED OVERSEAS ; WHO NOW COMPETE WITH THEIR TEENAGERS FOR $7-AN-HOUR JOBS AT WAL-MART . AND I'VE SEEN IT IN THE FACE OF A YOUNG WOMAN WHO TOLD ME SHE ONLY GETS THREE HOURS OF SLEEP BECAUSE SHE WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT AFTER A FULL DAY OF COLLEGE AND STILL CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE FOR A SISTER WHO'S ILL . IN THE LAST SEVERAL MONTHS , THEIR FEARS HAVE GROWN WORSE AND ARE NOW SHARED BY MORE AND MORE AMERICANS . WHAT STARTED AS A CRISIS IN THE HOUSING MARKET HAS NOW SPILLED OVER TO THE REST OF THE ECONOMY . BANKS ARE FACING A CREDIT CRUNCH , LEAVING BUSINESSES WITH LESS MONEY TO INVEST AND MORE AMERICANS UNABLE TO GET LOANS . JOBLESSNESS ROSE MORE LAST MONTH THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE JUST AFTER 9/11 , AND OIL REACHED $100 A BARREL . PEOPLE HAVE LESS MONEY TO SPEND , HIGHER BILLS TO PAY , AND FEWER OPPORTUNITIES FOR WORK . FOR YEARS , WE WERE WARNED THIS MIGHT HAPPEN . BUT WASHINGTON DID WHAT WASHINGTON DOES - IT LOOKED THE OTHER WAY . IT REWARDED LENDERS AND LOBBYISTS WITH WHATEVER THEY ASKED FOR WHILE IGNORING THE VOICES OF WORKING PEOPLE WHO NEEDED HELP MOST . AND ALL THE WHILE , WE'VE BEEN LED BY GEORGE W . BUSH - A PRESIDENT WHO'S DONE MORE TO CONTRIBUTE TO THIS COUNTRY'S WIDENING INEQUALITY THAN ANYONE SINCE HERBERT HOOVER ; A PRESIDENT WHOSE TAX BREAKS FOR WEALTHY AMERICANS WHO DIDN'T NEED THEM AND DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM HAVE ONLY ENCOURAGED THE MINDSET IN WASHINGTON AND ON WALL STREET THAT .WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD ENOUGH .. THAT'S WHY IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT AFTER MONTHS AND MONTHS OF WATCHING FAMILIES STRUGGLE TO GET BY IN THIS ECONOMY , GEORGE BUSH FINALLY OFFERED A STIMULUS PLAN LAST WEEK THAT NEGLECTS 50 MILLION WORKERS AND SENIORS WHO NEED OUR HELP THE MOST ; THE VERY PEOPLE WHO ARE MOST LIKELY TO SPEND AND GIVE OUR ECONOMY THE BOOST IT NEEDS RIGHT NOW . WELL GEORGE BUSH'S ECONOMIC PLANS HAVEN'T WORKED BEFORE AND THEY'RE NOT GOING TO START WORKING NOW . MORE IMPORTANTLY , THEY DON'T REFLECT WHO WE ARE AS AMERICANS . WE HAVEN'T COME THIS FAR BECAUSE WE PRACTICE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST . AMERICA IS AMERICA BECAUSE WE STRIVE FOR SURVIVAL OF THE NATION - A NATION WHERE NO ONE IS LEFT BEHIND AND EVERYONE HAS A CHANCE TO ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS . THAT'S WHO WE ARE . AND THAT'S WHO WE CAN BE AGAIN AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT . THIS ISN'T AN ISSUE I FOUND ALONG THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL . I INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO STOP MORTGAGE FRAUD AND PREDATORY LENDING ALMOST TWO YEARS AGO . I CALLED FOR A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT BACK IN SEPTEMBER THAT WOULD PUT MONEY INTO THE POCKETS OF OVER 90 % OF WORKING AMERICANS ; THAT WOULD ELIMINATE INCOME TAXES FOR SENIORS MAKING LESS THAN $50,000 ; THAT WOULD GIVE A TAX CREDIT TO STRUGGLING HOMEOWNERS . AND THAT'S WHY WHEN I ANNOUNCED MY ECONOMIC STIMULUS PACKAGE THE OTHER WEEK , I CALLED FOR IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES AND SENIORS - BECAUSE THEY SHOULDN'T HAVE TO WAIT ANOTHER DAY FOR WASHINGTON TO ACT . THEY NEED OUR HELP RIGHT NOW . WE SHOULD SEND EACH WORKING FAMILY A $500 TAX CUT AND EACH SENIOR A $250 SUPPLEMENT TO THEIR SOCIAL SECURITY CHECK . AND IF THE ECONOMY CONTINUES TO DECLINE IN THE COMING WEEKS , WE SHOULD DO IT AGAIN . THIS IS THE UNKNOWNWORD WAY TO HELP PEOPLE PAY THEIR BILLS AND GET THEM TO START SPENDING . WE SHOULD ALSO IMMEDIATELY MAKE UNEMPLOYMENT INSURANCE AVAILABLE FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND FOR MORE PEOPLE WHO ARE FACING JOB LOSSES , AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE IT BENEFITS PART-TIME AND UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS , SOMETHING THAT WILL PARTICULARLY HELP WOMEN , AFRICAN-AMERICANS AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE SHOULD HELP THOSE FACING FORECLOSURE REFINANCE THEIR MORTGAGES AND STAY IN THEIR HOMES , AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE DIRECT RELIEF TO VICTIMS OF MORTGAGE FRAUD . AND WE SHOULD PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO STATE AND LOCAL GOVERNMENTS SO THAT THEY DON'T SLASH CRITICAL SERVICES LIKE HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION . OF COURSE , IT'S EASY TO PROPOSE PLANS AND POLICIES WHEN YOU'RE ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL . YOU CAN MAKE ALL SORTS OF PROMISES AND TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR WHEN THEY WANT TO HEAR IT . BUT IN THIS TIME OF ECONOMIC ANXIETY AND UNCERTAINTY , WHAT THIS COUNTRY NEEDS MOST IS A PRESIDENT WHO SAYS WHAT HE MEANS AND MEANS WHAT HE SAYS ; A PRESIDENT WHO WON'T JUST DO WHAT'S RIGHT WHEN THE POLITICS ARE EASY , BUT WHEN THE POLITICS ARE HARD ; A PRESIDENT WHO'S NOT JUST IN IT TO WIN IT ; BUT IN IT FOR YOU . IN THE DEBATE LAST NIGHT , WE SPENT SOME TIME TALKING ABOUT THE ECONOMY . AND ONE OF THE THINGS I BROUGHT UP THAT CONCERNED ME WAS THAT WHEN SENATOR CLINTON FIRST RELEASED HER ECONOMIC STIMULUS PLAN , SHE DIDN'T THINK THAT WORKERS OR SENIORS NEEDED IMMEDIATE TAX RELIEF . SHE THOUGHT IT COULD WAIT UNTIL THINGS GOT WORSE . FIVE DAYS LATER , THE ECONOMY DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE , BUT THE POLITICS APPARENTLY DID , BECAUSE SHE CHANGED HER PLAN TO LOOK JUST LIKE MINE . IT REMINDS ME OF WHAT HAPPENED WHEN WE STARTED DEBATING THE CREDIT CARD INDUSTRY'S BANKRUPTCY BILL - A BILL THAT WOULD MAKE IT MUCH HARDER FOR WORKING FAMILIES TO CLIMB OUT OF DEBT . BELIEVE IT OR NOT , SENATOR CLINTON SAID AGAIN LAST NIGHT THAT EVEN THOUGH SHE VOTED FOR THE BILL , SHE WAS GLAD IT DIDN'T PASS . I KNOW YOU CAN GET AWAY WITH THIS IN WASHINGTON , BUT MOST OF US KNOW THAT IF YOU DON'T WANT TO SEE A BILL PASS , THERE'S A PRETTY EASY OPTION AVAILABLE - YOU CAN VOTE AGAINST IT . AND WE'VE HEARD HER SAY THE SAME KIND OF THING ABOUT NAFTA AND CHINA TRADE -AGREEMENTS THAT SENT MILLIONS OF AMERICAN JOBS - THOUSANDS FROM THIS VERY STATE - OVERSEAS . BECAUSE ONLY IN WASHINGTON COULD SENATOR CLINTON SAY THAT NAFTA LED TO ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD UP UNTIL SHE STARTED RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT . NOW SHE SAYS WE NEED A TIME-OUT ON TRADE . NO ONE KNOWS WHEN THIS TIME-OUT WILL END . MAYBE AFTER THE ELECTION . THE POINT IS - THIS IS EXACTLY THE KIND OF POLITICS WE CAN'T AFFORD RIGHT NOW . NOT WHEN THE STAKES ARE THIS HIGH . NOT WHEN THE ECONOMY IS THIS FRAGILE . NOT WHEN SO MANY BANKS ARE UNKNOWNWORD ON PEOPLE'S DREAMS . WE CAN'T AFFORD A PRESIDENT WHOSE POSITIONS CHANGE WITH THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT , WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS THAT BEING READY ON DAY ONE MEANS GETTING IT RIGHT FROM DAY ONE . AND SOUTH CAROLINA , IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE , THAT'S THE KIND OF PRESIDENT I'LL BE . IN MY TWENTY-FIVE YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE , MY POSITIONS HAVEN'T CHANGED WHEN THE POLITICS GOT HARD , AND NEITHER WILL THE POLICIES I PURSUE AS PRESIDENT . I STARTED MY CAREER AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO , FIGHTING JOBLESSNESS AND POVERTY WHEN THE LOCAL STEEL PLANT CLOSED . I PROVIDED TAX RELIEF FOR WORKING FAMILIES AS A STATE SENATOR IN ILLINOIS . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , I'LL TAKE AWAY THE BREAKS THAT WASHINGTON GIVES TO COMPANIES WHO SHIP OUR JOBS OVERSEAS , AND GIVE THEM TO COMPANIES WHO CREATE THE JOBS OF THE FUTURE RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA . I WON'T WAIT TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE EVERY TEN YEARS - I WILL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE EVERY YEAR SO THAT WORKERS DON'T FALL BEHIND . I'LL TAKE ON THE CREDIT CARD COMPANIES WHO ARE PROFITING BY DRIVING WORKING FAMILIES INTO DEBT . AND I'LL MAKE SURE THAT CEOS CAN'T DUMP YOUR PENSION WITH ONE HAND WHILE THEY COLLECT A UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE OTHER . THAT'S AN OUTRAGE , AND IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS IT'S AN OUTRAGE . ON HEALTH CARE , I KNOW WHAT IT TAKES TO EXPAND COVERAGE TO THE UNINSURED . IN ILLINOIS , I BROUGHT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO 150,000 CHILDREN AND PARENTS . AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , I'LL DO MORE TO CUT COSTS FOR FAMILIES AND BUSINESSES THAN ANYONE IN THIS RACE , AND I'LL PASS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE NOT TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW , NOT TEN YEARS FROM NOW , BUT BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM IN OFFICE . AND WHEN IT COMES TO TAKING AWAY THE POWER OF LOBBYISTS AND SPECIAL INTERESTS , I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO'S ACTUALLY DONE IT . IN ILLINOIS I PASSED THE FIRST MAJOR ETHICS REFORM IN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS . IN WASHINGTON I HELPED PASS THE STRONGEST LOBBYING REFORM IN A GENERATION - WE BANNED GIFTS FROM LOBBYISTS , MEALS WITH LOBBYISTS , SUBSIDIZED TRAVEL ON FANCY UNKNOWNWORD , AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN HISTORY , WE FORCED LOBBYISTS TO TELL THE AMERICAN PUBLIC WHO THEY'RE RAISING MONEY FROM AND WHO IN CONGRESS THEY'RE FUNNELING IT TO . LAST NIGHT SENATOR CLINTON DEFENDED LOBBYISTS AGAIN , WHO SHE HAS SAID REPRESENT REAL AMERICANS . WELL LET ME TELL YOU - IF YOU REALLY BELIEVE THAT LOBBYISTS REPRESENT REAL AMERICANS , THEN YOU DON'T . WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS HAVEN'T FUNDED MY CAMPAIGN , THEY WON'T RUN MY WHITE HOUSE , AND THEY WILL NOT DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF WORKING AMERICANS WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . WE KNOW THE ROAD AHEAD WILL BE DIFFICULT . NONE OF THE PROBLEMS WE FACE WILL BE EASY TO SOLVE AND CHANGE WILL NOT HAPPEN OVERNIGHT . IT WILL TAKE A NEW SPIRIT OF COOPERATION AND SACRIFICE . IT WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE RISE AND FALL AS ONE NATION ; AND THAT A COUNTRY IN WHICH ONLY A FEW PROSPER IS UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR IDEALS AND OUR DEMOCRACY . AND IT WILL TAKE A PRESIDENT WHO CAN RALLY AMERICANS OF DIFFERENT VIEWS AND BACKGROUNDS TO THIS COMMON CAUSE . I'M REMINDED EVERY DAY THAT I AM NOT A PERFECT MAN . AND I WILL NOT BE A PERFECT PRESIDENT . BUT I CAN PROMISE YOU THIS - I WILL ALWAYS SAY WHAT I MEAN AND MEAN WHAT I SAY . I WILL BE HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE . AND MOST IMPORTANTLY , I WILL WAKE UP EVERY SINGLE DAY READY TO LISTEN TO YOU , AND WORK FOR YOU , AND FIGHT FOR YOU NOT JUST WHEN IT'S EASY , BUT WHEN IT'S HARD . THAT'S WHAT I DID FOR THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO . THAT'S WHAT I'VE DONE OVER THE LAST DECADE FOR THE WORKING FAMILIES OF ILLINOIS . AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY . THANK YOU .
BLUE	THE SCRIPTURE TELLS US THAT WHEN JOSHUA AND THE ISRAELITES ARRIVED AT THE GATES OF JERICHO , THEY COULD NOT ENTER . THE WALLS OF THE CITY WERE TOO STEEP FOR ANY ONE PERSON TO CLIMB ; TOO STRONG TO BE TAKEN DOWN WITH BRUTE FORCE . AND SO THEY SAT FOR DAYS , UNABLE TO PASS ON THROUGH . BUT GOD HAD A PLAN FOR HIS PEOPLE . HE TOLD THEM TO STAND TOGETHER AND MARCH TOGETHER AROUND THE CITY , AND ON THE SEVENTH DAY HE TOLD THEM THAT WHEN THEY HEARD THE SOUND OF THE RAM'S HORN , THEY SHOULD SPEAK WITH ONE VOICE . AND AT THE CHOSEN HOUR , WHEN THE HORN UNKNOWNWORD AND A CHORUS OF VOICES CRIED OUT TOGETHER , THE MIGHTY WALLS OF JERICHO CAME TUMBLING DOWN . THERE ARE MANY LESSONS TO TAKE FROM THIS PASSAGE , JUST AS THERE ARE MANY LESSONS TO TAKE FROM THIS DAY , JUST AS THERE ARE MANY MEMORIES THAT FILL THE SPACE OF THIS CHURCH . AS I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHICH ONES WE NEED TO REMEMBER AT THIS HOUR , MY MIND WENT BACK TO THE VERY BEGINNING OF THE MODERN CIVIL RIGHTS ERA . BECAUSE BEFORE MEMPHIS AND THE MOUNTAINTOP ; BEFORE THE BRIDGE IN SELMA AND THE MARCH ON WASHINGTON ; BEFORE BIRMINGHAM AND THE BEATINGS ; THE FIRE HOSES AND THE LOSS OF THOSE FOUR LITTLE GIRLS ; BEFORE THERE WAS KING THE UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS MAGNIFICENT DREAM , THERE WAS KING THE YOUNG PREACHER AND A PEOPLE WHO FOUND THEMSELVES SUFFERING UNDER THE YOKE OF OPPRESSION . AND ON THE EVE OF THE BUS BOYCOTTS IN MONTGOMERY , AT A TIME WHEN MANY WERE STILL DOUBTFUL ABOUT THE POSSIBILITIES OF CHANGE , A TIME WHEN THOSE IN THE BLACK COMMUNITY MISTRUSTED THEMSELVES , AND AT TIMES MISTRUSTED EACH OTHER , KING INSPIRED WITH WORDS NOT OF ANGER , BUT OF AN URGENCY THAT STILL SPEAKS TO US TODAY : "UNITY IS THE GREAT NEED OF THE HOUR " IS WHAT KING SAID . UNITY IS HOW WE SHALL OVERCOME . WHAT DR . KING UNDERSTOOD IS THAT IF JUST ONE PERSON CHOSE TO WALK INSTEAD OF RIDE THE BUS , THOSE WALLS OF OPPRESSION WOULD NOT BE MOVED . BUT MAYBE IF A FEW MORE WALKED , THE FOUNDATION MIGHT START TO SHAKE . IF A FEW MORE WOMEN WERE WILLING TO DO WHAT ROSA PARKS HAD DONE , MAYBE THE CRACKS WOULD START TO SHOW . IF TEENAGERS TOOK FREEDOM RIDES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH , MAYBE A FEW BRICKS WOULD COME LOOSE . MAYBE IF WHITE FOLKS MARCHED BECAUSE THEY HAD COME TO UNDERSTAND THAT THEIR FREEDOM TOO WAS AT STAKE IN THE IMPENDING BATTLE , THE WALL WOULD BEGIN TO SWAY . AND IF ENOUGH AMERICANS WERE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE INJUSTICE ; IF THEY JOINED TOGETHER , NORTH AND SOUTH , RICH AND POOR , CHRISTIAN AND JEW , THEN PERHAPS THAT WALL WOULD COME TUMBLING DOWN , AND JUSTICE WOULD FLOW LIKE WATER , AND RIGHTEOUSNESS LIKE A MIGHTY STREAM . UNITY IS THE GREAT NEED OF THE HOUR - THE GREAT NEED OF THIS HOUR . NOT BECAUSE IT SOUNDS PLEASANT OR BECAUSE IT MAKES US FEEL GOOD , BUT BECAUSE IT'S THE ONLY WAY WE CAN OVERCOME THE ESSENTIAL DEFICIT THAT EXISTS IN THIS COUNTRY . I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A BUDGET DEFICIT . I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A TRADE DEFICIT . I'M NOT TALKING ABOUT A DEFICIT OF GOOD IDEAS OR NEW PLANS . I'M TALKING ABOUT A MORAL DEFICIT . I'M TALKING ABOUT AN EMPATHY DEFICIT . I'M TAKING ABOUT AN INABILITY TO RECOGNIZE OURSELVES IN ONE ANOTHER ; TO UNDERSTAND THAT WE ARE OUR BROTHER'S KEEPER ; WE ARE OUR SISTER'S KEEPER ; THAT , IN THE WORDS OF DR . KING , WE ARE ALL TIED TOGETHER IN A SINGLE GARMENT OF DESTINY . WE HAVE AN EMPATHY DEFICIT WHEN WE'RE STILL SENDING OUR CHILDREN DOWN CORRIDORS OF SHAME - SCHOOLS IN THE FORGOTTEN CORNERS OF AMERICA WHERE THE COLOR OF YOUR SKIN STILL AFFECTS THE CONTENT OF YOUR EDUCATION . WE HAVE A DEFICIT WHEN CEOS ARE MAKING MORE IN TEN MINUTES THAN SOME WORKERS MAKE IN TEN MONTHS ; WHEN FAMILIES LOSE THEIR HOMES SO THAT LENDERS MAKE A PROFIT ; WHEN MOTHERS CAN'T AFFORD A DOCTOR WHEN THEIR CHILDREN GET SICK . WE HAVE A DEFICIT IN THIS COUNTRY WHEN THERE IS SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE FOR SOME AND JENA JUSTICE FOR OTHERS ; WHEN OUR CHILDREN SEE NOOSES UNKNOWNWORD FROM A SCHOOLYARD TREE TODAY , IN THE PRESENT , IN THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY . WE HAVE A DEFICIT WHEN HOMELESS VETERANS SLEEP ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES ; WHEN INNOCENTS ARE SLAUGHTERED IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF DARFUR ; WHEN YOUNG AMERICANS SERVE TOUR AFTER TOUR OF DUTY IN A WAR THAT SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED AND NEVER BEEN WAGED . AND WE HAVE A DEFICIT WHEN IT TAKES A BREACH IN OUR LEVEES TO REVEAL A BREACH IN OUR COMPASSION ; WHEN IT TAKES A TERRIBLE STORM TO REVEAL THE HUNGRY THAT GOD CALLS ON US TO FEED ; THE SICK HE CALLS ON US TO CARE FOR ; THE LEAST OF THESE HE COMMANDS THAT WE TREAT AS OUR OWN . SO WE HAVE A DEFICIT TO CLOSE . WE HAVE WALLS - BARRIERS TO JUSTICE AND EQUALITY - THAT MUST COME DOWN . AND TO DO THIS , WE KNOW THAT UNITY IS THE GREAT NEED OF THIS HOUR . UNFORTUNATELY , ALL TOO OFTEN WHEN WE TALK ABOUT UNITY IN THIS COUNTRY , WE'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT IT CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE CHEAP . WE'VE COME TO BELIEVE THAT RACIAL RECONCILIATION CAN COME EASILY - THAT IT'S JUST A MATTER OF A FEW IGNORANT PEOPLE TRAPPED IN THE PREJUDICES OF THE PAST , AND THAT IF THE DEMAGOGUES AND THOSE WHO EXPLOIT OUR RACIAL DIVISIONS WILL SIMPLY GO AWAY , THEN ALL OUR PROBLEMS WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD . ALL TOO OFTEN , WE SEEK TO IGNORE THE PROFOUND INSTITUTIONAL BARRIERS THAT STAND IN THE WAY OF ENSURING OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL CHILDREN , OR DECENT JOBS FOR ALL PEOPLE , OR HEALTH CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE SICK . WE LONG FOR UNITY , BUT ARE UNWILLING TO PAY THE PRICE . BUT OF COURSE , TRUE UNITY CANNOT BE SO EASILY WON . IT STARTS WITH A CHANGE IN ATTITUDES - A BROADENING OF OUR MINDS , AND A BROADENING OF OUR HEARTS . IT'S NOT EASY TO STAND IN SOMEBODY ELSE'S SHOES . IT'S NOT EASY TO SEE PAST OUR DIFFERENCES . WE'VE ALL ENCOUNTERED THIS IN OUR OWN LIVES . BUT WHAT MAKES IT EVEN MORE DIFFICULT IS THAT WE HAVE A POLITICS IN THIS COUNTRY THAT SEEKS TO DRIVE US UNKNOWNWORD - THAT PUTS UP WALLS BETWEEN US . WE ARE TOLD THAT THOSE WHO DIFFER FROM US ON A FEW THINGS ARE DIFFERENT FROM US ON ALL THINGS ; THAT OUR PROBLEMS ARE THE FAULT OF THOSE WHO DON'T THINK LIKE US OR LOOK LIKE US OR COME FROM WHERE WE DO . THE WELFARE QUEEN IS TAKING OUR TAX MONEY . THE IMMIGRANT IS TAKING OUR JOBS . THE BELIEVER CONDEMNS THE NON-BELIEVER AS IMMORAL , AND THE NON-BELIEVER CHIDES THE BELIEVER AS INTOLERANT . FOR MOST OF THIS COUNTRY'S HISTORY , WE IN THE AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY HAVE BEEN AT THE RECEIVING END OF MAN'S INHUMANITY TO MAN . AND ALL OF US UNDERSTAND INTIMATELY THE INSIDIOUS ROLE THAT RACE STILL SOMETIMES PLAYS - ON THE JOB , IN THE SCHOOLS , IN OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM , AND IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM . AND YET , IF WE ARE HONEST WITH OURSELVES , WE MUST ADMIT THAT NONE OF OUR HANDS ARE ENTIRELY CLEAN . IF WE'RE HONEST WITH OURSELVES , WE'LL ACKNOWLEDGE THAT OUR OWN COMMUNITY HAS NOT ALWAYS BEEN TRUE TO KING'S VISION OF A BELOVED COMMUNITY . WE HAVE SCORNED OUR GAY BROTHERS AND SISTERS INSTEAD OF EMBRACING THEM . THE SCOURGE OF ANTI-SEMITISM HAS , AT TIMES , UNKNOWNWORD ITSELF IN OUR COMMUNITY . FOR TOO LONG , SOME OF US HAVE SEEN IMMIGRANTS AS COMPETITORS FOR JOBS INSTEAD OF COMPANIONS IN THE FIGHT FOR OPPORTUNITY . EVERY DAY , OUR POLITICS FUELS AND EXPLOITS THIS KIND OF DIVISION ACROSS ALL RACES AND REGIONS ; ACROSS GENDER AND PARTY . IT IS PLAYED OUT ON TELEVISION . IT IS SENSATIONALIZED BY THE MEDIA . AND LAST WEEK , IT EVEN CREPT INTO THE CAMPAIGN FOR PRESIDENT , WITH CHARGES AND COUNTER-CHARGES THAT SERVED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE ISSUES INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THE CRITICAL CHOICES WE FACE AS A NATION . SO LET US SAY THAT ON THIS DAY OF ALL DAYS , EACH OF US CARRIES WITH US THE TASK OF CHANGING OUR HEARTS AND MINDS . THE DIVISION , THE STEREOTYPES , THE SCAPE-GOATING , THE EASE WITH WHICH WE BLAME OUR PLIGHT ON OTHERS - ALL OF THIS DISTRACTS US FROM THE COMMON CHALLENGES WE FACE - WAR AND POVERTY ; INJUSTICE AND INEQUALITY . WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO BUILD OURSELVES UP BY TEARING SOMEONE ELSE DOWN . WE CAN NO LONGER AFFORD TO TRAFFIC IN LIES OR FEAR OR HATE . IT IS THE POISON THAT WE MUST PURGE FROM OUR POLITICS ; THE WALL THAT WE MUST TEAR DOWN BEFORE THE HOUR UNKNOWNWORD TOO LATE . BECAUSE IF DR . KING COULD LOVE HIS UNKNOWNWORD ; IF HE COULD CALL ON THE FAITHFUL WHO ONCE SAT WHERE YOU DO TO FORGIVE THOSE WHO SET DOGS AND FIRE HOSES UPON THEM , THEN SURELY WE CAN LOOK PAST WHAT DIVIDES US IN OUR TIME , AND BIND UP OUR WOUNDS , AND ERASE THE EMPATHY DEFICIT THAT EXISTS IN OUR HEARTS . BUT IF CHANGING OUR HEARTS AND MINDS IS THE FIRST CRITICAL STEP , WE CANNOT STOP THERE . IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO BEMOAN THE PLIGHT OF POOR CHILDREN IN THIS COUNTRY AND REMAIN UNWILLING TO PUSH OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS TO PROVIDE THE RESOURCES TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS . IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO DECRY THE DISPARITIES OF HEALTH CARE AND YET ALLOW THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES TO BLOCK MUCH-NEEDED REFORMS . IT IS NOT ENOUGH FOR US TO UNKNOWNWORD THE COSTS OF A MISGUIDED WAR , AND YET ALLOW OURSELVES TO BE DRIVEN BY A POLITICS OF FEAR THAT SEES THE THREAT OF ATTACK AS WAY TO SCARE UP VOTES INSTEAD OF A CALL TO COME TOGETHER AROUND A COMMON EFFORT . THE SCRIPTURE TELLS US THAT WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD NOT JUST BY WORD , BUT BY DEED . AND IF WE ARE TO TRULY BRING ABOUT THE UNITY THAT IS SO CRUCIAL IN THIS TIME , WE MUST FIND IT WITHIN OURSELVES TO ACT ON WHAT WE KNOW ; TO UNDERSTAND THAT LIVING UP TO THIS COUNTRY'S IDEALS AND ITS POSSIBILITIES WILL REQUIRE GREAT EFFORT AND RESOURCES ; SACRIFICE AND STAMINA . AND THAT IS WHAT IS AT STAKE IN THE GREAT POLITICAL DEBATE WE ARE HAVING TODAY . THE CHANGES THAT ARE NEEDED ARE NOT JUST A MATTER OF TINKERING AT THE EDGES , AND THEY WILL NOT COME IF POLITICIANS SIMPLY TELL US WHAT WE WANT TO HEAR . ALL OF US WILL BE CALLED UPON TO MAKE SOME SACRIFICE . NONE OF US WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD FROM RESPONSIBILITY . WE WILL HAVE TO FIGHT TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS , BUT WE WILL ALSO HAVE TO CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO BE BETTER PARENTS . WE WILL HAVE TO CONFRONT THE BIASES IN OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM , BUT WE WILL ALSO HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THE DEEP-SEATED VIOLENCE THAT STILL RESIDES IN OUR OWN COMMUNITIES AND MARSHAL THE WILL TO BREAK ITS GRIP . THAT IS HOW WE WILL BRING ABOUT THE CHANGE WE SEEK . THAT IS HOW DR . KING LED THIS COUNTRY THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD . HE DID IT WITH WORDS - WORDS THAT HE SPOKE NOT JUST TO THE CHILDREN OF SLAVES , BUT THE CHILDREN OF SLAVE OWNERS . WORDS THAT INSPIRED NOT JUST BLACK BUT ALSO WHITE ; NOT JUST THE CHRISTIAN BUT THE JEW ; NOT JUST THE SOUTHERNER BUT ALSO THE UNKNOWNWORD . HE LED WITH WORDS , BUT HE ALSO LED WITH DEEDS . HE ALSO LED BY EXAMPLE . HE LED BY UNKNOWNWORD AND GOING TO JAIL AND SUFFERING THREATS AND BEING AWAY FROM HIS FAMILY . HE LED BY TAKING A STAND AGAINST A WAR , KNOWING FULL WELL THAT IT WOULD DIMINISH HIS POPULARITY . HE LED BY CHALLENGING OUR ECONOMIC STRUCTURES , UNDERSTANDING THAT IT WOULD CAUSE DISCOMFORT . DR . KING UNDERSTOOD THAT UNITY CANNOT BE WON ON THE CHEAP ; THAT WE WOULD HAVE TO EARN IT THROUGH GREAT EFFORT AND DETERMINATION . THAT IS THE UNITY - THE HARD-EARNED UNITY - THAT WE NEED RIGHT NOW . IT IS THAT EFFORT , AND THAT DETERMINATION , THAT CAN TRANSFORM BLIND OPTIMISM INTO HOPE - THE HOPE TO IMAGINE , AND WORK FOR , AND FIGHT FOR WHAT SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE . THE STORIES THAT GIVE ME SUCH HOPE DON'T HAPPEN IN THE SPOTLIGHT . THEY DON'T HAPPEN ON THE PRESIDENTIAL STAGE . THEY HAPPEN IN THE QUIET CORNERS OF OUR LIVES . THEY HAPPEN IN THE MOMENTS WE LEAST EXPECT . LET ME GIVE YOU AN EXAMPLE OF ONE OF THOSE STORIES . THERE IS A YOUNG , UNKNOWNWORD YEAR OLD WHITE WOMAN NAMED ASHLEY UNKNOWNWORD WHO ORGANIZES FOR OUR CAMPAIGN IN FLORENCE , SOUTH CAROLINA . SHE'S BEEN WORKING TO ORGANIZE A MOSTLY AFRICAN-AMERICAN COMMUNITY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN , AND THE OTHER DAY SHE WAS AT A ROUNDTABLE DISCUSSION WHERE EVERYONE WENT AROUND TELLING THEIR STORY AND WHY THEY WERE THERE . AND ASHLEY SAID THAT WHEN SHE WAS NINE YEARS OLD , HER MOTHER GOT CANCER . AND BECAUSE SHE HAD TO MISS DAYS OF WORK , SHE WAS LET GO AND LOST HER HEALTH CARE . THEY HAD TO FILE FOR BANKRUPTCY , AND THAT'S WHEN ASHLEY DECIDED THAT SHE HAD TO DO SOMETHING TO HELP HER MOM . SHE KNEW THAT FOOD WAS ONE OF THEIR MOST EXPENSIVE COSTS , AND SO ASHLEY CONVINCED HER MOTHER THAT WHAT SHE REALLY LIKED AND REALLY WANTED TO EAT MORE THAN ANYTHING ELSE WAS MUSTARD AND UNKNOWNWORD SANDWICHES . BECAUSE THAT WAS THE CHEAPEST WAY TO EAT . SHE DID THIS FOR A YEAR UNTIL HER MOM GOT BETTER , AND SHE TOLD EVERYONE AT THE ROUNDTABLE THAT THE REASON SHE JOINED OUR CAMPAIGN WAS SO THAT SHE COULD HELP THE MILLIONS OF OTHER CHILDREN IN THE COUNTRY WHO WANT AND NEED TO HELP THEIR PARENTS TOO . SO ASHLEY FINISHES HER STORY AND THEN GOES AROUND THE ROOM AND ASKS EVERYONE ELSE WHY THEY'RE SUPPORTING THE CAMPAIGN . THEY ALL HAVE DIFFERENT STORIES AND REASONS . MANY BRING UP A SPECIFIC ISSUE . AND FINALLY THEY COME TO THIS ELDERLY BLACK MAN WHO'S BEEN SITTING THERE QUIETLY THE ENTIRE TIME . AND ASHLEY ASKS HIM WHY HE'S THERE . AND HE DOES NOT BRING UP A SPECIFIC ISSUE . HE DOES NOT SAY HEALTH CARE OR THE ECONOMY . HE DOES NOT SAY EDUCATION OR THE WAR . HE DOES NOT SAY THAT HE WAS THERE BECAUSE OF BARACK OBAMA . HE SIMPLY SAYS TO EVERYONE IN THE ROOM , "I AM HERE BECAUSE OF ASHLEY ." BY ITSELF , THAT SINGLE MOMENT OF RECOGNITION BETWEEN THAT YOUNG WHITE GIRL AND THAT OLD BLACK MAN IS NOT ENOUGH . IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO GIVE HEALTH CARE TO THE SICK , OR JOBS TO THE JOBLESS , OR EDUCATION TO OUR CHILDREN . BUT IT IS WHERE WE BEGIN . IT IS WHY THE WALLS IN THAT ROOM BEGAN TO CRACK AND SHAKE . AND IF THEY CAN SHAKE IN THAT ROOM , THEY CAN SHAKE IN ATLANTA . AND IF THEY CAN SHAKE IN ATLANTA , THEY CAN SHAKE IN GEORGIA . AND IF THEY CAN SHAKE IN GEORGIA , THEY CAN SHAKE ALL ACROSS AMERICA . AND IF ENOUGH OF OUR VOICES JOIN TOGETHER ; WE CAN BRING THOSE WALLS TUMBLING DOWN . THE WALLS OF JERICHO CAN FINALLY COME TUMBLING DOWN . THAT IS OUR HOPE - BUT ONLY IF WE PRAY TOGETHER , AND WORK TOGETHER , AND MARCH TOGETHER . BROTHERS AND SISTERS , WE CANNOT WALK ALONE . IN THE STRUGGLE FOR PEACE AND JUSTICE , WE CANNOT WALK ALONE . IN THE STRUGGLE FOR OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY , WE CANNOT WALK ALONE IN THE STRUGGLE TO HEAL THIS NATION AND REPAIR THIS WORLD , WE CANNOT WALK ALONE . SO I ASK YOU TO WALK WITH ME , AND MARCH WITH ME , AND JOIN YOUR VOICE WITH MINE , AND TOGETHER WE WILL SING THE SONG THAT TEARS DOWN THE WALLS THAT DIVIDE US , AND LIFT UP AN AMERICA THAT IS TRULY INDIVISIBLE , WITH LIBERTY , AND JUSTICE , FOR ALL . MAY GOD BLESS THE MEMORY OF THE GREAT PASTOR OF THIS CHURCH , AND MAY GOD BLESS THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA .
BLUE	THANK YOU , IOWA . YOU KNOW , THEY SAID THIS DAY WOULD NEVER COME . THEY SAID OUR SIGHTS WERE SET TOO HIGH . THEY SAID THIS COUNTRY WAS TOO DIVIDED ; TOO DISILLUSIONED TO EVER COME TOGETHER AROUND A COMMON PURPOSE . BUT ON THIS JANUARY NIGHT - AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT IN HISTORY - YOU HAVE DONE WHAT THE CYNICS SAID WE COULDN'T DO . YOU HAVE DONE WHAT THE STATE OF NEW HAMPSHIRE CAN DO IN FIVE DAYS . YOU HAVE DONE WHAT AMERICA CAN DO IN THIS NEW YEAR , 2008 . IN LINES THAT STRETCHED AROUND SCHOOLS AND CHURCHES ; IN SMALL TOWNS AND BIG CITIES ; YOU CAME TOGETHER AS DEMOCRATS , REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT WE ARE ONE NATION ; WE ARE ONE PEOPLE ; AND OUR TIME FOR CHANGE HAS COME . YOU SAID THE TIME HAS COME TO MOVE BEYOND THE BITTERNESS AND PETTINESS AND ANGER THAT'S CONSUMED WASHINGTON ; TO END THE POLITICAL STRATEGY THAT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT DIVISION AND INSTEAD MAKE IT ABOUT ADDITION - TO BUILD A COALITION FOR CHANGE THAT STRETCHES THROUGH RED STATES AND BLUE STATES . BECAUSE THAT'S HOW WE'LL WIN IN NOVEMBER , AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL FINALLY MEET THE CHALLENGES THAT WE FACE AS A NATION . WE ARE CHOOSING HOPE OVER FEAR . WE'RE CHOOSING UNITY OVER DIVISION , AND SENDING A POWERFUL MESSAGE THAT CHANGE IS COMING TO AMERICA . YOU SAID THE TIME HAS COME TO TELL THE LOBBYISTS WHO THINK THEIR MONEY AND THEIR INFLUENCE SPEAK UNKNOWNWORD THAN OUR VOICES THAT THEY DON'T OWN THIS GOVERNMENT , WE DO ; AND WE ARE HERE TO TAKE IT BACK . THE TIME HAS COME FOR A PRESIDENT WHO WILL BE HONEST ABOUT THE CHOICES AND THE CHALLENGES WE FACE ; WHO WILL LISTEN TO YOU AND LEARN FROM YOU EVEN WHEN WE DISAGREE ; WHO WON'T JUST TELL YOU WHAT YOU WANT TO HEAR , BUT WHAT YOU NEED TO KNOW . AND IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , IF YOU GIVE ME THE SAME CHANCE THAT IOWA DID TONIGHT , I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT FOR AMERICA . THANK YOU . I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO FINALLY MAKES HEALTH CARE AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN THE SAME WAY I EXPANDED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS - BY--BY BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER TO GET THE JOB DONE . I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO ENDS THE TAX BREAKS FOR COMPANIES THAT SHIP OUR JOBS OVERSEAS AND PUT A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUT INTO THE POCKETS OF THE WORKING AMERICANS WHO DESERVE IT . I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO HARNESSES THE INGENUITY OF FARMERS AND SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS TO FREE THIS NATION FROM THE TYRANNY OF OIL ONCE AND FOR ALL . AND I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO ENDS THIS WAR IN IRAQ AND FINALLY BRINGS OUR TROOPS HOME ; WHO RESTORES OUR MORAL STANDING ; WHO UNDERSTANDS THAT 9/11 IS NOT A WAY TO SCARE UP VOTES , BUT A CHALLENGE THAT SHOULD UNITE AMERICA AND THE WORLD AGAINST THE COMMON THREATS OF THE TWENTY-FIRST CENTURY ; COMMON THREATS OF TERRORISM AND NUCLEAR WEAPONS ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND DISEASE . TONIGHT , WE ARE ONE STEP CLOSER TO THAT VISION OF AMERICA BECAUSE OF WHAT YOU DID HERE IN IOWA . AND SO I'D ESPECIALLY LIKE TO THANK THE ORGANIZERS AND THE PRECINCT CAPTAINS ; THE VOLUNTEERS AND THE STAFF WHO MADE THIS ALL POSSIBLE . AND WHILE I'M AT IT , ON "THANK UNKNOWNWORD ," I THINK IT MAKES SENSE FOR ME TO THANK THE LOVE OF MY LIFE , THE ROCK OF THE OBAMA FAMILY , THE CLOSER ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL ; GIVE IT UP FOR MICHELLE OBAMA . I KNOW YOU DIDN'T DO THIS FOR ME . YOU DID UNKNOWNWORD DID THIS BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED SO DEEPLY IN THE MOST AMERICAN OF IDEAS - THAT IN THE FACE OF IMPOSSIBLE ODDS , PEOPLE WHO LOVE THIS COUNTRY CAN CHANGE IT . I KNOW UNKNOWNWORD KNOW THIS BECAUSE WHILE I MAY BE STANDING HERE TONIGHT , I'LL NEVER FORGET THAT MY JOURNEY BEGAN ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO DOING WHAT SO MANY OF YOU HAVE DONE FOR THIS CAMPAIGN AND ALL THE CAMPAIGNS HERE IN IOWA - ORGANIZING , AND WORKING , AND FIGHTING TO MAKE PEOPLE'S LIVES JUST A LITTLE BIT BETTER . I KNOW HOW HARD IT IS . IT COMES WITH LITTLE SLEEP , LITTLE PAY , AND A LOT OF SACRIFICE . THERE ARE DAYS OF DISAPPOINTMENT , BUT SOMETIMES , JUST SOMETIMES , THERE ARE NIGHTS LIKE THIS - A NIGHT-A NIGHT THAT , YEARS FROM NOW , WHEN WE'VE MADE THE CHANGES WE BELIEVE IN ; WHEN MORE FAMILIES CAN AFFORD TO SEE A DOCTOR ; WHEN OUR UNKNOWNWORD MALIA AND UNKNOWNWORD AND YOUR CHILDREN-INHERIT A PLANET THAT'S A LITTLE CLEANER AND SAFER ; WHEN THE WORLD SEES AMERICA DIFFERENTLY , AND AMERICA SEES ITSELF AS A NATION LESS DIVIDED AND MORE UNITED ; YOU'LL BE ABLE TO LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE AND SAY THAT THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN IT ALL BEGAN . THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN THE IMPROBABLE BEAT WHAT WASHINGTON ALWAYS SAID WAS INEVITABLE . THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN WE TORE DOWN BARRIERS THAT HAVE DIVIDED US FOR TOO LONG - WHEN WE RALLIED PEOPLE OF ALL PARTIES AND AGES TO A COMMON CAUSE ; WHEN WE FINALLY GAVE AMERICANS WHO'D NEVER PARTICIPATED IN POLITICS A REASON TO STAND UP AND TO DO SO . THIS WAS THE MOMENT WHEN WE FINALLY BEAT BACK THE POLITICS OF FEAR , AND DOUBT , AND CYNICISM ; THE POLITICS WHERE WE TEAR EACH OTHER DOWN INSTEAD OF LIFTING THIS COUNTRY UP . THIS WAS THE MOMENT . YEARS FROM NOW , YOU'LL LOOK BACK AND YOU'LL SAY THAT THIS WAS THE MOMENT - THIS WAS THE PLACE - WHERE AMERICA REMEMBERED WHAT IT MEANS TO HOPE . FOR MANY MONTHS , WE'VE BEEN TEASED , EVEN DERIDED FOR TALKING ABOUT HOPE . BUT WE ALWAYS KNEW THAT HOPE IS NOT BLIND OPTIMISM . IT'S NOT IGNORING THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK AHEAD OR THE ROADBLOCKS THAT STAND IN OUR PATH . IT'S NOT SITTING ON THE SIDELINES OR UNKNOWNWORD FROM A FIGHT . HOPE IS THAT THING INSIDE US THAT INSISTS , DESPITE ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY , THAT SOMETHING BETTER AWAITS US IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO REACH FOR IT , AND TO WORK FOR IT , AND TO FIGHT FOR IT . HOPE IS WHAT I SAW IN THE EYES OF THE YOUNG WOMAN IN CEDAR RAPIDS WHO WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT AFTER A FULL DAY OF COLLEGE AND STILL CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE FOR A SISTER WHO'S ILL ; A YOUNG WOMAN WHO STILL BELIEVES THAT THIS COUNTRY WILL GIVE HER THE CHANCE TO LIVE OUT HER DREAMS . HOPE IS WHAT I HEARD IN THE VOICE OF THE NEW HAMPSHIRE WOMAN WHO TOLD ME THAT SHE HASN'T BEEN ABLE TO BREATHE SINCE HER NEPHEW LEFT FOR IRAQ ; WHO STILL GOES TO BED EACH NIGHT PRAYING FOR HIS SAFE RETURN . HOPE IS WHAT LED A BAND OF COLONISTS TO RISE UP AGAINST AN EMPIRE ; WHAT LED THE GREATEST OF GENERATIONS TO FREE A CONTINENT AND HEAL A NATION ; WHAT LED YOUNG WOMEN AND YOUNG MEN TO SIT AT LUNCH COUNTERS AND BRAVE FIRE HOSES AND MARCH THROUGH SELMA AND MONTGOMERY FOR FREEDOM'S CAUSE . HOPE-HOPE-IS WHAT LED ME HERE TODAY - WITH A FATHER FROM KENYA ; A MOTHER FROM KANSAS ; AND A STORY THAT COULD ONLY HAPPEN IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . HOPE IS THE BEDROCK OF THIS NATION ; THE BELIEF THAT OUR DESTINY WILL NOT BE WRITTEN FOR US , BUT BY US ; BY ALL THOSE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE NOT CONTENT TO SETTLE FOR THE WORLD AS IT IS ; WHO HAVE THE COURAGE TO REMAKE THE WORLD AS IT SHOULD BE . THAT IS WHAT WE STARTED HERE IN IOWA , AND THAT IS THE MESSAGE WE CAN NOW CARRY TO NEW HAMPSHIRE AND BEYOND ; THE SAME MESSAGE WE HAD WHEN WE WERE UP AND WHEN WE WERE DOWN ; THE ONE THAT CAN CHANGE THIS COUNTRY BRICK BY BRICK , BLOCK BY BLOCK , CALLOUSED HAND BY CALLOUSED HAND - THAT TOGETHER , ORDINARY PEOPLE CAN DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS ; BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A COLLECTION OF RED STATES AND BLUE STATES , WE ARE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ; AND AT THIS MOMENT , IN THIS ELECTION , WE ARE READY TO BELIEVE AGAIN . THANK YOU , IOWA .
BLUE	TEN MONTHS AGO , I STOOD ON THE STEPS OF THE OLD STATE CAPITOL IN SPRINGFIELD , ILLINOIS , AND BEGAN AN UNLIKELY JOURNEY TO CHANGE AMERICA . I DID NOT RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO FULFILL SOME LONG-HELD AMBITION OR BECAUSE I BELIEVED IT WAS SOMEHOW OWED TO ME . I CHOSE TO RUN IN THIS ELECTION - AT THIS MOMENT - BECAUSE OF WHAT DR . KING CALLED "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW ." BECAUSE WE ARE AT A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . OUR PLANET IS IN PERIL . OUR HEALTH CARE SYSTEM IS BROKEN , OUR ECONOMY IS OUT OF BALANCE , OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM FAILS TOO MANY OF OUR CHILDREN , AND OUR RETIREMENT SYSTEM IS IN TATTERS . AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT , WE CANNOT WAIT ANY LONGER FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE . WE CANNOT WAIT TO FIX OUR SCHOOLS . WE CANNOT WAIT FOR GOOD JOBS , AND LIVING WAGES , AND PENSIONS WE CAN COUNT ON . WE CANNOT WAIT TO UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL WARMING , AND WE CANNOT WAIT TO END THIS WAR IN IRAQ . I CHOSE TO RUN BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT THE SIZE OF THESE CHALLENGES HAD OUTGROWN THE CAPACITY OF OUR BROKEN AND DIVIDED POLITICS TO SOLVE THEM ; BECAUSE I BELIEVED THAT AMERICANS OF EVERY POLITICAL STRIPE WERE HUNGRY FOR A NEW KIND OF POLITICS , A POLITICS THAT FOCUSED NOT JUST ON HOW TO WIN BUT WHY WE SHOULD , A POLITICS THAT FOCUSED ON THOSE VALUES AND IDEALS THAT WE HELD IN COMMON AS AMERICANS ; A POLITICS THAT FAVORED COMMON SENSE OVER IDEOLOGY , STRAIGHT TALK OVER SPIN . MOST OF ALL , I BELIEVED IN THE POWER OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO BE THE REAL AGENTS OF CHANGE IN THIS COUNTRY - BECAUSE WE ARE NOT AS DIVIDED AS OUR POLITICS SUGGESTS ; BECAUSE WE ARE A DECENT , GENEROUS PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND SACRIFICE FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS ; AND I WAS CERTAIN THAT IF WE COULD JUST UNKNOWNWORD OUR VOICES TO CHALLENGE THE SPECIAL INTERESTS THAT DOMINATE WASHINGTON AND CHALLENGE OURSELVES TO REACH FOR SOMETHING BETTER , THERE WAS NO PROBLEM WE COULDN'T SOLVE - NO DESTINY WE COULDN'T FULFILL . TEN MONTHS LATER , IOWA , YOU HAVE VINDICATED THAT FAITH . YOU'VE COME OUT IN THE UNKNOWNWORD HEAT AND THE BITTER COLD NOT JUST TO CHEER , BUT TO CHALLENGE - TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS ; TO LIFT THE HOOD AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD ; TO SERVE AS ONE PLACE IN AMERICA WHERE SOMEONE WHO HASN'T SPENT THEIR LIFE IN THE WASHINGTON SPOTLIGHT CAN GET A FAIR HEARING . YOU'VE EARNED THE ROLE YOU PLAY IN OUR DEMOCRACY BECAUSE NO ONE TAKES IT MORE SERIOUSLY . AND I BELIEVE THAT'S TRUE THIS YEAR MORE THAN EVER BECAUSE , LIKE ME , YOU FEEL THAT SAME SENSE OF URGENCY . ALL ACROSS THIS STATE , YOU'VE SHARED WITH ME YOUR STORIES . AND ALL TOO OFTEN THEY'VE BEEN STORIES OF STRUGGLE AND HARDSHIP . I'VE HEARD FROM SENIORS WHO WERE BETRAYED BY CEOS WHO DUMPED THEIR PENSIONS WHILE UNKNOWNWORD BONUSES , AND FROM THOSE WHO STILL CAN'T AFFORD THEIR PRESCRIPTIONS BECAUSE CONGRESS REFUSED TO NEGOTIATE WITH THE DRUG COMPANIES FOR THE CHEAPEST AVAILABLE PRICE . I'VE MET MAYTAG WORKERS WHO LABORED ALL THEIR LIVES ONLY TO SEE THEIR JOBS SHIPPED OVERSEAS ; WHO NOW COMPETE WITH THEIR TEENAGERS FOR $7-AN-HOUR JOBS AT WAL-MART . I'VE SPOKEN WITH TEACHERS WHO ARE WORKING AT DONUT UNKNOWNWORD AFTER SCHOOL JUST TO MAKE ENDS MEET ; WHO ARE STILL DIGGING INTO THEIR OWN POCKETS TO PAY FOR SCHOOL SUPPLIES . JUST TWO WEEKS AGO , I HEARD A YOUNG WOMAN IN CEDAR RAPIDS WHO TOLD ME SHE ONLY GETS THREE HOURS OF SLEEP BECAUSE SHE WORKS THE NIGHT SHIFT AFTER A FULL DAY OF COLLEGE AND STILL CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH CARE FOR A SISTER WITH CEREBRAL PALSY . SHE SPOKE NOT WITH SELF-PITY BUT WITH DETERMINATION , AND WONDERS WHY THE GOVERNMENT ISN'T DOING MORE TO HELP HER AFFORD THE EDUCATION THAT WILL ALLOW HER TO LIVE OUT HER DREAMS . I'VE SPOKEN TO VETERANS WHO TALK WITH PRIDE ABOUT WHAT THEY'VE ACCOMPLISHED IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ , BUT WHO NEVERTHELESS THINK OF THOSE THEY'VE LEFT BEHIND AND QUESTION THE WISDOM OF OUR MISSION IN IRAQ ; THE MOTHERS WEEPING IN MY ARMS OVER THE MEMORIES OF THEIR SONS ; THE DISABLED OR HOMELESS VETS WHO WONDER WHY THEIR SERVICE HAS BEEN FORGOTTEN . AND I'VE SPOKEN TO AMERICANS IN EVERY CORNER OF THE STATE , PATRIOTS ALL , WHO WONDER WHY WE HAVE ALLOWED OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD TO DECLINE SO BADLY , SO QUICKLY . THEY KNOW THIS HAS NOT MADE US SAFER . THEY KNOW THAT WE MUST NEVER NEGOTIATE OUT OF FEAR , BUT THAT WE MUST NEVER FEAR TO NEGOTIATE WITH OUR ENEMIES AS WELL AS OUR FRIENDS . THEY ARE ASHAMED OF ABU GRAIB AND GUANTANAMO AND WARRANTLESS WIRETAPS AND UNKNOWNWORD ON TORTURE . THEY LOVE THEIR COUNTRY AND WANT ITS CHERISHED VALUES AND IDEALS RESTORED . IT IS PRECISELY BECAUSE YOU'VE EXPERIENCE THESE UNKNOWNWORD , AND SEEN THE COST OF INACTION IN YOUR OWN LIVES , THAT YOU UNDERSTAND WHY WE CAN'T AFFORD TO SETTLE FOR THE SAME OLD POLITICS . YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO ALLOW THE INSURANCE LOBBYISTS TO KILL HEALTH CARE REFORM ONE MORE TIME , AND THE OIL LOBBYISTS TO KEEP US ADDICTED TO FOSSIL FUELS BECAUSE NO ONE STOOD UP AND TOOK THEIR POWER AWAY WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE . YOU KNOW THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD FOUR MORE YEARS OF THE SAME DIVISIVE FOOD FIGHT IN WASHINGTON THAT'S ABOUT SCORING POLITICAL POINTS INSTEAD OF SOLVING PROBLEMS ; THAT'S ABOUT TEARING YOUR OPPONENTS DOWN INSTEAD OF LIFTING THIS COUNTRY UP . WE CAN'T AFFORD THE SAME POLITICS OF FEAR THAT TELLS DEMOCRATS THAT THE ONLY WAY TO LOOK TOUGH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IS TO TALK , ACT , AND VOTE LIKE GEORGE BUSH REPUBLICANS ; THAT INVOKES 9/11 AS A WAY TO SCARE UP VOTES INSTEAD OF A CHALLENGE THAT SHOULD UNITE ALL AMERICANS TO DEFEAT OUR REAL ENEMIES . WE CAN'T AFFORD TO BE SO WORRIED ABOUT LOSING THE NEXT ELECTION THAT WE LOSE THE BATTLES WE OWE TO THE NEXT GENERATION . THE REAL GAMBLE IN THIS ELECTION IS PLAYING THE SAME WASHINGTON GAME WITH THE SAME WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD A DIFFERENT RESULT . AND THAT'S A RISK WE CAN'T TAKE . NOT THIS YEAR . NOT WHEN THE STAKES ARE THIS HIGH . IN THIS ELECTION , IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE . IN SEVEN DAYS , IT IS TIME TO STAND FOR CHANGE . THIS HAS BEEN OUR MESSAGE SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS CAMPAIGN . IT WAS OUR MESSAGE WHEN WE WERE DOWN , AND OUR MESSAGE WHEN WE WERE UP . AND IT MUST BE CATCHING ON , BECAUSE IN THESE LAST FEW WEEKS , EVERYONE IS TALKING ABOUT CHANGE . BUT YOU CAN'T AT ONCE ARGUE THAT YOU'RE THE MASTER OF A BROKEN SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON AND OFFER YOURSELF AS THE PERSON TO CHANGE IT . YOU CAN'T FALL IN LINE BEHIND THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING ON ISSUES AS PROFOUND AS WAR AND OFFER YOURSELF AS THE LEADER WHO IS BEST PREPARED TO CHART A NEW AND BETTER COURSE FOR AMERICA . THE TRUTH IS , YOU CAN HAVE THE RIGHT KIND OF EXPERIENCE AND THE WRONG KIND OF EXPERIENCE . MINE IS ROOTED IN THE REAL LIVES OF REAL PEOPLE AND IT WILL BRING REAL RESULTS IF WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO CHANGE . I BELIEVE DEEPLY IN THOSE WORDS . BUT THEY ARE NOT MINE . THEY WERE BILL CLINTON'S IN 1992 , WHEN WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HIS READINESS TO LEAD . MY EXPERIENCE IS ROOTED IN THE LIVES OF THE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO WHO I FOUGHT FOR AS AN ORGANIZER WHEN THE LOCAL STEEL PLANT CLOSED . IT'S ROOTED IN THE LIVES OF THE PEOPLE I STOOD UP FOR AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER WHEN THEY WERE DENIED OPPORTUNITY ON THE JOB OR JUSTICE AT THE VOTING BOOTH BECAUSE OF WHAT THEY LOOKED LIKE OR WHERE THEY CAME FROM . IT'S ROOTED IN AN UNDERSTANDING OF HOW THE WORLD SEES AMERICA THAT I GAINED FROM LIVING , TRAVELING , AND HAVING FAMILY BEYOND OUR SHORES - AN UNDERSTANDING THAT LED ME TO OPPOSE THIS WAR IN IRAQ FROM THE START . IT'S EXPERIENCE ROOTED IN THE REAL LIVES OF REAL PEOPLE , AND IT'S THE KIND OF EXPERIENCE WASHINGTON NEEDS RIGHT NOW . THERE ARE OTHERS IN THIS RACE WHO SAY THAT THIS KIND OF CHANGE SOUNDS GOOD , BUT THAT I'M NOT ANGRY OR CONFRONTATIONAL ENOUGH TO GET IT DONE . WELL , LET ME TELL YOU SOMETHING , IOWA . I DON'T NEED ANY LECTURES ON HOW TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE , BECAUSE I HAVEN'T JUST TALKED ABOUT IT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL . I'VE FOUGHT FOR CHANGE ALL MY LIFE . I WALKED AWAY FROM A JOB ON WALL STREET TO BRING JOB TRAINING TO THE JOBLESS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS TO KIDS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO . I TURNED DOWN THE BIG MONEY LAW FIRMS TO WIN JUSTICE FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER . I TOOK ON THE LOBBYISTS IN ILLINOIS AND BROUGHT DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE TO 150,000 PEOPLE AND PASS THE FIRST MAJOR CAMPAIGN FINANCE REFORM IN TWENTY-FIVE YEARS ; AND I DID THE SAME THING IN WASHINGTON WHEN WE PASSED THE TOUGHEST LOBBYING REFORM SINCE WATERGATE . I'M THE ONLY CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE WHO HASN'T JUST TALKED ABOUT TAKING POWER AWAY FROM LOBBYISTS , I'VE ACTUALLY DONE IT . SO IF YOU WANT TO KNOW WHAT KIND OF CHOICES WE'LL MAKE AS PRESIDENT , YOU SHOULD TAKE A LOOK AT THE CHOICES WE MADE WHEN WE HAD THE CHANCE TO BRING ABOUT CHANGE THAT WASN'T EASY OR CONVENIENT . THAT'S THE KIND OF CHANGE THAT'S MORE THAN JUST RHETORIC - THAT'S CHANGE YOU CAN BELIEVE IN . IT'S CHANGE THAT WON'T JUST COME FROM MORE ANGER AT WASHINGTON OR TURNING UP THE HEAT ON REPUBLICANS . THERE'S NO SHORTAGE OF ANGER AND BLUSTER AND BITTER PARTISANSHIP OUT THERE . WE DON'T NEED MORE HEAT . WE NEED MORE LIGHT . I'VE LEARNED IN MY LIFE THAT YOU CAN STAND FIRM IN YOUR PRINCIPLES WHILE STILL REACHING OUT TO THOSE WHO MIGHT NOT ALWAYS AGREE WITH YOU . AND ALTHOUGH THE REPUBLICAN OPERATIVES IN WASHINGTON MIGHT NOT BE INTERESTED IN HEARING WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY , I THINK REPUBLICAN AND INDEPENDENT VOTERS OUTSIDE OF WASHINGTON ARE . THAT'S THE ONCE-IN-A-GENERATION OPPORTUNITY WE HAVE IN THIS ELECTION . FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME , WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO BUILD A NEW MAJORITY OF NOT JUST DEMOCRATS , BUT INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO'VE LOST FAITH IN THEIR WASHINGTON LEADERS BUT WANT TO BELIEVE AGAIN - WHO DESPERATELY WANT SOMETHING NEW . WE CAN CHANGE THE ELECTORAL MATH THAT'S BEEN ALL ABOUT DIVISION AND MAKE IT ABOUT ADDITION - ABOUT BUILDING A COALITION FOR CHANGE AND PROGRESS THAT STRETCHES THROUGH BLUE STATES AND RED STATES . THAT'S HOW I WON SOME OF THE REDDEST , MOST REPUBLICAN COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS . THAT'S WHY THE POLLS SHOW THAT I DO BEST AGAINST THE REPUBLICANS RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT - BECAUSE WE'RE ATTRACTING MORE SUPPORT FROM INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE . THAT'S HOW WE'LL WIN IN NOVEMBER AND THAT'S HOW WE'LL CHANGE THIS COUNTRY OVER THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . IN THE END , THE ARGUMENT WE ARE HAVING BETWEEN THE CANDIDATES IN THE LAST SEVEN DAYS IS NOT JUST ABOUT THE MEANING OF CHANGE . IT'S ABOUT THE MEANING OF HOPE . SOME OF MY OPPONENTS APPEAR SCORNFUL OF THE WORD ; THEY THINK IT SPEAKS OF NAIVETE , PASSIVITY , AND WISHFUL THINKING . BUT THAT'S NOT WHAT HOPE IS . HOPE IS NOT BLIND OPTIMISM . IT'S NOT IGNORING THE ENORMITY OF THE TASK BEFORE US OR THE ROADBLOCKS THAT STAND IN OUR PATH . YES , THE LOBBYISTS WILL FIGHT US . YES , THE REPUBLICAN ATTACK DOGS WILL GO AFTER US IN THE GENERAL ELECTION . YES , THE PROBLEMS OF POVERTY AND CLIMATE CHANGE AND FAILING SCHOOLS WILL RESIST EASY REPAIR . I KNOW - I'VE BEEN ON THE STREETS , I'VE BEEN IN THE COURTS . I'VE WATCHED LEGISLATION DIE BECAUSE THE POWERFUL HELD SWAY AND GOOD INTENTIONS WEREN'T UNKNOWNWORD BY POLITICAL WILL , AND I'VE WATCHED A NATION GET MISLEAD INTO WAR BECAUSE NO ONE HAD THE JUDGMENT OR THE COURAGE TO ASK THE HARD QUESTIONS BEFORE WE SENT OUR TROOPS TO FIGHT . BUT I ALSO KNOW THIS . I KNOW THAT HOPE HAS BEEN THE GUIDING FORCE BEHIND THE MOST IMPROBABLE CHANGES THIS COUNTRY HAS EVER MADE . IN THE FACE OF TYRANNY , IT'S WHAT LED A BAND OF COLONISTS TO RISE UP AGAINST AN EMPIRE . IN THE FACE OF SLAVERY , IT'S WHAT FUELED THE RESISTANCE OF THE SLAVE AND THE ABOLITIONIST , AND WHAT ALLOWED A PRESIDENT TO CHART A TREACHEROUS COURSE TO ENSURE THAT THE NATION WOULD NOT CONTINUE HALF SLAVE AND HALF FREE . IN THE FACE OF WAR AND DEPRESSION , IT'S WHAT LED THE GREATEST OF GENERATIONS TO FREE A CONTINENT AND HEAL A NATION . IN THE FACE OF OPPRESSION , IT'S WHAT LED YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO SIT AT LUNCH COUNTERS AND BRAVE FIRE HOSES AND MARCH THROUGH THE STREETS OF SELMA AND MONTGOMERY FOR FREEDOM'S CAUSE . THAT'S THE POWER OF HOPE - TO IMAGINE , AND THEN WORK FOR , WHAT HAD SEEMED IMPOSSIBLE BEFORE . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE SEEK . AND THAT'S THE CHANGE YOU CAN STAND FOR IN SEVEN DAYS . WE'VE ALREADY BEATEN ODDS THAT THE CYNICS SAID COULDN'T BE BEATEN . WHEN WE STARTED TEN MONTHS AGO , THEY SAID WE COULDN'T RUN A DIFFERENT KIND OF CAMPAIGN . THEY SAID WE COULDN'T COMPETE WITHOUT TAKING MONEY FROM WASHINGTON LOBBYISTS . BUT YOU PROVED THEM WRONG WHEN WE RAISED MORE SMALL DONATIONS FROM MORE AMERICANS THAN ANY OTHER CAMPAIGN IN HISTORY . THEY SAID WE COULDN'T BE SUCCESSFUL IF WE DIDN'T HAVE THE FULL SUPPORT OF THE ESTABLISHMENT IN WASHINGTON . BUT YOU PROVED THEM WRONG WHEN WE BUILT A GRASSROOTS MOVEMENT THAT COULD FOREVER CHANGE THE FACE OF AMERICAN POLITICS . THEY SAID WE WOULDN'T HAVE A CHANCE IN THIS CAMPAIGN UNLESS WE RESORTED TO THE SAME OLD NEGATIVE ATTACKS . BUT WE RESISTED , EVEN WHEN WE WERE WRITTEN OFF , AND RAN A POSITIVE CAMPAIGN THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUT REAL DIFFERENCES AND REJECTED THE POLITICS OF SLASH AND BURN . AND NOW , IN SEVEN DAYS , YOU HAVE A CHANCE ONCE AGAIN TO PROVE THE CYNICS WRONG . IN SEVEN DAYS , WHAT WAS IMPROBABLE HAS THE CHANCE TO BEAT WHAT WASHINGTON SAID WAS INEVITABLE . AND THAT'S WHY IN THESE LAST WEEKS , WASHINGTON IS FIGHTING BACK WITH EVERYTHING IT HAS -- WITH ATTACK ADS AND INSULTS ; WITH DISTRACTIONS AND DISHONESTY ; WITH MILLIONS OF DOLLARS FROM OUTSIDE GROUPS AND UNKNOWNWORD DONORS TO TRY AND BLOCK OUR PATH . WE'VE SEEN THIS UNKNOWNWORD MANY TIMES BEFORE . BUT I KNOW THAT THIS TIME CAN BE DIFFERENT . BECAUSE I KNOW THAT WHEN THE AMERICAN PEOPLE BELIEVE IN SOMETHING , IT HAPPENS . IF YOU BELIEVE , THEN WE CAN TELL THE LOBBYISTS THAT THEIR DAYS OF SETTING THE AGENDA IN WASHINGTON ARE OVER . IF YOU BELIEVE , THEN WE CAN STOP MAKING PROMISES TO AMERICA'S WORKERS AND START DELIVERING - JOBS THAT PAY , HEALTH CARE THAT'S AFFORDABLE , PENSIONS YOU CAN COUNT ON , AND A TAX CUT FOR WORKING AMERICANS INSTEAD OF THE COMPANIES WHO SEND THEIR JOBS OVERSEAS . IF YOU BELIEVE , WE CAN OFFER A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION TO EVERY CHILD , AND PAY OUR TEACHERS MORE , AND MAKE COLLEGE DREAMS A REALITY FOR EVERY AMERICAN . IF YOU BELIEVE , WE CAN SAVE THIS PLANET AND END OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL . IF YOU BELIEVE , WE CAN END THIS WAR , CLOSE GUANTANAMO , RESTORE OUR STANDING , RENEW OUR DIPLOMACY , AND ONCE AGAIN RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . THAT'S THE FUTURE WITHIN OUR REACH . THAT'S WHAT HOPE IS - THAT THING INSIDE US THAT INSISTS , DESPITE ALL EVIDENCE TO THE CONTRARY , THAT SOMETHING BETTER IS WAITING FOR US AROUND THE CORNER . BUT ONLY IF WE'RE WILLING TO WORK FOR IT AND FIGHT FOR IT . TO SHED OUR FEARS AND OUR DOUBTS AND OUR CYNICISM . TO GLORY IN THE TASK BEFORE US OF UNKNOWNWORD THIS COUNTRY BLOCK BY BLOCK , PRECINCT BY PRECINCT , COUNTY BY COUNTY , STATE BY STATE . THERE IS A MOMENT IN THE LIFE OF EVERY GENERATION WHEN , IF WE ARE TO MAKE OUR MARK ON HISTORY , THIS SPIRIT MUST BREAK THROUGH THIS IS THE MOMENT . THIS IS OUR TIME . AND IF YOU WILL STAND WITH ME IN SEVEN DAYS - IF YOU WILL STAND FOR CHANGE SO THAT OUR CHILDREN HAVE THE SAME CHANCE THAT SOMEBODY GAVE US ; IF YOU'LL STAND TO KEEP THE AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE FOR THOSE WHO STILL HUNGER FOR OPPORTUNITY AND THIRST FOR JUSTICE ; IF YOU'RE READY TO STOP SETTLING FOR WHAT THE CYNICS TELL YOU YOU MUST ACCEPT , AND FINALLY REACH FOR WHAT YOU KNOW IS POSSIBLE , THEN WE WILL WIN THIS CAUCUS , WE WILL WIN THIS ELECTION , WE WILL CHANGE THE COURSE OF HISTORY , AND THE REAL JOURNEY - TO HEAL A NATION AND REPAIR THE WORLD - WILL HAVE TRULY BEGUN . THANK YOU .
BLUE	THIS IS A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR SECURITY IS THREATENED . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . OUR PLANET IS IN PERIL . THE STRENGTH , STANDING AND LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAVE FOUGHT AND WORKED FOR IS AT STAKE . IOWANS UNDERSTAND THIS . EVERYWHERE I GO . FROM SIOUX CITY TO DES MOINES TO DAVENPORT . I'M ASKED ABOUT THE CHANGES WE NEED TO MAKE IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT IN A WORLD OF STATELESS TERRORISTS AND SPREADING TECHNOLOGY , OUR OWN SECURITY AND PROSPERITY IS TIED TO WHAT HAPPENS AROUND THE WORLD . YOU WANT TO BE PROUD OF WHAT AMERICA STANDS FOR , AND YOU KNOW THAT AMERICA IS STRONGER - AND SAFER - WHEN OUR POLICIES REFLECT OUR CORE VALUES . THIS CAME UP IN OUR RECENT DEBATE HERE IN DES MOINES . I WAS ASKED HOW I PLAN TO CHANGE OUR FOREIGN POLICY , EVEN AS I'M ADVISED BY MEMBERS OF PREVIOUS ADMINISTRATIONS . I'M THANKFUL TO BE JOINED ON THIS STAGE TODAY BY TWO OF THOSE ADVISORS - TONY LAKE AND SUSAN RICE , AS WELL AS GENERAL SCOTT GRATION AND SENATOR STEVE WARNSTADT . AND I LOOK FORWARD TO DRAWING ON ALL OF THE TALENT THAT I CAN GET WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES - BECAUSE UNLIKE GEORGE BUSH , I'M NOT GOING TO DEMAND AN IDEOLOGICAL OR LOYALTY TEST FOR MY ADVISORS . BUT THE ANSWER TO THE QUESTION IS SIMPLE . THERE ARE MOMENTS IN HISTORY WHEN IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO FALL BACK ON CONVENTIONAL WAYS OF DOING THINGS , BECAUSE THE THREATS WE FACE ARE UNCONVENTIONAL . THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WE'RE CALLED TO STAND UP FOR WHAT IS RIGHT EVEN IF IT'S NOT POPULAR , BECAUSE THAT'S WHAT MAKES US STRONGER AND SAFER . THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN NEW CHALLENGES DEMAND NEW AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . THIS IS ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS ; I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO OFFER THAT LEADERSHIP ; AND I WELCOME THE SUPPORT OF ALL WHO WILL HELP ME CHART THIS COURSE . I AM RUNNING TO DO MORE THAN END A WAR IN IRAQ - I AM RUNNING TO CHANGE THE MINDSET THAT GOT US INTO WAR . IT'S EASY FOR US TO UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF THE PROBLEMS OF THE WORLD AT GEORGE BUSH'S UNKNOWNWORD . HIS JUDGMENTS WILL BE SUBJECT TO THE HARSH LIGHT OF HISTORY , AND THE VERDICT WILL NOT BE KIND . BUT THE QUESTION IS WHAT COMES NEXT . BECAUSE WE ALSO HAVE TO CHANGE A CONVENTIONAL WAY OF THINKING ABOUT FOREIGN POLICY THAT VALUES TIME SPENT IN WASHINGTON OVER UNKNOWNWORD JUDGMENTS ; POSTURING OVER UNKNOWNWORD ; AND FEAR OF LOOKING WEAK OVER THE CONVICTION TO GET THINGS RIGHT . HERE , I ASK YOU TO LOOK NO FURTHER THAN MY RECORD . GEORGE BUSH DID NOT TAKE US TO WAR ALONE . CONGRESS GAVE HIM THAT AUTHORITY WHEN IT VOTED FOR A RESOLUTION WITH THE SIMPLE TITLE : "A RESOLUTION TO AUTHORIZE THE USE OF UNITED STATES ARMED FORCES AGAINST IRAQ ." I OPPOSED THE WAR , AND SPOKE OUT AGAINST IT IN 2002 WHEN IT WAS NOT POLITICALLY POPULAR . I SAID WE NEEDED TO FINISH THE JOB IN AFGHANISTAN , AND THAT INVADING AND UNKNOWNWORD A COUNTRY THAT HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH 9/11 WAS THE WRONG WAY TO RESPOND TO THE UNCONVENTIONAL CHALLENGE POSED BY AL QAEDA AND ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . TODAY , WE SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD RESULTS OF THE DECISION TO GO TO WAR . STILL , WE HAVE NOT SHOWN THAT WE ARE LEARNING THE RIGHT LESSONS . ON IRAQ , WE HEAR THAT THE SURGE IS SUCCEEDING . LET ME BE CLEAR : THE SURGE IS NOT THE SOLUTION TO IRAQ'S PROBLEMS BECAUSE IT IS NOT ACHIEVING THE POLITICAL BENCHMARKS THAT WERE THE STATED PURPOSE OF OUR TROOP INCREASE . YOU CANNOT END A CIVIL WAR UNLESS THE WARRING PARTIES RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES , AND ONLY A REMOVAL OF OUR COMBAT BRIGADES WILL PUT MEANINGFUL PRESSURE ON THE IRAQIS TO DO SO . AND THE SURGE CONTINUES TO FOCUS OUR RESOURCES ON THE WRONG WAR . JUST YESTERDAY , WE LEARNED ON THE FRONT PAGE OF THE WASHINGTON POST THAT THE U.S . MILITARY IS PRESSING FOR A QUICKER DRAWDOWN FROM IRAQ SO WE CAN SALVAGE STABILITY IN AFGHANISTAN . SIX YEARS AFTER WE TOOK OUR EYE OFF THE BALL IN AFGHANISTAN - THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE 9/11 ATTACKS - WE STILL DON'T HAVE OUR PRIORITIES STRAIGHT . THAT'S WHY IT'S TIME TO STOP FUNDING A FAILED POLICY , TO REMOVE OUR COMBAT BRIGADES FROM IRAQ , AND TO INCREASE OUR MILITARY , POLITICAL , AND ECONOMIC COMMITMENT TO AFGHANISTAN . THAT'S WHAT I SPOKE OUT FOR IN 2002 , THAT'S WHAT I'VE CALLED FOR IN THIS CAMPAIGN , AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . IN IRAN , THERE IS A CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT HAS PRIZED BLUSTER OVER COMMON SENSE . EARLIER THIS YEAR , WHILE I WAS GETTING ATTACKED FOR CALLING FOR DIRECT DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN'S LEADERS , OTHERS WERE TALKING TOUGH AND VOTING FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT CALLS FOR GEORGE BUSH TO USE OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ TO COUNTER IRAN . THEN WE LEARNED IN A NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE THAT IRAN SUSPENDED ITS NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IN 2003 IN RESPONSE TO INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE . NOW MAKE NO MISTAKE - IRAN CONTINUES TO POSE A THREAT THROUGH ITS SUPPORT FOR TERRORISM , NUCLEAR KNOW-HOW , AND THREATS TOWARD ISRAEL . BUT THE ANSWER IS NOT GEORGE BUSH'S SABER-RATTLING - IT'S THE DIPLOMATIC APPROACH THAT I PUT FORWARD WHEN IT WAS POLITICALLY RISKY . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL PERSONALLY PRESENT IRAN WITH A CHOICE - STOP YOUR DANGEROUS BEHAVIOR AND THERE WILL BE POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC INCENTIVES ; CONTINUE DOING WHAT YOU'RE DOING AND YOU WILL FACE FURTHER ISOLATION . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO TALK TO ALL NATIONS - FRIEND AND FOE . NOT TALKING DOESN'T MAKE US LOOK TOUGH , IT MAKES US LOOK ARROGANT . IT ALSO MAKES IT HARDER TO GET INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT WHEN WE DO NEED TO PRESSURE COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN , AND OPENS THE DOOR TO CHINA AND RUSSIA TO FILL THE VACUUM LEFT BY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . WE HAVE TO STOP GIVING COUNTRIES THE EXCUSE THAT AMERICA WILL NOT COME TO THE TABLE . WE HAVE TO LEAD , AND THAT'S WHAT I INTEND TO DO . WHEN YOU ELECT OUR NEXT PRESIDENT , YOU WILL CHOOSE SOMEONE TO MAKE THOSE TOUGH JUDGMENTS ON IRAQ , ON IRAN , ON HOW TO RESTORE AMERICA'S STANDING . WE KNOW WHAT WE'RE GOING TO GET FROM THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE . MORE BUSH-CHENEY FOREIGN POLICY . MORE SUPPORT FOR OPEN-ENDED WAR IN IRAQ . MORE SABER-RATTLING TOWARD IRAN . MORE REFUSING TO TALK TO COUNTRIES WE DON'T LIKE . MORE EXCEPTIONS AND EXCUSES MADE FOR TORTURE . THEY EVEN HAD A DEBATE EARLIER THIS YEAR WHERE THEY ARGUED ABOUT HOW MUCH TO EXPAND GUANTANAMO . WHEN I'M THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINEE , I WILL OFFER A CLEAR CHOICE . MY OPPONENT WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I EVER SUPPORTED THE WAR IN IRAQ , OR THAT I DON'T SUPPORT A CLEAR TIMETABLE TO BRING OUR TROOPS HOME . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I VOTED TO USE OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ TO COUNTER IRAN , OR THAT I SUPPORT THE BUSH-CHENEY DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING TO LEADERS WE DON'T LIKE . AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAVERED ON SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OK FOR AMERICA TO TORTURE UNKNOWNWORD IT IS NEVER OK . THIS ISN'T ABOUT DRAWING UNKNOWNWORD - IT'S ABOUT A CHANGE IN OUR FOREIGN POLICY THAT YOU CAN BELIEVE IN . SO WHEN YOU CONSIDER WHO TO CAUCUS FOR , I ASK YOU TO CONSIDER MY JUDGMENT AND VISION FOR NEW AMERICAN LEADERSHIP . LEADERSHIP THAT BRINGS OUR COMBAT BRIGADES OUT OF IRAQ IN 16 MONTHS , RENEWS AMERICAN DIPLOMACY , FINISHES THE FIGHT IN AFGHANISTAN , CLOSES GUANTANAMO , AND LEADS THE WORLD AGAINST THE COMMON THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY - NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORISM ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND DISEASE . LEADERSHIP THAT SENDS A MESSAGE TO THOSE YEARNING FACES BEYOND OUR SHORES THAT SAYS , "YOU MATTER TO US . YOUR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND OUR MOMENT IS NOW ." IT'S A VISION INFORMED BY THREE YEARS SERVING ON THE SENATE FOREIGN RELATIONS COMMITTEE , WHERE I HAVE WORKED ACROSS THE AISLE WITH DICK UNKNOWNWORD TO KEEP THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS WEAPONS AWAY FROM TERRORISTS ; AND INTRODUCED LEGISLATION TO STOP THE WAR IN IRAQ AND THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR . IT'S A VISION INFORMED BY THREE YEARS SERVING ON THE SENATE VETERANS ' AFFAIRS COMMITTEE , WHERE I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE SACRIFICES OF THOSE WHO BEAR THE BURDEN OF WAR , AND FOUGHT TO GIVE THEM THE CARE , BENEFITS , AND RESPECT THAT THEY HAVE EARNED . IT'S A VISION INFORMED BY OFFICIAL TRAVEL OVERSEAS TO AFRICA ; THROUGHOUT THE MIDDLE EAST ; AND ACROSS THE FORMER SOVIET UNION - WHERE I HAVE SEEN FIRSTHAND THE UNCONVENTIONAL THREATS OF A TERRORIZED CITY AND THE TERRIBLE DANGER OF A LOOSE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ; BUT WHERE I ALSO SAW THE YEARNING IN THE EYES OF THOSE FACES WHO NEED AN AMERICA THAT SPEAKS TO THEIR HOPES , NOT JUST THEIR FEARS . IT'S A VISION INFORMED BY MY OPPOSITION TO THIS WAR IN IRAQ , AND BY THE COUNSEL I HAVE RECEIVED FROM LEADING EXPERTS LIKE THE PEOPLE ON THIS STAGE TODAY . AND IT'S A VISION INFORMED BY KNOWING WHAT IT'S LIKE TO LIVE IN THE WIDER WORLD , BEYOND THE HALLS OF POWER ; OF PLAYING UNKNOWNWORD WITH CHILDREN IN INDONESIA WHO COULDN'T DREAM THE SAME DREAMS THAT I COULD BECAUSE THEY WEREN'T AMERICAN ; OF HAVING A GRANDMOTHER LIVING IN KENYA WITHOUT ELECTRICITY OR PLUMBING ; OF BEING BORN TO A FATHER WHO SET OUT FROM A DISTANT LAND IN SEARCH OF THE LIGHT OF HOPE OFFERED BY A DREAM CALLED AMERICA . THAT IS THE EXPERIENCE THAT I WILL BRING TO THE OFFICE . NOT THE MINDSET OF FEAR THAT WE HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD SINCE 9/11 - FEAR OF LOOKING WEAK ; FEAR OF NEW CHALLENGES ; FEAR OF THE UNKNOWN . BUT RATHER HOPE THAT THIS MOMENT OF CHALLENGE CAN BECOME A DAWN OF NEW OPPORTUNITY , AND THE CONVICTION TO SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY - TO RECAPTURE OUR STRENGTH ; TO OVERCOME NEW THREATS ; TO REACH FOR WHAT'S POSSIBLE . TO DO THIS , WE HAVE TO INVITE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE INTO THE DISCUSSION , AND ONCE MORE MAKE OUR FOREIGN POLICY A CAUSE TO UNITE US - NOT A WEDGE ISSUE TO DIVIDE US . THAT'S WHY I HAVE BEEN CLEAR AND DETAILED IN MY PROPOSALS DURING THIS CAMPAIGN . AND THAT'S WHY I'M PLEASED TO JOIN SOME OF MY ADVISORS IN AN OPEN DISCUSSION WITH IOWANS TODAY .
BLUE	 IT IS AN HONOR TO BE INTRODUCED BY HARRIS WOFFORD - ONE OF AMERICA'S GREATEST ADVOCATES FOR PUBLIC SERVICE . STARTING WITH THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT AND THE PEACE CORPS , HARRIS AND A GENERATION OF AMERICANS ANSWERED A CALL TO SERVICE . AT A PIVOTAL MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY , THEY STOOD UP ; THEY CHANGED AMERICA ; AND THEY CHANGED THE WORLD . TODAY , IT'S EASY FOR US TO GET CAUGHT THINKING THAT THERE ARE TWO DIFFERENT STORIES AT WORK IN OUR LIVES . THERE IS THE STORY OF OUR DAY TO DAY CARES AND RESPONSIBILITIES . AND THERE IS THE STORY OF WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE WIDER WORLD - A STORY UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH HEADLINES AND WEBSITES , A DESTINY TO BE SHAPED BY FORCES BEYOND OUR CONTROL . I AM HERE TODAY TO ASK YOU TO REJECT THIS NOTION , AND TO INVITE YOU TO TAKE HOLD OF THE FUTURE OF YOUR COUNTRY . BECAUSE YOUR OWN STORY AND THE AMERICAN STORY ARE NOT SEPARATE - THEY ARE SHARED . AND THEY WILL BOTH BE ENRICHED IF WE STAND UP TOGETHER , AND ANSWER A NEW CALL TO SERVICE TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF OUR NEW CENTURY . I SAY THIS TO YOU AS SOMEONE WHOSE PRESENCE ON THIS STAGE IS UNLIKELY . MY FATHER CAME FROM THOUSANDS OF MILES AWAY , IN KENYA , AND WENT BACK THERE SOON AFTER I WAS BORN . I SPENT A CHILDHOOD ADRIFT . I WAS RAISED IN HAWAII AND INDONESIA . I LIVED WITH MY SINGLE MOM AND WITH MY GRANDPARENTS FROM KANSAS . GROWING UP , I WASN'T ALWAYS SURE WHO I WAS , OR WHERE I WAS GOING . THEN , WHEN I WAS ABOUT YOUR AGE , I DECIDED TO BECOME A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER . I WROTE LETTERS TO EVERY ORGANIZATION IN THE COUNTRY THAT I COULD THINK OF . AND FOR A WHILE , I GOT NO RESPONSE . FINALLY , THIS SMALL GROUP OF CHURCHES ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO WROTE BACK AND OFFERED ME A JOB TO COME HELP NEIGHBORHOODS DEVASTATED BY STEEL-PLANT CLOSINGS . MY MOTHER AND GRANDPARENTS WANTED ME TO GO TO LAW SCHOOL . MY FRIENDS WERE APPLYING TO JOBS ON WALL STREET . I DIDN'T KNOW A SOUL IN CHICAGO , AND THE SALARY WAS ABOUT $12,000 A YEAR , PLUS $2,000 TO BUY AN OLD , BEAT-UP CAR . I STILL REMEMBER A CONVERSATION I HAD WITH AN OLDER MAN BEFORE I LEFT . HE LOOKED AND SAID , UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL GIVE YOU A BIT OF ADVICE . FORGET THIS COMMUNITY ORGANIZING BUSINESS AND DO SOMETHING THAT'S GONNA MAKE YOU SOME MONEY . YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE WORLD , AND PEOPLE WON'T APPRECIATE YOU TRYING . YOU'VE GOT A NICE VOICE . WHAT YOU SHOULD DO IS GO INTO TELEVISION BROADCASTING . I'M TELLING YOU , YOU'VE GOT A FUTURE ." NOW , HE MAY HAVE HAD A POINT ABOUT THE TV THING . AND TO TELL YOU THE TRUTH , I DIDN'T HAVE A CLEAR ANSWER ABOUT WHAT I WAS DOING . I WANTED TO STEP INTO THE CURRENTS OF HISTORY AND HELP PEOPLE FIGHT FOR THEIR DREAMS , BUT DIDN'T KNOW WHAT MY ROLE WOULD BE . I WAS INSPIRED BY WHAT PEOPLE LIKE HARRIS DID IN THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , BUT WHEN I GOT TO CHICAGO , THERE WERE NO MARCHES , NO SOARING SPEECHES . IN THE SHADOW OF AN EMPTY STEEL PLANT , THERE WERE JUST A LOT OF FOLKS STRUGGLING . DAY AFTER DAY , I HEARD .NO ' A LOT MORE THAN I HEARD .YES .' I SAW PLENTY OF EMPTY CHAIRS IN THOSE MEETINGS WE PUT TOGETHER . BUT EVEN AS I DISCOVERED THAT YOU CAN'T BEND HISTORY TO YOUR WILL , I FOUND THAT YOU COULD DO YOUR PART TO SEE THAT - IN THE WORDS OF DR . KING - IT "BENDS TOWARD JUSTICE ." IN CHURCH BASEMENTS AND AROUND KITCHEN TABLES , BLOCK BY BLOCK , WE BROUGHT THE COMMUNITY TOGETHER , REGISTERED NEW VOTERS , FOUGHT FOR NEW JOBS , AND HELPED PEOPLE LIVE LIVES WITH SOME MEASURE OF DIGNITY . EVENTUALLY , I REALIZED I WASN'T JUST HELPING OTHER PEOPLE . THROUGH SERVICE , I FOUND A COMMUNITY THAT EMBRACED ME ; A CHURCH TO BELONG TO ; CITIZENSHIP THAT WAS MEANINGFUL ; THE DIRECTION I'D BEEN SEEKING . THROUGH SERVICE , I FOUND THAT MY OWN IMPROBABLE STORY FIT INTO A LARGER AMERICAN STORY . IN AMERICA , EACH OF US SEEKS OUR OWN DREAMS , BUT THE SUM OF THOSE DREAMS MUST BE GREATER THAN OURSELVES . BECAUSE THE AMERICA WE INHERITED IS THE LEGACY OF THOSE WHO STRUGGLED , AND THOSE WHO SERVED IN SO MANY WAYS , BEFORE US . IT'S THE LEGACY OF A BAND OF UNLIKELY PATRIOTS WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE TYRANNY OF A KING . IT'S THE LEGACY OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO STOOD UP , AND SOLDIERS WHO FOUGHT FOR A MORE PERFECT UNION . IT'S THE LEGACY OF THOSE WHO STARTED TO TEACH IN OUR SCHOOLS AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SICK IN OUR CITIES ; WHO LAID THE RAILS AND VOLUNTEERED TO UPHOLD THE LAW AS AMERICA MOVED WEST . IT'S THE LEGACY OF MEN WHO FACED THE DEPRESSION BY PUTTING ON THE UNIFORM OF THE CIVILIAN CONSERVATION CORPS ; OF WOMEN WHO WORKED ON THAT ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY AND BUILT THE TANKS AND SHIPS AND BOMBER AIRCRAFT TO FIGHT FASCISM . IT'S THE LEGACY OF THOSE WOMEN'S SUFFRAGISTS AND FREEDOM UNKNOWNWORD WHO STOOD UP FOR JUSTICE ; AND YOUNG PEOPLE WHO ANSWERED PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S CALL TO GO FORTH IN A PEACE CORPS . THE SACRIFICES MADE BY PREVIOUS GENERATIONS HAVE NEVER BEEN EASY . BUT AMERICA IS A GREAT NATION PRECISELY BECAUSE AMERICANS HAVE BEEN WILLING TO STAND UP WHEN IT WAS HARD ; TO SERVE ON UNKNOWNWORD BOTH GREAT AND SMALL ; TO RISE ABOVE MOMENTS OF GREAT CHALLENGE AND TERRIBLE TRIAL . ONE OF THOSE MOMENTS TOOK PLACE ON SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 . WHETHER YOU LIVED IN MANHATTAN OR HERE IN MOUNT VERNON , YOU FELT THE PAIN AND LOSS OF THAT DAY NOT JUST AS AN INDIVIDUAL , BUT AS AN AMERICAN . THAT'S WHY WE LINED UP TO GIVE BLOOD . THAT'S WHY WE HELD VIGILS AND UNKNOWNWORD FLAGS . THAT'S WHY WE RALLIED BEHIND OUR PRESIDENT . WE HAD A CHANCE TO STEP INTO THE CURRENTS OF HISTORY . WE WERE READY TO ANSWER A NEW CALL FOR OUR COUNTRY . BUT THE CALL NEVER CAME . INSTEAD , WE WERE ASKED TO GO SHOPPING , AND TO PROVE OUR PATRIOTISM BY SUPPORTING A WAR IN IRAQ THAT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED , AND NEVER BEEN WAGED . WE HAVE LOST PRECIOUS TIME . OUR NATION IS LESS SECURE AND LESS RESPECTED IN THE WORLD . OUR ENERGY DEPENDENCE HAS RISEN , AND SO HAS THE SPECTER OF CLIMATE CHANGE . MORE OF OUR CHILDREN HAVE BEEN LEFT BEHIND . INSTEAD OF A CALL TO UNITY , WE GOT A POLITICAL STRATEGY OF DIVISION . THE BURDEN OF SERVICE HAS FALLEN , MORE AND MORE , ON THE BRAVE MEN AND WOMEN OF OUR MILITARY WHO HEROICALLY SERVE TOUR AFTER TOUR OF DUTY IN A WAR WITHOUT END . WHEN I WAS THINKING ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO SEEK THE PRESIDENCY , THERE WERE SOME VOICES WHO COUNSELED ME TO WAIT . YOU SEEM LIKE A GIFTED YOUNG MAN , THEY SAID - WHY NOT WAIT AROUND WASHINGTON A FEW MORE YEARS ? OR WHEN I STARTED TALKING ABOUT A POLITICS OF HOPE , SOME JUST UNKNOWNWORD THEIR EYES AND ECHOED THE WORDS OF THAT MAN FROM MY YOUNGER DAYS : YOU CAN'T CHANGE THE WORLD , AND PEOPLE WON'T APPRECIATE YOU TRYING . WELL I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT - RIGHT NOW - BECAUSE I REFUSE TO LET THIS MOMENT PASS . THE DECISIONS WE MAKE TODAY WILL SHAPE THE CENTURY THAT MY DAUGHTERS - AND YOUR CHILDREN - GROW UP IN . I HAVE NOT SERVED THE CAUSE OF AMERICA FOR OVER TWO DECADES TO STAY ON THE SIDELINES AT A TIME WHEN THAT CAUSE IS BEING CHALLENGED AT HOME AND ABROAD . IF WE DON'T RISE UP TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT , THEN WE MAY NOT GET ANOTHER . I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT IN THE FACE OF IMPOSSIBLE ODDS PEOPLE WHO LOVE THEIR COUNTRY CAN CHANGE IT . BUT I HOLD NO ILLUSIONS THAT ONE MAN OR WOMAN CAN DO THIS ALONE . THAT'S WHY MY CAMPAIGN HAS CALLED NEARLY 400,000 AMERICANS TO A COMMON PURPOSE . THAT'S WHY I'M REACHING OUT TO DEMOCRATS , AND ALSO TO INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS . AND THAT IS WHY I WON'T JUST ASK FOR YOUR VOTE AS A CANDIDATE ; I WILL ASK FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR ACTIVE CITIZENSHIP WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . THIS WILL NOT BE A CALL ISSUED IN ONE SPEECH OR PROGRAM ; THIS WILL BE A CAUSE OF MY PRESIDENCY . FIRST , WE WILL CREATE NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR ALL AMERICANS TO SERVE , AND TO DIRECT THAT SERVICE TO OUR MOST PRESSING NATIONAL CHALLENGES . AMERICANS HAVE SHOWN THEY WANT TO STEP UP . I SEE IT EVERYWHERE I GO : THE BRAVE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO HAVE SIGNED UP TO DEFEND OUR COUNTRY ; THE VOLUNTEERS FIGHTING POVERTY IN RURAL AMERICA AND TO REBUILD NEW ORLEANS ; STUDENTS GETTING THEIR COLLEGES TO UNKNOWNWORD TO STOP THE GENOCIDE IN DARFUR ; THE THOUSANDS OF YOUNG AMERICANS WHO HAVE FLOODED THE APPLICANT POOL FOR TEACH FOR AMERICA ; RETIREES WHO ARE DEVOTING THEIR TIME TO SERVE . BUT WE'RE NOT KEEPING PACE WITH THE DEMAND OF THOSE WHO WANT TO SERVE , AND WE'RE NOT LEVERAGING THAT COMMITMENT TO MEET NATIONAL CHALLENGES . FDR NOT ONLY ENLISTED AMERICANS TO CREATE EMPLOYMENT , HE TARGETED THAT SERVICE TO BUILD OUR INFRASTRUCTURE AND CONSERVE OUR ENVIRONMENT . JFK NOT ONLY CALLED ON A NEW GENERATION , HE MADE THEIR SERVICE A BRIDGE TO THE DEVELOPING WORLD , AND A BRIGHT LIGHT OF AMERICAN VALUES IN THE DARKEST DAYS OF THE COLD WAR . TODAY , AMERICORPS - OUR NATION'S NETWORK OF LOCAL , STATE AND NATIONAL SERVICE PROGRAMS - HAS 75,000 SLOTS . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL INCREASE THAT TO 250,000 , AND MAKE THAT INCREASED SERVICE A VEHICLE TO MEET NATIONAL GOALS LIKE PROVIDING HEALTH CARE AND EDUCATION , SAVING OUR PLANET AND RESTORING OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD , SO THAT CITIZENS SEE THEIR EFFORTS CONNECTED TO A COMMON PURPOSE . PEOPLE OF ALL AGES , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SKILLS WILL BE ASKED TO SERVE . BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM - THEY ARE THE ANSWER . TO HELP EVERY AMERICAN RECEIVE A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION , WE WILL CREATE A NEW CLASSROOM CORPS . WE'LL HAVE COLLEGE STUDENTS , RECENT GRADUATES AND RETIREES MENTOR YOUNG PEOPLE ; ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS WILL HELP MAKE SURE THE NEXT GENERATION OF INNOVATORS IS EDUCATED HERE IN AMERICA ; CIVIC , BUSINESS AND FAITH LEADERS WILL DEVELOP NEW AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS FOR OUR KIDS . TO FREE OURSELVES FROM ENERGY DEPENDENCE AND TO CONFRONT CLIMATE CHANGE , WE WILL CREATE A NEW ENERGY CORPS . WE'LL ASK YOU TO WORK ON RENEWABLE ENERGY PROJECTS , TO TEACH FOLKS ABOUT CONSERVATION , AND TO HELP CLEAN UP POLLUTED AREAS . AND WE'LL SEND TALENTED AMERICAN ENGINEERS AND SCIENTISTS ABROAD TO HELP DEVELOPING COUNTRIES PROMOTE LOW-CARBON ENERGY DEVELOPMENT . TO RESTORE AMERICA'S STANDING , I WILL CALL ON OUR GREATEST RESOURCE - NOT OUR BOMBS , GUNS , OR DOLLARS - I WILL CALL UPON OUR PEOPLE . WE WILL GROW THE FOREIGN SERVICE TO RENEW OUR COMMITMENT TO DIPLOMACY . WE WILL DOUBLE THE SIZE OF THE PEACE CORPS BY ITS 50TH ANNIVERSARY IN 2011 . AND WE'LL REACH OUT TO OTHER NATIONS TO ENGAGE THEIR YOUNG PEOPLE IN SIMILAR PROGRAMS , SO THAT WE WORK SIDE BY SIDE TO TAKE ON THE COMMON CHALLENGES THAT CONFRONT ALL HUMANITY . I WILL EXPAND OUR MILITARY , WHILE OFFERING THOSE WHO SERVE THE PROMISE THAT THEY WILL GET THE TRAINING , EQUIPMENT , AND CARE THEY DESERVE - AND THAT THEY CAN TRUST WE WILL NEVER , EVER , SEND THEM TO FIGHT IN A MISGUIDED WAR . AND WE'LL ENLIST VETERANS TO HELP OTHER VETERANS FIND JOBS ; TO COUNSEL VETS WHO ARE CONFRONTING HOMELESSNESS , MENTAL HEALTH AND SUBSTANCE ABUSE PROBLEMS ; AND TO PITCH IN AT VA HOSPITALS AND NURSING HOMES . SOME OF THESE PROGRAMS WILL BE FULL-TIME ; SOME WILL BE PART TIME OPPORTUNITIES FOR THOSE WHO ARE WORKING . AND WE'LL EXPAND AND IMPROVE SENIOR CORPS PROGRAMS TO ATTRACT NEW RETIREES WITH SUBSTANTIVE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES , SO THAT SERVICE BECOMES A CORE PART OF ACTIVE RETIREMENT AND WE'LL USE TECHNOLOGY TO CONNECT PEOPLE TO SERVICE MORE EXTENSIVELY AND EFFECTIVELY . WE TURN TO WEBSITES LIKE CRAIGSLIST TO FIND APARTMENTS AND JOBS . SO WE'LL EXPAND USA FREEDOM CORPS TO CREATE AN ONLINE NETWORK WHERE AMERICANS CAN BROWSE OPPORTUNITIES TO VOLUNTEER . YOU'LL BE ABLE TO SEARCH BY CATEGORY , TIME COMMITMENT , AND SKILL SETS ; YOU'LL BE ABLE TO RATE SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES , BUILD SERVICE NETWORKS , AND CREATE YOUR OWN SERVICE PAGES TO TRACK YOUR HOURS AND ACTIVITIES . THIS WILL EMPOWER MORE AMERICANS TO CRAFT THEIR OWN SERVICE AGENDA , AND MAKE THEIR OWN CHANGE FROM THE BOTTOM UP . THE SECOND THING I'LL DO IS INVEST IN IDEAS THAT CAN HELP US MEET OUR COMMON CHALLENGES , BECAUSE MORE OFTEN THAN NOT THE NEXT GREAT SOCIAL INNOVATION WON'T BE UNKNOWNWORD BY THE GOVERNMENT . THE NON-PROFIT SECTOR UNKNOWNWORD 1 IN 12 AMERICANS AND 115 UNKNOWNWORD ARE LAUNCHED EVERY DAY . YET WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT INVESTS $7 BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT FOR THE PRIVATE SECTOR , THERE IS NO SIMILAR EFFORT TO SUPPORT NON-PROFIT INNOVATION . MEANWHILE , THERE ARE IDEAS ACROSS AMERICA - IN OUR INNER CITIES AND SMALL TOWNS ; FROM COLLEGE GRADUATES TO FOLKS MAKING A CAREER CHANGE - THAT COULD BENEFIT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS IF THEY'RE GIVEN THE CHANCE TO GROW . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LAUNCH A NEW SOCIAL INVESTMENT FUND NETWORK . IT'S TIME TO GET THE GRASS ROOTS , THE FOUNDATIONS , THE PRIVATE SECTOR AND THE GOVERNMENT AT THE TABLE . WE'LL INVEST IN IDEAS THAT WORK ; LEVERAGE PRIVATE SECTOR DOLLARS TO ENCOURAGE INNOVATION ; AND EXPAND SUCCESSFUL PROGRAMS TO SCALE . TAKE A PROGRAM LIKE THE HARLEM CHILDREN'S ZONE , WHICH HELPS THOUSANDS OF KIDS IN NEW YORK THROUGH AFTER-SCHOOL ACTIVITIES , MENTORING , AND FAMILY SUPPORT . WE NEED TO MAKE THAT MODEL WORK IN DIFFERENT CITIES AROUND THE COUNTRY . AND I'LL START A NEW SOCIAL ENTREPRENEUR AGENCY TO MAKE SURE THAT SMALL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE THE SAME KIND OF SUPPORT THAT WE GIVE SMALL BUSINESSES . THE THIRD PART OF MY PLAN WILL BE INTEGRATING SERVICE INTO EDUCATION , SO THAT YOUNG AMERICANS ARE CALLED UPON AND PREPARED TO BE ACTIVE CITIZENS . JUST AS WE TEACH MATH AND WRITING , ARTS AND ATHLETICS , WE NEED TO TEACH YOUNG AMERICANS TO TAKE CITIZENSHIP SERIOUSLY . STUDY AFTER STUDY SHOWS THAT STUDENTS WHO SERVE DO BETTER IN SCHOOL , ARE MORE LIKELY TO GO TO COLLEGE , AND MORE LIKELY TO MAINTAIN THAT SERVICE AS ADULTS . SO WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , I WILL SET A GOAL FOR ALL AMERICAN MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL STUDENTS TO PERFORM 50 HOURS OF SERVICE A YEAR , AND FOR ALL COLLEGE STUDENTS TO PERFORM 100 HOURS OF SERVICE A YEAR . THIS MEANS THAT BY THE TIME YOU GRADUATE COLLEGE , YOU'LL HAVE DONE 17 WEEKS OF SERVICE . WE'LL REACH THIS GOAL IN SEVERAL WAYS . AT THE MIDDLE AND HIGH SCHOOL LEVEL , WE'LL MAKE FEDERAL ASSISTANCE CONDITIONAL ON SCHOOL DISTRICTS DEVELOPING SERVICE PROGRAMS , AND GIVE SCHOOLS RESOURCES TO OFFER NEW SERVICE OPPORTUNITIES . AT THE COMMUNITY LEVEL , WE'LL DEVELOP PUBLIC-PRIVATE PARTNERSHIPS SO STUDENTS CAN SERVE MORE OUTSIDE THE CLASSROOM . FOR COLLEGE STUDENTS , I HAVE PROPOSED AN ANNUAL AMERICAN OPPORTUNITY TAX CREDIT OF $4,000 TO MAKE TUITION AFFORDABLE . TO RECEIVE THIS CREDIT , WE'LL REQUIRE 100 HOURS OF PUBLIC SERVICE . AND WE'LL AMEND THE FEDERAL UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM , SO THAT NEARLY $250 MILLION WILL HELP MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD COLLEGE STUDENTS WORK IN PART-TIME PUBLIC SERVICE JOBS EACH YEAR . AND WE WILL NOT LEAVE OUT THE NEARLY 2 MILLION YOUNG AMERICANS WHO ARE OUT OF SCHOOL AND OUT OF WORK . INSTEAD , WE'LL USE SERVICE TO TIGHTEN THEIR BOND TO THE AMERICAN FAMILY , AND TO PUT THEM ON A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS . WE'LL ENLIST THEM IN A GREEN JOB CORPS , SO THAT DISADVANTAGED YOUNG PEOPLE CAN FIND USEFUL WORK AND GAIN SKILLS IN A GROWING INDUSTRY . AND WE'LL EXPAND THE YOUTHBUILD PROGRAM , WHICH PUTS YOUNG AMERICANS TO WORK BUILDING AFFORDABLE HOUSING IN AMERICA'S POOREST COMMUNITIES , GIVING THEM VALUABLE SKILLS AND A CHANCE TO COMPLETE A HIGH SCHOOL EDUCATION . TODAY , THERE ARE 8,000 YOUTHBUILD SLOTS - WE'LL EXPAND THAT TO 50,000 . NOW I KNOW WHAT THE CYNICS WILL SAY . I'VE HEARD FROM THEM ALL MY LIFE . THESE ARE THE VOICES THAT WILL TELL YOU - NOT JUST WHAT YOU CAN'T DO - BUT WHAT YOU WON'T DO . AMERICANS WON'T COME TOGETHER - OUR ALLEGIANCE DOESN'T GO BEYOND OUR POLITICAL PARTY , REGION , OR CONGREGATION . YOUNG AMERICANS WON'T SERVE THEIR COUNTRY - THEY'RE TOO SELFISH , OR TOO LAZY . THIS IS THE SOFT SELL OF THE STATUS QUO , THE VOICE THAT TELLS YOU TO SETTLE BECAUSE SETTLING ISN'T THAT BAD . LET ME ASK YOU TO STOP AND CONSIDER THIS MEETING THAT WE'RE HAVING . YOU GO TO THE FIRST SCHOOL IN THE UNITED STATES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI TO GRANT WOMEN THE SAME RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES AS MEN . YOU GO TO A SCHOOL THAT RESOLVED IN 1870 THAT RACE WOULD NOT BE A FACTOR IN ADMISSION . THESE MAY BE SMALL CHANGES ON THE VAST CANVAS OF HISTORY , BUT THE AMERICA WE LIVE IN IS THE SUM TOTAL OF THAT KIND OF COURAGE , THAT SPIRIT OF PROGRESS . IF IT WEREN'T FOR THAT KIND OF CHANGE , IT WOULDN'T BE POSSIBLE FOR SOMEONE LIKE ME TO STAND HERE TODAY TO TALK TO YOU ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY . YOU AND I ARE AT A PLACE WHERE SOMEBODY , AT SOME POINT , DECIDED THAT LOVING THEIR COMMUNITY AND THEIR COUNTRY MEANT DOING SOMETHING TO CHANGE IT . RENEWING THAT SPIRIT STARTS WITH SERVICE . MAKE NO MISTAKE : OUR DESTINY AS AMERICANS IS TIED UP WITH ONE ANOTHER . IF WE ARE LESS RESPECTED IN THE WORLD , THEN YOU WILL BE LESS SAFE . IF WE KEEP PAYING DICTATORS TO FILL UP OUR GAS TANKS , THEN THOSE OCEANS ARE GOING TO RISE . IF WE CAN'T GIVE OUR KIDS A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION , THEN OUR ECONOMY IS GOING TO FALL BEHIND . AND THAT'S HOW IT SHOULD BE . IT IS TIME TO RECAPTURE THAT SENSE OF A COMMON PURPOSE : I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER , I AM MY SISTER'S KEEPER . I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT HOW AMERICA IS ON THE WRONG TRACK - I WANT US TO COME TOGETHER TO PUT IT ON THE RIGHT TRACK . I'M TIRED OF HEARING ABOUT RED AMERICA AND BLUE AMERICA - I WANT TO LEAD A UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . I'M TIRED OF TALKING ABOUT WHAT WE CAN'T DO , OR WON'T DO , OR WON'T EVEN TRY - I WANT ALL OF US TO STAND UP AND TO START REACHING FOR WHAT IS POSSIBLE . THAT'S WHAT HISTORY CALLS US TO DO . BECAUSE LOVING YOUR COUNTRY SHOULDN'T JUST MEAN WATCHING FIREWORKS ON THE 4TH OF JULY ; LOVING YOUR COUNTRY MUST MEAN ACCEPTING YOUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO YOUR PART TO CHANGE IT . AND IF YOU DO STAND UP , I PROMISE YOU THAT YOUR LIFE WILL BE RICHER , AND OUR COUNTRY WILL BE STRONGER . WE NEED YOUR SERVICE , RIGHT NOW , IN THIS MOMENT - OUR MOMENT - IN HISTORY . I'M NOT GOING TO TELL YOU WHAT YOUR ROLE SHOULD BE ; THAT'S FOR YOU TO DISCOVER . BUT I AM GOING TO ASK YOU TO PLAY YOUR PART ; ASK YOU TO STAND UP ; ASK YOU TO PUT YOUR FOOT FIRMLY INTO THE CURRENT OF HISTORY . I AM ASKING YOU TO CHANGE HISTORY'S COURSE . AND IF I HAVE THE FORTUNE TO BE YOUR PRESIDENT , DECADES FROM NOW - WHEN THE MEMORY OF THIS OR THAT POLICY HAS FADED , AND WHEN THE WORDS THAT WE WILL SPEAK IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS ARE LONG FORGOTTEN - I HOPE YOU REMEMBER THIS AS A MOMENT WHEN YOUR OWN STORY AND THE AMERICAN STORY CAME TOGETHER , AND HISTORY BENT ONCE MORE IN THE DIRECTION OF JUSTICE .
BLUE	LESS THAN A YEAR FROM NOW , YOU WILL GO INTO THE VOTING BOOTH AND YOU WILL SELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . NOW , HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS - THE NAME GEORGE W . BUSH WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . THE NAME OF MY COUSIN DICK CHENEY WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HIDE THAT FOR A LONG TIME . EVERYBODY HAS A BLACK SHEEP IN THE FAMILY . THE ERA OF SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE , AND BROWNIE INCOMPETENCE , AND KARL ROVE POLITICS WILL FINALLY BE OVER . BUT THE QUESTION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU VOTE THIS YEAR AND NEXT IS THIS : "WHAT'S NEXT FOR AMERICA ?" WE ARE IN A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . THE PLANET IS IN PERIL . THE DREAM THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR FEELS AS IF IT'S SLOWLY SLIPPING AWAY . WE ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS . WE'VE NEVER PAID MORE FOR HEALTH CARE OR FOR COLLEGE . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE AND IT'S HARDER TO RETIRE . AND MOST OF ALL WE'VE LOST FAITH THAT OUR LEADERS CAN OR WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . WE WERE PROMISED COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM AND ALL WE GOT WAS KATRINA AND WIRETAPS . WE WERE PROMISED A UNITER , AND WE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO COULD NOT EVEN LEAD THE HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT VOTED FOR HIM . WE WERE PROMISED A MORE ETHICAL AND MORE EFFICIENT WASHINGTON , AND INSTEAD WE HAVE A TOWN THAT IS MORE CORRUPT AND MORE WASTEFUL THAN IT WAS BEFORE . AND THE ONLY MISSION THAT WAS EVER ACCOMPLISHED IS TO USE FEAR AND FALSEHOOD TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY TO A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN WAGED . IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT AMERICA IS LISTENING , INTENTLY , TO WHAT WE SAY HERE TODAY - NOT JUST DEMOCRATS , BUT REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO'VE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT , BUT WANT TO BELIEVE AGAIN . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT WE NOT ONLY HAVE A MOMENT OF GREAT CHALLENGE , BUT ALSO A MOMENT OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY . WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A NEW MAJORITY - TO FINALLY TACKLE PROBLEMS THAT GEORGE BUSH MADE FAR WORSE , BUT THAT HAD FESTERED LONG BEFORE GEORGE BUSH EVER TOOK OFFICE - PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR . AND THAT IS WHY THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON TEXTBOOK CAMPAIGNS JUST WON'T DO IN THIS ELECTION . AN ELECTORAL STRATEGY THAT STARTS OUT LEAVING HALF THE COUNTRY BEHIND JUST WON'T DO . TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR INSTEAD OF TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR JUST WON'T DO . TRIANGULATING AND POLL-DRIVEN POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MITT OR RUDY MIGHT SAY ABOUT US JUST WON'T DO . IF WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WINING THIS ELECTION DEMOCRATS , WE CAN'T LIVE IN FEAR OF LOSING IT . THIS PARTY - THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON AND JACKSON ; OF ROOSEVELT AND KENNEDY - HAS ALWAYS MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE LED , NOT BY POLLS , BUT BY PRINCIPLE ; NOT BY CALCULATION , BUT BY CONVICTION ; WHEN WE SUMMONED THE ENTIRE NATION TO A COMMON PURPOSE - A HIGHER PURPOSE . AND I RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THAT'S THE PARTY AMERICA NEEDS US TO BE RIGHT NOW . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST OFFER CHANGE AS A SLOGAN , BUT REAL , MEANINGFUL CHANGE - CHANGE THAT AMERICA CAN BELIEVE IN . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . I AM IN THIS RACE TO TELL THE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS THAT THEIR DAYS OF SETTING THE AGENDA IN WASHINGTON ARE OVER . I HAVE DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE TO TAKE ON LOBBYISTS - AND WON . THEY HAVE NOT FUNDED MY CAMPAIGN , THEY WILL NOT GET A JOB IN MY WHITE HOUSE , AND THEY WILL NOT DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I'M IN THIS RACE TO TAKE THOSE TAX BREAKS AWAY FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS AND PUT THEM IN THE POCKETS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS WHO DESERVE IT . AND I WON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE EVERY TEN YEARS -I WILL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE SO THAT WORKERS DON'T ' FALL BEHIND . THAT IS WHY I AM IN IT . I'M IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I WANT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE OUTRAGE OF 47 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE AND START ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT . I EXPANDED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS BY BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER . BY TAKING ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . AND I HAVE PUT FORTH A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN THAT WILL DO MORE TO CUT THE COST OF HEALTH CARE THAN ANY OTHER PROPOSAL IN THIS RACE . HERE'S THE TRUTH - IF YOU CAN'T AFFORD HEALTH INSURANCE RIGHT NOW , YOU WILL WHEN I'M PRESIDENT . ANYONE WHO TELLS YOU OTHERWISE IS MORE INTERESTED IN SCORING POINTS THAN SOLVING PROBLEMS . AND I'M IN IT BECAUSE WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF THAT . I RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CHILD HAS THE BEST EDUCATION THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER - FROM THE DAY THEY ARE BORN TO THE DAY THEY GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE . AND I WON'T JUST TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT TEACHERS ARE - AS PRESIDENT I WILL REWARD THEM FOR THEIR GREATNESS - BY RAISING SALARIES AND GIVING THEM MORE SUPPORT . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I AM SICK AND TIRED OF DEMOCRATS THINKING THAT THE ONLY WAY TO LOOK TOUGH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IS BY TALKING , AND ACTING , AND VOTING LIKE GEORGE BUSH REPUBLICANS . WHEN I AM THIS PARTY'S NOMINEE , MY OPPONENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I VOTED FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ ; OR THAT I GAVE GEORGE BUSH THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON IRAN ; OR THAT I SUPPORTED BUSH-CHENEY POLICIES OF NOT TALKING TO LEADERS THAT WE DON'T LIKE . AND HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAVERED ON SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OK FOR AMERICA TO TORTURE - BECAUSE IT IS NEVER OK . THAT'S WHY I AM IN IT . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE WAR IN IRAQ . WE WILL HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME IN SIXTEEN MONTHS . I WILL CLOSE GUANTANAMO . I WILL RESTORE HABEAS CORPUS . I WILL FINISH THE FIGHT AGAINST AL QAEDA . AND I WILL LEAD THE WORLD TO COMBAT THE COMMON THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY - NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORISM ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND DISEASE . AND I WILL SEND ONCE MORE A MESSAGE TO THOSE YEARNING FACES BEYOND OUR SHORES THAT SAYS , "YOU MATTER TO US . YOUR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND OUR MOMENT IS NOW ." AMERICA , OUR MOMENT IS NOW . OUR MOMENT IS NOW . I DON'T WANT TO SPEND 2008 RE-FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHTS THAT WE HAD IN THE 1990S . THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT MITT AND RUDY WANT . THAT'S THEY'RE ONLY HOPE OF WINNING BECAUSE THEY KNOW THAT IF THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT HEALTH CARE , OR ENDING THIS WAR , OR MAKING COLLEGE AFFORDABLE , THEN THEY WILL LOSE . THEY ARE COUNTING ON THE SAME BITTER PARTISANSHIP AND THE SAME ELECTORAL MAP WE'VE HAD FOR FAR TOO LONG . I BELIEVE I CAN TRANSFORM THAT MAP . IN MY SENATE RACE I WON SOME OF THE REDDEST , MOST REPUBLICAN COUNTIES IN ILLINOIS . IN 2006 , WHEN HOUSE AND SENATE CANDIDATES IN STATES LIKE MISSOURI , AND NEBRASKA , AND TENNESSEE , AND VIRGINIA , AND UNKNOWNWORD NEEDED SOMEONE TO COME CAMPAIGN FOR THEM , I WAS THE ONE THEY CALLED . AND I'M ATTRACTING MORE INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS TO OUR CAUSE THAN ANYONE ELSE IN THIS CAMPAIGN . IT'S BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE CAN BUILD THAT NEW MAJORITY - NOT JUST TO WIN , BUT TO GOVERN - TO ACTUALLY GET SOMETHING DONE . I DON'T WANT TO PIT RED AMERICA AGAINST BLUE AMERICA , I WANT TO BE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AND THAT WON'T JUST BE A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ; THAT WILL BE AN AMERICAN VICTORY . AND THAT IS A VICTORY AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW . I AM NOT IN THIS RACE TO FULFILL SOME LONG-HELD AMBITIONS OR BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S SOMEHOW OWED TO ME . I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE , I ALWAYS KNEW THIS JOURNEY WAS IMPROBABLE . I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A JOURNEY THAT WASN'T . I AM RUNNING IN THIS RACE BECAUSE OF WHAT DR . KING CALLED "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW ." BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO LATE . AND THAT HOUR IS ALMOST UPON US . I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND FIND OUT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STILL LACK HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT THE OCEANS HAVE RISEN A FEW MORE INCHES . THE PLANET HAS REACHED A POINT OF NO RETURN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO STOP BUYING OIL FROM DICTATORS . I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE AMERICAN LIVES PUT AT RISK BECAUSE NO ONE HAD THE JUDGMENT OR THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST A MISGUIDED WAR BEFORE WE SENT OUR TROOPS INTO FIGHT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE HOMELESS VETERANS ON THE STREETS . I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANOTHER GENERATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN TO FAILING SCHOOLS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR MY DAUGHTERS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR YOUR SONS . I DO NOT WANT THAT FUTURE FOR AMERICA . I'M IN THIS RACE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR JOBS FOR THE JOBLESS AND HOPE FOR THE HOPELESS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO ; FOR THE SAME REASON I FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER ; FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR ILLINOIS FAMILIES FOR OVER A DECADE . BECAUSE I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M STANDING HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE SOMEBODY , SOMEWHERE STOOD UP FOR ME WHEN IT WAS RISKY . STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS HARD . STOOD UP WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR . AND BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY STOOD UP , A FEW MORE STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW THOUSAND STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW MILLION STOOD UP . AND STANDING UP , WITH COURAGE AND CLEAR PURPOSE , THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CHANGE THE WORLD . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING , DEMOCRATS - TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THE SAME CHANCES SOMEBODY GAVE ME . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING - TO KEEP THE AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE FOR THOSE WHO STILL HUNGER FOR OPPORTUNITY , WHO STILL THIRST FOR EQUALITY . THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND WITH ME , THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO VOTE FOR ME , THAT'S WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO STOP SETTLING FOR WHAT THE CYNICS SAY WE HAVE TO ACCEPT . IN THIS ELECTION - IN THIS MOMENT - LET US REACH FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE . A NATION HEALED . A WORLD REPAIRED . AN AMERICA THAT BELIEVES AGAIN . THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY .
BLUE	GOOD AFTERNOON . LET ME BEGIN BY SAYING THAT ALTHOUGH THIS HAS BEEN BILLED AS AN UNKNOWNWORD RALLY , I STAND BEFORE YOU AS SOMEONE WHO IS NOT OPPOSED TO WAR IN ALL CIRCUMSTANCES . THE CIVIL WAR WAS ONE OF THE BLOODIEST IN HISTORY , AND YET IT WAS ONLY THROUGH THE CRUCIBLE OF THE SWORD , THE SACRIFICE OF MULTITUDES , THAT WE COULD BEGIN TO PERFECT THIS UNION , AND DRIVE THE SCOURGE OF SLAVERY FROM OUR SOIL . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . MY GRANDFATHER SIGNED UP FOR A WAR THE DAY AFTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS BOMBED , FOUGHT IN PATTON'S ARMY . HE SAW THE DEAD AND UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE FIELDS OF EUROPE ; HE HEARD THE STORIES OF FELLOW TROOPS WHO FIRST ENTERED AUSCHWITZ AND UNKNOWNWORD . HE FOUGHT IN THE NAME OF A LARGER FREEDOM , PART OF THAT ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY THAT TRIUMPHED OVER EVIL , AND HE DID NOT FIGHT IN VAIN . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH , AFTER WITNESSING THE CARNAGE AND DESTRUCTION , THE DUST AND THE TEARS , I SUPPORTED THIS ADMINISTRATION'S PLEDGE TO HUNT DOWN AND ROOT OUT THOSE WHO WOULD SLAUGHTER INNOCENTS IN THE NAME OF INTOLERANCE , AND I WOULD WILLINGLY TAKE UP ARMS MYSELF TO PREVENT SUCH TRAGEDY FROM HAPPENING AGAIN . I DON'T OPPOSE ALL WARS . AND I KNOW THAT IN THIS CROWD TODAY , THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF PATRIOTS , OR OF PATRIOTISM . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS A DUMB WAR . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS A RASH WAR . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS THE CYNICAL ATTEMPT BY RICHARD PERLE AND UNKNOWNWORD WOLFOWITZ AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , WEEKEND WARRIORS IN THIS ADMINISTRATION TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR OWN IDEOLOGICAL AGENDAS DOWN OUR UNKNOWNWORD , IRRESPECTIVE OF THE COSTS IN LIVES LOST AND IN HARDSHIPS UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT I AM OPPOSED TO IS THE ATTEMPT BY POLITICAL HACKS LIKE KARL ROVE TO DISTRACT US FROM A RISE IN THE UNINSURED , A RISE IN THE POVERTY RATE , A DROP IN THE MEDIAN INCOME - TO DISTRACT US FROM CORPORATE SCANDALS AND A STOCK MARKET THAT HAS JUST GONE THROUGH THE WORST MONTH SINCE THE GREAT DEPRESSION . THAT'S WHAT I'M OPPOSED TO . A DUMB WAR . A RASH WAR . A WAR BASED NOT ON REASON BUT ON PASSION , NOT ON PRINCIPLE BUT ON POLITICS . NOW LET ME BE CLEAR - I SUFFER NO ILLUSIONS ABOUT SADDAM HUSSEIN . HE IS A BRUTAL MAN . A UNKNOWNWORD MAN . A MAN WHO BUTCHERS HIS OWN PEOPLE TO SECURE HIS OWN POWER . HE HAS REPEATEDLY DEFIED UN UNKNOWNWORD , THWARTED UN INSPECTION TEAMS , DEVELOPED UNKNOWNWORD AND BIOLOGICAL WEAPONS , AND COVETED NUCLEAR CAPACITY . HE'S A BAD GUY . THE WORLD , AND THE IRAQI PEOPLE , WOULD BE BETTER OFF WITHOUT HIM . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT SADDAM POSES NO IMMINENT AND DIRECT THREAT TO THE UNITED STATES , OR TO HIS NEIGHBORS , THAT THE IRAQI ECONOMY IS IN SHAMBLES , THAT THE IRAQI MILITARY A FRACTION OF ITS FORMER STRENGTH , AND THAT IN CONCERT WITH THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY HE CAN BE CONTAINED UNTIL , IN THE WAY OF ALL PETTY DICTATORS , HE FALLS AWAY INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HISTORY . I KNOW THAT EVEN A SUCCESSFUL WAR AGAINST IRAQ WILL REQUIRE A US OCCUPATION OF UNDETERMINED LENGTH , AT UNDETERMINED COST , WITH UNDETERMINED CONSEQUENCES . I KNOW THAT AN INVASION OF IRAQ WITHOUT A CLEAR RATIONALE AND WITHOUT STRONG INTERNATIONAL SUPPORT WILL ONLY UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE MIDDLE EAST , AND ENCOURAGE THE WORST , RATHER THAN BEST , IMPULSES OF THE ARAB WORLD , AND STRENGTHEN THE RECRUITMENT ARM OF AL QAEDA . I AM NOT OPPOSED TO ALL WARS . I'M OPPOSED TO DUMB WARS . SO FOR THOSE OF US WHO SEEK A MORE JUST AND SECURE WORLD FOR OUR CHILDREN , LET US SEND A CLEAR MESSAGE TO THE PRESIDENT TODAY . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FINISH THE FIGHT WITH BIN LADEN AND AL QAEDA , THROUGH EFFECTIVE , COORDINATED INTELLIGENCE , AND A SHUTTING DOWN OF THE FINANCIAL NETWORKS THAT SUPPORT TERRORISM , AND A HOMELAND SECURITY PROGRAM THAT INVOLVES MORE THAN COLOR-CODED WARNINGS . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THE UN INSPECTORS CAN DO THEIR WORK , AND THAT WE VIGOROUSLY ENFORCE A NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY , AND THAT FORMER ENEMIES AND CURRENT ALLIES LIKE RUSSIA UNKNOWNWORD AND ULTIMATELY ELIMINATE THEIR STORES OF NUCLEAR MATERIAL , AND THAT NATIONS LIKE PAKISTAN AND INDIA NEVER USE THE TERRIBLE WEAPONS ALREADY IN THEIR POSSESSION , AND THAT THE ARMS MERCHANTS IN OUR OWN COUNTRY STOP FEEDING THE UNKNOWNWORD WARS THAT RAGE ACROSS THE GLOBE . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO MAKE SURE OUR SO-CALLED ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST , THE SAUDIS AND THE EGYPTIANS , STOP UNKNOWNWORD THEIR OWN PEOPLE , AND SUPPRESSING UNKNOWNWORD , AND TOLERATING CORRUPTION AND INEQUALITY , AND UNKNOWNWORD THEIR ECONOMIES SO THAT THEIR YOUTH GROW UP WITHOUT EDUCATION , WITHOUT PROSPECTS , WITHOUT HOPE , THE READY RECRUITS OF TERRORIST CELLS . YOU WANT A FIGHT , PRESIDENT BUSH ? LET'S FIGHT TO WEAN OURSELVES OFF MIDDLE EAST OIL , THROUGH AN ENERGY POLICY THAT DOESN'T SIMPLY SERVE THE INTERESTS OF EXXON AND UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE ARE THE BATTLES THAT WE NEED TO FIGHT . THOSE ARE THE BATTLES THAT WE WILLINGLY JOIN . THE BATTLES AGAINST IGNORANCE AND INTOLERANCE . CORRUPTION AND GREED . POVERTY AND DESPAIR . THE CONSEQUENCES OF WAR ARE DIRE , THE SACRIFICES UNKNOWNWORD . WE MAY HAVE OCCASION IN OUR LIFETIME TO ONCE AGAIN RISE UP IN DEFENSE OF OUR FREEDOM , AND PAY THE WAGES OF WAR . BUT WE OUGHT NOT -- WE WILL NOT -- TRAVEL DOWN THAT HELLISH PATH BLINDLY . NOR SHOULD WE ALLOW THOSE WHO WOULD MARCH OFF AND PAY THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE , WHO WOULD PROVE THE FULL MEASURE OF DEVOTION WITH THEIR BLOOD , TO MAKE SUCH AN AWFUL SACRIFICE IN VAIN .
BLUE	I'VE VISITED MANY SCHOOLS AND SPOKEN TO MANY TEACHERS AND STUDENTS THROUGHOUT MY TWO DECADES OF PUBLIC SERVICE , BUT ONE I'LL ALWAYS REMEMBER IS MY VISIT TO DODGE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL IN CHICAGO JUST A FEW YEARS AGO . I WAS TALKING WITH A YOUNG TEACHER THERE , AND I ASKED HER WHAT SHE SAW AS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE FACING HER STUDENTS . SHE GAVE ME AN ANSWER THAT I HAD NEVER HEARD BEFORE . SHE SPOKE ABOUT WHAT SHE CALLED "THESE KIDS SYNDROME " - THE TENDENCY TO EXPLAIN AWAY THE SHORTCOMINGS AND FAILURES OF OUR EDUCATION SYSTEM BY SAYING THAT "THESE KIDS CAN'T LEARN " OR "THESE KIDS DON'T WANT TO LEARN " OR "THESE KIDS ARE JUST TOO FAR BEHIND ." AND AFTER AWHILE , "THESE KIDS " BECOME SOMEBODY ELSE'S PROBLEM . AND THIS TEACHER LOOKED AT ME AND SAID , "WHEN I HEAR THAT TERM IT DRIVES ME NUTS . THEY'RE NOT .THESE KIDS .' THEY'RE OUR KIDS . ALL OF THEM ." SHE'S ABSOLUTELY RIGHT . THE SMALL CHILD IN MANCHESTER OR NASHUA WHOSE PARENTS CAN'T FIND OR AFFORD A QUALITY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE KNOW WOULD MAKE HIM MORE LIKELY TO STAY IN SCHOOL , AND READ BETTER , AND SUCCEED LATER IN LIFE - HE IS OUR CHILD . THE LITTLE GIRL IN RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA OR THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO WHOSE SCHOOL IS LITERALLY FALLING DOWN AROUND HER , AND CAN'T AFFORD NEW TEXTBOOKS , AND CAN'T ATTRACT NEW TEACHERS BECAUSE IT CAN'T AFFORD TO PAY THEM A DECENT SALARY - SHE IS OUR CHILD . THE TEENAGER IN SUBURBAN BOSTON WHO NEEDS MORE SKILLS AND BETTER SCHOOLING TO COMPETE FOR THE SAME JOBS AS THE TEENAGER IN BANGALORE OR BEIJING - HE IS OUR CHILD . THESE CHILDREN ARE OUR CHILDREN . THEIR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND IT'S TIME WE UNDERSTOOD THAT THEIR EDUCATION IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY . ALL OF US . THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT FOR OUR GENERATION . REVOLUTIONS IN COMMUNICATIONS AND TECHNOLOGY HAVE CREATED A GLOBAL ECONOMY OF HIGH-TECH , HIGH-WAGE JOBS THAT CAN BE LOCATED ANYWHERE THERE'S AN INTERNET CONNECTION - AN ECONOMY WHERE THE MOST VALUABLE SKILL YOU CAN SELL IS YOUR KNOWLEDGE . EDUCATION IS NOW THE CURRENCY OF THE INFORMATION AGE . IT'S NO LONGER JUST A PATHWAY TO OPPORTUNITY AND SUCCESS - IT'S A PRE-REQUISITE . THERE SIMPLY AREN'T AS MANY JOBS TODAY THAT CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY WHERE ONLY A HIGH SCHOOL DEGREE IS REQUIRED . AND IF YOU DON'T HAVE THAT DEGREE , THERE ARE EVEN FEWER JOBS AVAILABLE THAT CAN KEEP YOU OUT OF POVERTY . IN THIS KIND OF ECONOMY , COUNTRIES WHO OUT-EDUCATE US TODAY WILL OUT-COMPETE US TOMORROW . ALREADY , CHINA IS UNKNOWNWORD EIGHT TIMES AS MANY ENGINEERS AS WE ARE . BY UNKNOWNWORD GRADE , OUR CHILDREN SCORE LOWER ON MATH AND SCIENCE TESTS THAN MOST OTHER KIDS IN THE WORLD . AND WE NOW HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATES OF ANY INDUSTRIALIZED NATION IN THE WORLD . WELL I DO NOT ACCEPT THIS FUTURE FOR AMERICA . I DO NOT ACCEPT AN AMERICA WHERE WE DO NOTHING ABOUT SIX MILLION STUDENTS WHO ARE READING BELOW THEIR GRADE LEVEL - AN AMERICA WHERE SIXTY PERCENT OF AFRICAN-AMERICAN FOURTH GRADERS AREN'T EVEN READING AT THE BASIC LEVEL . I DO NOT ACCEPT AN AMERICA WHERE ONLY TWENTY PERCENT OF OUR STUDENTS ARE PREPARED TO TAKE COLLEGE-LEVEL UNKNOWNWORD IN ENGLISH , MATH , AND SCIENCE - WHERE BARELY ONE IN TEN LOW-INCOME STUDENTS WILL EVER GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE . I DO NOT ACCEPT AN AMERICA WHERE WE DO NOTHING ABOUT THE FACT THAT HALF OF ALL TEENAGERS ARE UNABLE TO UNDERSTAND BASIC UNKNOWNWORD - WHERE NEARLY NINE IN TEN AFRICAN-AMERICAN AND LATINO EIGHTH GRADERS ARE NOT PROFICIENT IN MATH . I DO NOT ACCEPT AN AMERICA WHERE ELEMENTARY SCHOOL KIDS ARE ONLY GETTING AN AVERAGE OF TWENTY-FIVE MINUTES OF SCIENCE EACH DAY WHEN WE KNOW THAT OVER 80 % OF THE UNKNOWNWORD JOBS REQUIRE A KNOWLEDGE BASE IN MATH AND SCIENCE . THIS KIND OF AMERICA IS MORALLY UNACCEPTABLE FOR OUR CHILDREN . IT'S ECONOMICALLY UNTENABLE FOR OUR FUTURE . AND IT'S NOT WHO WE ARE AS A COUNTRY . WE ARE NOT A .THESE KIDS ' NATION . WE ARE THE NATION THAT HAS ALWAYS UNDERSTOOD THAT OUR FUTURE IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO THE EDUCATION OF OUR CHILDREN - ALL OF THEM . WE ARE THE COUNTRY THAT HAS ALWAYS BELIEVED IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DECLARATION THAT "...TALENT AND VIRTUE , NEEDED IN A FREE SOCIETY , SHOULD BE EDUCATED REGARDLESS OF WEALTH OR BIRTH ." IT'S THIS BELIEF THAT LED AMERICA TO SET UP THE FIRST FREE PUBLIC SCHOOLS IN SMALL NEW ENGLAND TOWNS . IT'S A PROMISE WE KEPT AS WE MOVED FROM A NATION OF FARMS TO FACTORIES AND CREATED A SYSTEM OF PUBLIC HIGH SCHOOLS SO THAT EVERYONE HAD THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED IN A NEW ECONOMY . IT'S A PROMISE WE EXPANDED AFTER WORLD WAR II , WHEN AMERICA GAVE MY GRANDFATHER AND OVER TWO MILLION RETURNING HEROES THE CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE ON THE GI BILL . AND WHEN AMERICA HAS FALLEN SHORT OF THIS PROMISE - WHEN WE FORCED LINDA BROWN TO WALK MILES TO A UNKNOWNWORD TOPEKA SCHOOL BECAUSE OF THE COLOR OF HER SKIN ; IT WAS ORDINARY AMERICANS WHO MARCHED AND BLED ; WHO TOOK TO THE STREETS AND FOUGHT IN THE COURTS UNTIL THE UNKNOWNWORD OF NINE LITTLE CHILDREN AT A LITTLE ROCK SCHOOL MADE REAL THE DECISION THAT IN AMERICA , SEPARATE CAN NEVER BE EQUAL . THAT'S WHO WE ARE . THAT'S WHY I CAN STAND HERE TODAY . BECAUSE SOMEBODY STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS HARD ; STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS RISKY . BECAUSE EVEN THOUGH MY MOTHER DIDN'T HAVE A LOT OF MONEY , SCHOLARSHIPS GAVE ME THE CHANCE TO GO TO SOME OF THE BEST SCHOOLS IN THE COUNTRY . AND I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE I WANT TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN CHILD THE SAME CHANCES THAT I HAD . IN THIS ELECTION - AT THIS DEFINING MOMENT - WE CAN DECIDE THAT THIS CENTURY WILL BE ANOTHER AMERICAN CENTURY BY MAKING AN HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION . WE CAN MAKE A COMMITMENT THAT'S MORE THAN JUST THE RHETORIC OF A CAMPAIGN - ONE THAT'S MORE THAN ANOTHER EMPTY PROMISE MADE BY A POLITICIAN LOOKING FOR YOUR VOTE . I OFTEN SAY THAT THE PROBLEM WITH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND IS THAT GEORGE BUSH LEFT THE MONEY BEHIND . AND IT WASN'T JUST HIM , EITHER . IT'S PRETTY POPULAR TO BASH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND OUT ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL , BUT WHEN IT WAS BEING DEBATED IN CONGRESS FOUR YEARS AGO , MY COLLEAGUE DICK DURBIN OFFERED EVERYONE A CHANCE TO VOTE SO THAT THE LAW COULDN'T BE ENFORCED UNLESS IT WAS FULLY FUNDED . SENATOR EDWARDS AND SENATOR CLINTON PASSED ON THAT CHANCE , AND I BELIEVE THAT WAS A SERIOUS MISTAKE . BECAUSE I THINK WE'D ALL AGREE THAT THE GOALS OF THIS LAW WERE THE RIGHT ONES . MAKING A PROMISE TO EDUCATE EVERY CHILD WITH AN EXCELLENT TEACHER IS RIGHT . CLOSING THE ACHIEVEMENT GAP THAT EXISTS IN TOO MANY CITIES AND RURAL AREAS IS RIGHT . MAKING SURE THAT NECESSARY RESOURCES AND QUALIFIED TEACHERS ARE DISTRIBUTED EQUITABLY AMONG EVERY CITY AND SMALL TOWN IS RIGHT . MORE ACCOUNTABILITY IS RIGHT . HIGHER STANDARDS ARE RIGHT . BUT I'LL TELL YOU WHAT'S WRONG WITH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND . UNKNOWNWORD OUR TEACHERS , OUR PRINCIPALS , AND OUR SCHOOLS TO ACCOMPLISH ALL OF THIS WITHOUT THE RESOURCES THEY NEED IS WRONG . PROMISING HIGH-QUALITY TEACHERS IN EVERY CLASSROOM AND THEN LEAVING THE SUPPORT AND THE PAY FOR THOSE TEACHERS BEHIND IS WRONG . LABELING A SCHOOL AND ITS STUDENTS AS FAILURES ONE DAY AND THEN THROWING YOUR HANDS UP AND WALKING AWAY FROM THEM THE NEXT IS WRONG . AND BY THE WAY - DON'T TELL US THAT THE ONLY WAY TO TEACH A CHILD IS TO SPEND MOST OF THE YEAR PREPARING HIM TO FILL IN A FEW UNKNOWNWORD ON A STANDARDIZED TEST . DON'T TELL US THAT THESE TESTS HAVE TO COME AT THE EXPENSE OF MUSIC , OR ART , OR PHYS . ED ., OR SCIENCE . THESE TESTS SHOULDN'T COME AT THE EXPENSE OF A WELL-ROUNDED EDUCATION - THEY SHOULD HELP COMPLETE THAT WELL-ROUNDED EDUCATION . THE TEACHERS I'VE MET DIDN'T DEVOTE THEIR LIVES TO TESTING , THEY DEVOTED THEM TO TEACHING , AND TEACHING OUR CHILDREN IS WHAT THEY SHOULD BE ALLOWED TO DO . THE FACT IS , NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND HAS DONE MORE TO STIGMATIZE AND DEMORALIZE OUR STUDENTS AND TEACHERS IN STRUGGLING SCHOOLS THAN IT HAS TO MARSHAL THE TALENT AND THE DETERMINATION AND THE RESOURCES TO TURN THEM AROUND . THAT'S WHAT'S WRONG WITH NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND , AND THAT'S WHAT WE MUST CHANGE IN A FUNDAMENTAL WAY . I WANT TO LEAD A NEW ERA OF MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN EDUCATION - ONE WHERE WE ALL COME TOGETHER FOR THE SAKE OF OUR CHILDREN'S SUCCESS ; AN ERA WHERE EACH OF US DOES OUR PART TO MAKE THAT SUCCESS A REALITY - PARENTS AND TEACHERS ; LEADERS IN WASHINGTON AND CITIZENS ALL ACROSS AMERICA . I WON'T PRETEND THAT THIS WILL BE EASY . WE MUST FIX THE FAILURES OF NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND . WE MUST PROVIDE THE FUNDING WE WERE PROMISED , AND GIVE OUR STATES THE RESOURCES THEY NEED , AND FINALLY MEET OUR COMMITMENT TO SPECIAL EDUCATION . BUT THAT ALONE IS NOT AN EDUCATION POLICY . IT'S JUST A STARTING POINT . A TRULY HISTORIC COMMITMENT TO EDUCATION - A REAL COMMITMENT - WILL REQUIRE NEW RESOURCES AND NEW REFORMS . IT WILL REQUIRE A WILLINGNESS TO BREAK FREE FROM THE SAME DEBATES THAT WASHINGTON HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN FOR DECADES - DEMOCRAT VERSUS REPUBLICAN ; VOUCHERS VERSUS THE STATUS QUO ; MORE MONEY VERSUS MORE ACCOUNTABILITY . AND MOST OF ALL , IT WILL TAKE A PRESIDENT WHO IS HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE - WHO DOESN'T JUST TELL EVERYONE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR , BUT WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR . I AM RUNNING TO BE THAT PRESIDENT . AND THAT'S WHY I'M PROPOSING A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO GIVE EVERY AMERICAN CHILD THE CHANCE TO RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION AMERICA HAS TO OFFER - FROM THE MOMENT THEY'RE BORN TO THE DAY THEY GRADUATE COLLEGE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL PUT THE FULL RESOURCES OF THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT BEHIND THIS PLAN . BUT TO MAKE IT A REALITY , I WILL ALSO ASK MORE OF TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS ; PARENTS AND STUDENTS ; SCHOOLS AND COMMUNITIES . A FEW WEEKS AGO , I INTRODUCED MY PLAN TO MAKE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE BY CREATING A $4,000 PER YEAR REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT THAT WILL COVER TWO-THIRDS OF THE TUITION AT THE AVERAGE PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY . AND YESTERDAY , I UNVEILED MY PROPOSAL TO STRENGTHEN OUR COMMUNITY COLLEGES BY OFFERING NEW DEGREES FOR EMERGING FIELDS AND REWARDING SCHOOLS THAT GRADUATE MORE STUDENTS . TODAY , I WANT TO TALK ABOUT WHAT WE CAN DO TO PREPARE EVERY STUDENT TO SUCCEED IN COLLEGE - PREPARATION THAT BEGINS AT BIRTH AND CONTINUES WITH WORLD-CLASS SCHOOLS , OUTSTANDING TEACHERS , AND TRANSFORMATIVE PRINCIPALS . THE FIRST PART OF MY PLAN UNKNOWNWORD ON PROVIDING QUALITY , AFFORDABLE EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION TO EVERY AMERICAN CHILD . WE KNOW WHAT A DIFFERENCE EARLY CHILDHOOD PROGRAMS MAKE IN THE LIVES OF OUR KIDS . STUDY AFTER STUDY PROVES THAT CHILDREN IN THESE PROGRAMS - ESPECIALLY LOW-INCOME CHILDREN - ARE MORE LIKELY TO SCORE HIGHER IN READING AND MATH , MORE LIKELY TO GRADUATE HIGH SCHOOL AND ATTEND COLLEGE , MORE LIKELY TO HOLD A JOB AND MORE LIKELY TO EARN MORE ON THAT JOB . AND FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD WE INVEST IN THESE PROGRAMS , WE GET $10 BACK IN REDUCED WELFARE UNKNOWNWORD , FEWER HEALTH CARE COSTS , AND LESS CRIME . IN RECENT YEARS , STATES HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ENROLL NEARLY ONE MILLION FOUR YEAR OLDS IN PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS . THAT'S A GREAT SUCCESS , BUT I BELIEVE WE CAN DO BETTER . WE NEED TO ENROLL MORE CHILDREN AND WE NEED TO START AT AN EVEN EARLIER AGE . BECAUSE THE FACT IS , STUDIES SHOW THAT FROM THE TIME OF CONCEPTION TO THE FIRST DAY OF KINDERGARTEN , CHILDREN'S DEVELOPMENT PROGRESSES FASTER THAN AT ANY OTHER STAGE OF LIFE . BY THE AGE OF THREE , 85 % OF THE BRAIN'S CORE STRUCTURE IS ALREADY FORMED . EIGHTY-FIVE PERCENT . SO HERE'S WHAT WE DID IN ILLINOIS . AS A STATE SENATOR , I HELPED CREATE THE ILLINOIS EARLY LEARNING COUNCIL , WHICH LAUNCHED A PROGRAM CALLED PRESCHOOL FOR ALL . THIS HAS MADE US ONE OF THE FIRST STATES TO COMMIT TO A HIGH QUALITY EARLY LEARNING PROGRAM THAT STARTS HELPING CHILDREN FROM THE DAY THEY'RE BORN . IT PROVIDES EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR NEW FAMILIES AS WELL AS AT-RISK INFANTS AND TODDLERS , AND OFFER AT-RISK UNKNOWNWORD OLDS AND ALL FOUR-YEAR-OLDS THE CHANCE TO ENROLL IN PRE-KINDERGARTEN PROGRAMS . THERE IS NO REASON WE CAN'T AND SHOULDN'T REPLICATE THIS ALL ACROSS AMERICA . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LAUNCH A CHILDREN'S FIRST AGENDA THAT PROVIDES CARE , LEARNING AND SUPPORT TO FAMILIES WITH CHILDREN AGES ZERO TO FIVE . WE'LL CREATE EARLY LEARNING GRANTS TO HELP STATES CREATE A SYSTEM OF HIGH-QUALITY EARLY CARE AND EDUCATION FOR ALL YOUNG CHILDREN AND THEIR FAMILIES . WE'LL INCREASE HEAD START FUNDING AND QUADRUPLE EARLY START TO INCLUDE A QUARTER OF A MILLION AT-RISK CHILDREN . I WILL CREATE A PRESIDENTIAL EARLY LEARNING COUNCIL TO COORDINATE THIS EFFORT ACROSS ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND ENSURE THAT WE'RE PROVIDING THESE CHILDREN AND FAMILIES WITH THE HIGHEST QUALITY PROGRAMS . AND WE'LL HELP MORE WORKING PARENTS FIND A SAFE , AFFORDABLE PLACE TO LEAVE THEIR CHILDREN DURING THE DAY BY IMPROVING THE EDUCATIONAL QUALITY OF OUR CHILD CARE PROGRAMS AND INCREASING THE CHILD CARE TAX CREDIT . THAT'S HOW WE'LL GIVE OUR KIDS THE BEST POSSIBLE START IN LIFE , AND THAT'S THE COMMITMENT AMERICA WILL MAKE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . THE SECOND PART OF MY EDUCATION PLAN IS TO RECRUIT , SUPPORT , AND REWARD TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS TO ENSURE THAT EVERY SCHOOL IN AMERICA IS FILLED WITH OUTSTANDING EDUCATORS . WE KNOW THAT FROM THE MOMENT OUR CHILDREN STEP INTO A CLASSROOM , THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN DETERMINING THEIR ACHIEVEMENT IS NOT THE COLOR OF THEIR SKIN OR WHERE THEY COME FROM ; IT'S NOT WHO THEIR PARENTS ARE OR HOW MUCH MONEY THEY HAVE . IT'S WHO THEIR TEACHER IS . IT'S THE MAN OR WOMAN WHO UNKNOWNWORD PAST THE LAST BELL AND SPENDS THEIR OWN MONEY ON BOOKS AND SUPPLIES . IT'S PEOPLE LIKE MY SISTER WHO GO BEYOND THE CALL OF DUTY BECAUSE SHE BELIEVES THAT'S WHAT MAKES THE EXTRA DIFFERENCE . AND IT DOES . WELL IF WE KNOW HOW MUCH TEACHING MATTERS , IT'S TIME AMERICA STARTED ACTING LIKE IT . IT'S TIME WE TREATED TEACHING LIKE THE PROFESSION IT IS . I DON'T WANT TO JUST TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT TEACHERS ARE - I WANT TO BE A PRESIDENT WHO REWARDS THEM FOR THEIR GREATNESS . THAT STARTS WITH RECRUITING A NEW GENERATION OF TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS TO REPLACE THE GENERATION THAT'S RETIRING AND TO KEEP UP WITH THE RECORD NUMBER OF STUDENTS ENTERING OUR SCHOOLS . WE'LL CREATE A NEW SERVICE SCHOLARSHIP PROGRAM TO RECRUIT TOP TALENT INTO THE PROFESSION , AND BEGIN BY PLACING THESE NEW TEACHERS IN AREAS LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD DISTRICTS OF NEVADA , OR STRUGGLING RURAL TOWNS HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , OR HARD-TO-STAFF UNKNOWNWORD LIKE MATH AND SCIENCE IN SCHOOLS ALL ACROSS THE NATION . AND I WILL MAKE THIS PLEDGE AS PRESIDENT - IF YOU COMMIT YOUR LIFE TO TEACHING , AMERICA WILL COMMIT TO PAYING FOR YOUR COLLEGE EDUCATION . TO PREPARE OUR NEW TEACHERS , WE'LL REQUIRE THAT ALL SCHOOLS OF EDUCATION ARE ACCREDITED , AND WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD THEIR OUTCOMES SO THAT WE KNOW WHICH ONES ARE DOING THE BEST JOB AT PREPARING THE BEST TEACHERS . WE'LL ALSO CREATE A VOLUNTARY NATIONAL PERFORMANCE ASSESSMENT THAT ACTUALLY LOOKS AT HOW PROSPECTIVE TEACHERS CAN PLAN , TEACH , AND SUPPORT STUDENT LEARNING , SO WE CAN BE SURE THAT EVERY NEW EDUCATOR IS TRAINED AND READY TO WALK INTO THE CLASSROOM AND START TEACHING EFFECTIVELY . NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ALREADY LEADING THE WAY HERE BY HAVING DESIGNED A PERFORMANCE-BASED EDUCATOR PREPARATION SYSTEM , AND THE NATIONAL ASSESSMENT I'M PROPOSING WOULD HELP STATES LIKE THIS ONE ACHIEVE THEIR GOALS FOR STATE-OF-THE-ART PREPARATION OF ALL TEACHERS . TO SUPPORT OUR TEACHERS , WE WILL EXPAND MENTORING PROGRAMS THAT PAIR EXPERIENCED , SUCCESSFUL TEACHERS WITH NEW RECRUITS . WE KNOW THAT MENTORING IS ONE OF THE MOST EFFECTIVE WAYS TO RETAIN THE ONE-THIRD OF NEW TEACHERS WHO LEAVE THE PROFESSION IN THE FIRST FIVE YEARS . IN STATES THAT HAVE TRIED THIS , LIKE CALIFORNIA , ONLY FIVE PERCENT OF NEW TEACHERS HAVE QUIT . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL EXPAND THESE MENTORING PROGRAMS NATIONWIDE TO GIVE ALL OUR TEACHERS THE CHANCE TO SUCCEED . AND I WILL ALSO MAKE SURE THAT TEACHERS HAVE THE CONDITIONS IN WHICH THEY CAN SUCCEED - INCLUDING EXCELLENT PRINCIPALS WHO SUPPORT THEIR WORK , THE MATERIALS THEY NEED TO TEACH EFFECTIVELY , AND TIME TO PLAN AND COLLABORATE WITH ONE ANOTHER ON IMPROVING INSTRUCTION . AND WHERE THEY DO SUCCEED - WHERE OUR TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS GO ABOVE AND BEYOND THE CALL TO MAKE A REAL DIFFERENCE IN OUR CHILDREN'S LIVES - I THINK IT'S TIME WE REWARDED THEM FOR IT . CITIES LIKE DENVER HAVE ALREADY PROVEN THAT BY WORKING WITH TEACHERS , THIS CAN WORK - THAT WE CAN FIND NEW WAYS TO INCREASE PAY THAT ARE DEVELOPED WITH TEACHERS , NOT IMPOSED ON THEM AND NOT JUST BASED ON AN ARBITRARY TEST SCORE . MY PLAN WOULD PROVIDE RESOURCES TO TRY THESE INNOVATIVE PROGRAMS IN SCHOOL DISTRICTS ALL ACROSS AMERICA . UNDER MY CAREER LADDER INITIATIVE , THESE DISTRICTS WILL BE ABLE TO DESIGN PROGRAMS THAT REWARD ACCOMPLISHED EDUCATORS WHO SERVE AS UNKNOWNWORD TO NEW TEACHERS WITH THE SALARY INCREASE THEY DESERVE . THEY CAN REWARD THOSE WHO TEACH IN UNDERSERVED PLACES LIKE RURAL NEW HAMPSHIRE AND ACROSS URBAN AMERICA . AND IF TEACHERS ACQUIRE ADDITIONAL KNOWLEDGE AND SKILLS TO SERVE STUDENTS BETTER - IF THEY CONSISTENTLY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CLASSROOM - THAT WORK CAN BE VALUED AND REWARDED AS WELL . NOW , IF WE DO ALL THIS AND FIND THAT THERE ARE TEACHERS WHO ARE STILL STRUGGLING AND UNDERPERFORMING , WE SHOULD PROVIDE THEM WITH INDIVIDUAL HELP AND SUPPORT . AND IF THEY'RE STILL UNDERPERFORMING AFTER THAT , WE SHOULD FIND A QUICK AND FAIR WAY TO PUT ANOTHER TEACHER IN THAT CLASSROOM . TEACHER ASSOCIATIONS AND SCHOOL BOARDS IN A NUMBER OF CITIES HAVE LED THE WAY BY DEVELOPING PEER ASSISTANCE AND REVIEW PLANS THAT DO EXACTLY THIS - SETTING PROFESSIONAL STANDARDS THAT PUT CHILDREN FIRST . WE OWE OUR TEACHERS THAT , AND WE OWE OUR CHILDREN THAT . AND WHILE WE'RE AT IT , LET'S FINALLY HELP OUR TEACHERS AND PRINCIPALS DEVELOP ASSESSMENTS THAT TEACH OUR KIDS TO BECOME MORE THAN JUST GOOD UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY THE THIRD PART OF MY PLAN IS TO WORK WITH OUR NATION'S GOVERNORS AND EDUCATORS TO CREATE AND USE ASSESSMENTS THAT CAN IMPROVE ACHIEVEMENT ALL ACROSS AMERICA BY INCLUDING THE KINDS OF RESEARCH , UNKNOWNWORD INVESTIGATION , AND PROBLEM-SOLVING THAT OUR CHILDREN WILL NEED TO COMPETE IN A 21ST CENTURY KNOWLEDGE ECONOMY . NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS BEEN A LEADER ON THIS . YOU'VE DEVELOPED INNOVATIVE ASSESSMENTS , INCLUDING DIGITAL PORTFOLIOS , TO DEVELOP AND DEMONSTRATE STUDENT PROFICIENCY IN TECHNOLOGY , SCIENCE , AND OTHER CORE CONTENT AREAS , AND THERE'S NO REASON WE CAN'T START REPLICATING THIS ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY . THE GOAL OF EDUCATIONAL TESTING SHOULD BE THE SAME AS MEDICAL TESTING - TO DIAGNOSE A STUDENT'S NEEDS SO YOU CAN HELP ADDRESS THEM . TESTS SHOULD NOT BE DESIGNED AS PUNISHMENT FOR TEACHERS AND STUDENTS , THEY SHOULD BE USED AS TOOLS TO HELP OUR CHILDREN GROW AND COMPETE . TESTS SHOULD SUPPORT LEARNING , NOT JUST ACCOUNTING . BECAUSE IF WE REALLY WANT OUR CHILDREN TO BECOME THE GREAT INVENTORS AND PROBLEM-SOLVERS OF TOMORROW , OUR SCHOOLS SHOULDN'T STIFLE INNOVATION , THEY SHOULD LET IT THRIVE . ONE OF THE SUBJECT AREAS WHERE THIS IS ESPECIALLY IMPORTANT IS SCIENCE . NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND'S INTENSE UNKNOWNWORD ON TEACHING TO THE TEST HAS BEEN SHOWN TO REDUCE THE AMOUNT OF TIME SPENT ON TEACHING AND ASSESSING SCIENCE - A SUBJECT AREA THAT IS ABSOLUTELY CRITICAL TO OUR COMPETITIVENESS AS A NATION . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE WILL MAKE SCIENCE INSTRUCTION A NATIONAL PRIORITY , AND WE'LL DEVELOP ASSESSMENTS THAT DON'T JUST TEST UNKNOWNWORD BITS OF INFORMATION , BUT ADVANCED SKILLS LIKE LOGIC , DATA ANALYSIS , AND UNKNOWNWORD . NEW HAMPSHIRE HAS ALREADY BEGUN TO DO THIS , AND THERE'S NO REASON THE REST OF THE COUNTRY CAN'T DO THE SAME THING . FINALLY , AS YOU AND I STAND HERE TODAY , KNOW THAT THERE IS A GENERATION OF CHILDREN GROWING UP ON THE MEAN STREETS AND FORGOTTEN CORNERS OF THIS COUNTRY WHO ARE SLIPPING AWAY FROM US AS WE SPEAK . THEY WALK DOWN CORRIDORS OF SHAME IN RURAL SOUTH CAROLINA AND SIT IN BATTERED CLASSROOMS SOMEWHERE IN EAST L.A . THEY ARE OVERWHELMINGLY BLACK AND LATINO AND POOR . AND WHEN THEY LOOK AROUND AND SEE THAT NO ONE HAS LIFTED A FINGER TO FIX THEIR SCHOOL SINCE THE 19TH CENTURY ; WHEN THEY ARE PUSHED OUT THE DOOR AT THE SOUND OF THE LAST BELL - SOME INTO A VIRTUAL WAR ZONE - IS IT ANY WONDER THEY DON'T THINK THEIR EDUCATION IS IMPORTANT ? IS IT ANY WONDER THAT THEY ARE DROPPING OUT IN RATES WE'VE NEVER SEEN BEFORE ? I KNOW THESE CHILDREN . I KNOW THEIR SENSE OF HOPELESSNESS . I BEGAN MY CAREER OVER TWO DECADES AGO AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ON THE STREETS OF UNKNOWNWORD SOUTH SIDE . AND I WORKED WITH PARENTS AND TEACHERS AND LOCAL LEADERS TO FIGHT FOR THEIR FUTURE . WE SET UP AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND WE EVEN PROTESTED OUTSIDE GOVERNMENT OFFICES SO THAT WE COULD GET THOSE WHO HAD DROPPED OUT INTO ALTERNATIVE SCHOOLS . AND IN TIME , WE CHANGED FUTURES . AND SO WHILE I KNOW HOPELESSNESS , I ALSO KNOW HOPE . I KNOW THAT IF WE BRING EARLY EDUCATION PROGRAMS TO THESE COMMUNITIES ; IF WE STOP WAITING UNTIL HIGH-SCHOOL TO ADDRESS THE DROP-OUT RATE AND START IN EARLIER GRADES ; IF WE BRING IN NEW , QUALIFIED TEACHERS ; IF WE EXPAND COLLEGE OUTREACH PROGRAMS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UP AND UNKNOWNWORD AND FIGHT TO EXPAND SUMMER LEARNING OPPORTUNITIES LIKE I'VE DONE IN THE SENATE ; IF WE DO ALL THIS , WE CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF OUR CHILDREN AND THE LIFE OF THIS COUNTRY - NOT JUST IN EAST L.A . OR THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO , BUT HERE IN MANCHESTER , AND SUBURBAN BOSTON , AND RURAL MISSISSIPPI . I KNOW WE CAN . I'VE SEEN IT HAPPEN . AND I WILL WORK EVERY DAY TO DO IT AGAIN AS YOUR PRESIDENT . BUT I CANNOT DO IT ALONE . GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO IT ALONE . WE CAN SPEND BILLION AFTER BILLION ON EDUCATION IN THIS COUNTRY . WE CAN DEVELOP A PROGRAM FOR EVERY PROBLEM IMAGINABLE , AND WE CAN FUND THOSE PROGRAMS WITH EVERY LAST DIME WE HAVE . BUT THERE IS NO PROGRAM AND NO POLICY THAT CAN SUBSTITUTE FOR A PARENT WHO IS INVOLVED IN THEIR CHILD'S EDUCATION FROM DAY ONE . THERE IS NO SUBSTITUTE FOR A PARENT WHO WILL ATTEND THOSE PARENT/TEACHER CONFERENCES , MAKE SURE THEIR CHILDREN ARE IN SCHOOL ON TIME , AND HELP THEM WITH THEIR HOMEWORK AFTER DINNER . AND I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE WILL STILL BE TALKING ABOUT THESE PROBLEMS IN THE NEXT CENTURY IF WE DO NOT HAVE PARENTS WHO ARE WILLING TO TURN OFF THE TV ONCE IN AWHILE , AND PUT AWAY THE VIDEO GAMES , AND READ TO THEIR CHILD . RESPONSIBILITY FOR OUR CHILDREN'S EDUCATION HAS TO START AT HOME . WE HAVE TO SET HIGH STANDARDS FOR THEM , AND SPEND TIME WITH THEM , AND LOVE THEM . WE HAVE TO HOLD OURSELVES ACCOUNTABLE . YOU KNOW A FEW YEARS AGO , A LITTLE GIRL AT EARHART ELEMENTARY IN CHICAGO WAS ASKED THE SECRET TO HER ACADEMIC SUCCESS . SHE SAID , "I JUST STUDY HARD EVERY NIGHT BECAUSE I LIKE LEARNING . MY TEACHER WANTS ME TO BE A GOOD STUDENT , AND SO DOES MY MOTHER . I DON'T WANT TO LET THEM DOWN ." THE CHALLENGE WE FACE AT THIS MOMENT IS GREAT , BUT WE HAVE MET GREAT CHALLENGES BEFORE . OVER THE COURSE OF TWO CENTURIES , WE HAVE FOUGHT AND STRUGGLED AND OVERCOME TO EXPAND THE PROMISE OF A GOOD EDUCATION EVER FURTHER - A PROMISE THAT HAS ALLOWED MILLIONS TO TRANSCEND THE BARRIERS OF RACE AND CLASS AND BACKGROUND TO ACHIEVE THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . IT IS NOW OUR MOMENT TO KEEP THAT PROMISE - THE PROMISE OF AMERICA - ALIVE IN THE 21ST CENTURY . IT'S OUR GENERATION'S TURN TO STAND UP AND SAY TO THE LITTLE GIRL IN CHICAGO , OR THE LITTLE BOY IN MANCHESTER , OR THE MILLIONS LIKE THEM ALL ACROSS THE COUNTRY THAT THEY ARE NOT .THESE KIDS ' - THEY ARE OUR KIDS . THEY DO NOT WANT TO LET US DOWN , AND WE CANNOT LET THEM DOWN EITHER . THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE FIGHTING FOR IN THIS ELECTION , AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . I HOPE YOU'LL JOIN ME IN THAT JOURNEY . THANK YOU .
BLUE	WE MEET AT A DIFFICULT TIME FOR ORGANIZED LABOR . A WHILE BACK , I WENT TO A MAYTAG PLANT IN GALESBURG , ILLINOIS THAT WAS MOVING TO MEXICO . AND I MET WORKERS WHO WERE HAVING TO COMPETE WITH THEIR OWN CHILDREN FOR JOBS THAT PAY SEVEN BUCKS AN HOUR . A FEW MONTHS AGO , I TRAVELED TO NEWTON , WHERE MAYTAG WAS SHUTTING ITS DOORS AFTER 114 YEARS . ONE WORKER WHO'D BEEN THERE MORE THAN A DECADE SAID , "I JUST THOUGHT I WOULD RETIRE FROM HERE AND NEVER HAVE ANOTHER JOB . I'M SCARED ." I'M SCARED . IT MAKES US OUTRAGED TO HEAR THESE STORIES . AND WE'VE BEEN HEARING THEM FOR A LONG TIME . IT WAS STORIES LIKE THESE THAT LED ME MORE THAN TWO DECADES AGO TO WALK AWAY FROM A CAREER ON WALL STREET AND BECOME A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER IN CHICAGO , SO I COULD HELP FOLKS WHO'D LOST JOBS AND LOST HOPE WHEN THE NEARBY STEEL PLANTS CLOSED DOWN . I DIDN'T KNOW A SOUL IN CHICAGO , BUT I KNEW I DIDN'T LIKE THE IDEA OF WORKING PEOPLE BEING LAID OFF AND NOT HAVING ANYBODY FIGHTING FOR THEM . I KNEW I WANTED TO DO MY PART TO MAKE SURE THEY HAD A DECENT FUTURE . SO WHEN I GO TO PLACES LIKE GALESBURG OR NEWTON , IT REMINDS ME WHY I ENTERED PUBLIC SERVICE . AND IT REMINDS ME WHY I'M A DEMOCRAT . BECAUSE IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY MEANS ANYTHING , THEN IT HAS TO MEAN WE VALUE LABOR . IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY STANDS FOR ANYTHING , THEN IT HAS TO STAND UP FOR YOUR RIGHTS , AND YOUR FUTURE . IF THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS A VISION FOR AMERICA - THEN IT HAS TO BE AN AMERICA THAT'S WORKING FOR WORKING AMERICANS . BUT WE ALL KNOW THAT FOR A LONG TIME NOW , WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO DOESN'T SEE IT THAT WAY . WE HAVE LIVED THROUGH SIX YEARS OF THE MOST ANTI-LABOR ADMINISTRATION IN GENERATIONS . THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN UNIONS . THEY DON'T BELIEVE IN ORGANIZING . THEY'VE PACKED THE LABOR RELATIONS BOARD WITH THEIR CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD . WELL , WE'VE GOT NEWS FOR THEM - IT'S NOT THE DEPARTMENT OF MANAGEMENT , IT'S THE DEPARTMENT OF LABOR , AND WE'RE GOING TO TAKE IT BACK . BUT DESPITE SIX YEARS OF THEM DOING EVERYTHING THEY COULD TO TEAR LABOR DOWN - AS I LOOK OUT ON THIS CROWD AND AS I TRAVEL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY , THE ONE THING I KNOW FOR CERTAIN IS THAT THE UAW IS STILL FIGHTING . THE UAW IS STILL MOBILIZING . THE UAW IS STILL ORGANIZING . I'M TIRED OF PLAYING DEFENSE . I KNOW THE UAW IS TIRED OF PLAYING DEFENSE . WE'RE READY TO PLAY SOME OFFENSE . WE'RE READY TO PLAY OFFENSE FOR A SECURE RETIREMENT . WE'RE READY TO PLAY OFFENSE TO ENFORCE LABOR LAWS . WE'RE READY TO PLAY OFFENSE FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE . I'M TIRED OF SEEING UNIONS GO TO THE UNKNOWNWORD TABLE AND FIGHT FOR THE BENEFITS THEY NEGOTIATED A LONG TIME AGO , INSTEAD OF FIGHTING FOR BETTER WAGES TO SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES . I REFORMED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS . AND I DID IT BY REACHING OUT TO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS . WE TOOK ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY , AND WE WON . AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . I'VE GOT A PLAN THAT CUTS COSTS FOR THE TYPICAL FAMILY BY UP TO $2,500 A YEAR - MORE THAN ANY OTHER PLAN THAT'S BEEN OFFERED IN THIS RACE . AND I MAKE THIS SOLEMN PLEDGE TO YOU - I'LL SIGN MY UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE PLAN INTO LAW BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM . WE'RE READY TO PLAY OFFENSE FOR AMERICAN WORKERS . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'RE NOT GOING TO WAIT TWENTY YEARS OR TEN YEARS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE - WE'LL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE WITH INFLATION EVERY YEAR SO THAT AMERICAN WORKERS AREN'T FALLING BEHIND . AND WE'LL TAKE TAX BREAKS AWAY FROM COMPANIES THAT SHIP OUR JOBS OVERSEAS AND PUT THEM IN THE POCKETS OF WORKING AMERICANS WHO DESERVE IT . WE'RE NOT GOING TO STOP GLOBALIZATION IN ITS TRACKS , BUT WE SHOULDN'T BE STANDING IDLY BY WHILE AMERICAN JOBS ARE SHIPPED OVERSEAS . IT'S TIME TO PUT MAIN STREET AHEAD OF WALL STREET WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE . THE ONLY TRADE AGREEMENTS I BELIEVE IN ARE ONES THAT PUT WORKERS FIRST - BECAUSE TRADE DEALS AREN'T GOOD FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IF THEY AREN'T GOOD FOR WORKING PEOPLE . THAT'S WHY I OPPOSED CAFTA . THAT'S WHY I OPPOSE THE SOUTH KOREA FREE TRADE AGREEMENT . THAT'S WHY I VOTED TO BLOCK MEXICAN TRUCKS FROM ENTERING THIS COUNTRY . AND THAT'S WHY WE NEED TO AMEND NAFTA . WE'RE READY TO TAKE THE OFFENSE FOR ORGANIZED LABOR . IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T CHOKE SAYING THE WORD "UNION ." WE NEED TO STRENGTHEN OUR UNIONS BY LETTING THEM DO WHAT THEY DO BEST - ORGANIZE OUR WORKERS . IF A MAJORITY OF WORKERS WANT A UNION , THEY SHOULD GET A UNION . IT'S THAT SIMPLE . WE NEED TO STAND UP TO THE BUSINESS LOBBY THAT'S BEEN GETTING THEIR FRIENDS IN CONGRESS AND IN THE WHITE HOUSE TO BLOCK CARD CHECK . THAT'S WHY I WAS ONE OF THE LEADERS FIGHTING TO PASS THE EMPLOYEE FREE CHOICE ACT . THAT'S WHY I'M FIGHTING FOR IT IN THE SENATE . AND THAT'S WHY WE'LL MAKE IT THE LAW OF THE LAND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT . THERE ARE FEW MORE IMPORTANT UNIONS IN THIS COUNTRY THAN THE UAW . YOU CREATED THE AUTO INDUSTRY . YOU SECURED GOOD-PAYING JOBS FOR GENERATIONS OF WORKERS . AND YOU BUILT THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS - THE BACKBONE OF OUR ECONOMY . SO I KNOW SOMEONE ONCE SAID WHAT'S GOOD FOR GM IS GOOD FOR AMERICA . BUT IT'S TIME WE ALSO RECOGNIZED THAT WHAT'S GOOD FOR THE UAW IS GOOD FOR AMERICA . WE NEED TO HELP YOU COMPETE WITH WORKERS AROUND THE WORLD BY HELPING THE AUTO INDUSTRY COMPETE WITH CAR COMPANIES ALL OVER THE WORLD . YES , THAT MEANS RAISING OUR FUEL STANDARDS SO WE CAN MAKE THE FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS THAT ARE THE FUTURE OF YOUR INDUSTRY . BUT IT ALSO MEANS GIVING YOU THE HELP YOU NEED TO RETOOL YOUR PLANTS SO WE CAN BUILD THESE CARS RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA . AND IF WE CAN DO THAT , WE'LL CREATE THOUSANDS AND THOUSANDS OF JOBS IN THE PROCESS . BUT IF WE'RE SERIOUS ABOUT HELPING YOU COMPETE ABROAD , WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR YOU HERE AT HOME . THAT'S WHY I CALLED MIKE UNKNOWNWORD WITH LOCAL 95 IN WISCONSIN THE DAY THEY DECIDED TO STRIKE GM , AND GAVE HIM MY SUPPORT . AND I MADE THE SAME CALL TO DAN KIRK WITH LOCAL UNKNOWNWORD WHEN CHRYSLER WORKERS WENT ON STRIKE . AND LARRY SHARPE AND HIS MEMBERS IN LOCAL 6 FROM MY HOME STATE OF ILLINOIS CAN'T BE HERE TODAY BECAUSE THEY'RE STRIKING INTERNATIONAL TRUCK AND ENGINE , BUT LARRY KNOWS HE HAS MY SUPPORT . BECAUSE WHEN YOU HIT THE PICKET LINES - WHETHER IT'S WITH GM OR CHRYSLER OR ANYBODY ELSE - YOU AREN'T JUST FIGHTING FOR YOUR OWN RIGHTS , YOU'RE FIGHTING FOR THE RIGHTS OF EVERY AMERICAN WORKER . BUT IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO DO ALL THIS - IT'S GOING TO BE HARD TO MAKE THE UNKNOWNWORD AGENDA AMERICA'S AGENDA - UNTIL WE END THIS WAR IN IRAQ . THIS IS A WAR I OPPOSED IN 2002 . IT'S A WAR I OPPOSED IN 2003 . AND IN 2004 , AND 2005 , AND 2006 . THIS IS A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED AND NEVER BEEN WAGED . AND WE SHOULDN'T COMPOUND THE MISTAKE OF GOING IN BY WAITING ANY LONGER TO PULL OUR TROOPS OUT . THAT'S WHY I'VE CALLED FOR US TO START WITHDRAWING TROOPS NOT NEXT MONTH , NOT NEXT YEAR - NOW . THIS IS A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . THE DREAM THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR FEELS AS IF IT'S SLOWLY SLIPPING AWAY . WE ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS . WE'VE NEVER PAID MORE FOR HEALTH CARE OR FOR COLLEGE . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE AND IT'S HARDER TO RETIRE . AND MOST OF ALL WE'VE LOST FAITH THAT OUR LEADERS CAN OR WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THIS THAT AMERICA IS LISTENING , INTENTLY , TO WHAT MY FELLOW CANDIDATES AND I ARE SAYING - NOT JUST DEMOCRATS , BUT REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO'VE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT , BUT WANT TO BELIEVE AGAIN . SO IN THIS ELECTION , WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A NEW MAJORITY - TO FINALLY TACKLE PROBLEMS THAT GEORGE BUSH MADE FAR WORSE , BUT THAT HAD FESTERED LONG BEFORE GEORGE BUSH EVER TOOK OFFICE - PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR . AND THAT IS WHY THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON TEXTBOOK CAMPAIGNS JUST WON'T DO IN THIS ELECTION . THAT'S WHY NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS BECAUSE WE'RE AFRAID OUR ANSWERS WON'T BE POPULAR JUST WON'T DO . THAT'S WHY TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR INSTEAD OF TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR JUST WON'T DO . TRIANGULATING AND POLL-DRIVEN POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MITT OR RUDY MIGHT SAY ABOUT US JUST WON'T DO . IF WE'RE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WINNING THIS ELECTION , WE CAN'T LIVE IN FEAR OF LOSING IT . THE DEMOCRATIC PARTY HAS ALWAYS MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE'VE LED NOT BY POLLS , BUT BY PRINCIPLE ; NOT BY CALCULATION , BUT BY CONVICTION ; WHEN WE SUMMONED THE ENTIRE NATION TO A COMMON PURPOSE - A HIGHER PURPOSE . AND I RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THAT'S THE PARTY AMERICA NEEDS US TO BE RIGHT NOW . A PARTY THAT OFFERS NOT JUST A DIFFERENCE IN POLICIES , BUT A DIFFERENCE IN LEADERSHIP . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST FOCUS ON HOW TO WIN BUT WHY WE SHOULD . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST OFFER CHANGE AS A SLOGAN , BUT REAL , MEANINGFUL CHANGE - CHANGE THAT AMERICA CAN BELIEVE IN . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . THAT'S WHY I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . NOW , I KNOW WE'VE GOT A LOT OF GOOD CANDIDATES IN THIS RACE , AND I KNOW THEY'RE SAYING THE RIGHT THINGS WHEN THEY COME AND TALK TO YOU . BUT POLITICIANS OFTEN SAY THEY'RE PRO-LABOR AT ELECTION TIME NO MATTER WHAT THEY'VE SAID OR DONE BEFORE . AND THAT LEAVES YOU WONDERING WHAT THEY WILL SAY OR DO AFTER THE ELECTION . SO WHEN A CANDIDATE RAILS AGAINST NAFTA TODAY , IT'S FAIR TO ASK HER WHERE SHE'S BEEN BEFORE . WHEN A CANDIDATE SAYS HE UNKNOWNWORD RIGHT-TO-WORK LAWS OR TRADE RULES THAT HURT WORKERS TODAY , ASK HIM WHERE HE'S BEEN BEFORE . BECAUSE WHAT YOU NEED , WHAT AMERICA NEEDS , IS A PRESIDENT WHO WILL FIGHT FOR YOU WHEN IT'S HARD , AND NOT JUST WHEN IT'S POLITICALLY CONVENIENT . AND THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT I INTEND TO DO . BECAUSE POLITICS DIDN'T LEAD ME TO WORKING FOLKS - WORKING FOLKS LED ME INTO POLITICS . I WAS STANDING WITH AMERICAN WORKERS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO TWENTY YEARS AGO , AND THE REASON I'M HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP ONE DAY MANY YEARS FROM NOW AND SEE THAT WE'RE STILL STANDING BY WHILE AMERICAN JOBS GET SHIPPED OVERSEAS . SO I'M NOT JUST HERE TO GIVE A SPEECH . I DON'T LIKE JUST TALKING ABOUT THE PROBLEMS WE FACE IN THIS COUNTRY . I WANT TO SOLVE THEM . SO I'M HERE TO ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT , REGION 4 . I'M HERE TO ASK YOU TO BELIEVE NOT JUST IN ME , BUT IN YOUR OWN SENSE OF POSSIBILITY , YOUR OWN IMAGINATION ABOUT WHAT AMERICA MIGHT BE . IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHOSE LIFE'S STORY WAS LIKE SO MANY OF YOUR OWN , WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO GO TO COLLEGE ON SCHOLARSHIPS , WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO SEE HIS MOTHER GET SICK AND WORRY THAT MAYBE SHE CAN'T PAY THE MEDICAL BILLS . IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHO KNOWS WHAT IT'S LIKE TO PUT ON A COMFORTABLE PAIR OF SHOES AND WALK WITH YOU ON THAT PICKET LINE . WHO GIVES DENNY WILLIAMS A CALL BEFORE ANY MAJOR PIECE OF LABOR LEGISLATION UNKNOWNWORD HIS DESK , SO EVEN IF WE DON'T SEE EYE TO EYE ON EVERYTHING , YOUR VOICE WILL BE HEARD . IMAGINE AN AMERICA WHERE WE DON'T HAVE TO KEEP PLAYING DEFENSE BECAUSE WE CAN FINALLY PLAY SOME OFFENSE . THAT FUTURE IS WITHIN OUR GRASP . WE CAN BUILD THAT AMERICA TOGETHER IF YOU JOIN ME . BUT EACH OF US HAS TO DO OUR PART . SO I JUST WANT TO CLOSE WITH A STORY ABOUT THE DIFFERENCE THAT ONE VOICE CAN MAKE .
BLUE	THANK YOU SO MUCH . TO THE GREAT GOVERNOR OF IOWA AND LIEUTENANT . GOVERNOR OF IOWA . TO MY DEAR FRIEND TOM HARKIN FOR THE OUTSTANDING WORK THAT HE DOES . TO THE CONGRESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD OF IOWA THAT IS DOING OUTSTANDING WORK AND TO NANCY PELOSI , UNKNOWNWORD SPEAKER , THANK YOU ALL FOR THE WONDERFUL WELCOME AND THE WONDERFUL HOSPITALITY . [RESPONDING TO AUDIENCE]I LOVE YOU BACK . A LITTLE LESS THAN ONE YEAR FROM TODAY , YOU WILL GO INTO THE VOTING BOOTH AND YOU WILL SELECT THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . NOW , HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS - THE NAME GEORGE W . BUSH WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . THE NAME OF MY COUSIN DICK CHENEY WILL NOT BE ON THE BALLOT . WE'VE BEEN TRYING TO HIDE THAT FOR A LONG TIME . EVERYBODY HAS A BLACK SHEEP IN THE FAMILY . THE ERA OF SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE , AND BROWNIE INCOMPETENCE , AND KARL ROVE POLITICS WILL FINALLY BE OVER . BUT THE QUESTION YOU'RE GOING TO HAVE TO ASK YOURSELF WHEN YOU CAUCUS IN JANUARY AND YOU VOTE IN NOVEMBER IS , "WHAT'S NEXT FOR AMERICA ?" WE ARE IN A DEFINING MOMENT IN OUR HISTORY . OUR NATION IS AT WAR . THE PLANET IS IN PERIL . THE DREAM THAT SO MANY GENERATIONS FOUGHT FOR FEELS AS IF IT'S SLOWLY SLIPPING AWAY . WE ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS . WE'VE NEVER PAID MORE FOR HEALTH CARE OR FOR COLLEGE . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE AND IT'S HARDER TO RETIRE . AND MOST OF ALL WE'VE LOST FAITH THAT OUR LEADERS CAN OR WILL DO ANYTHING ABOUT IT . WE WERE PROMISED COMPASSIONATE CONSERVATISM AND ALL WE GOT WAS KATRINA AND WIRETAPS . WE WERE PROMISED A UNITER , AND WE GOT A PRESIDENT WHO COULD NOT EVEN LEAD THE HALF OF THE COUNTRY THAT VOTED FOR HIM . WE WERE PROMISED A MORE ETHICAL AND MORE EFFICIENT GOVERNMENT , AND INSTEAD WE HAVE A TOWN CALLED WASHINGTON THAT IS MORE CORRUPT AND MORE WASTEFUL THAN IT WAS BEFORE . AND THE ONLY MISSION THAT WAS EVER ACCOMPLISHED IS TO USE FEAR AND FALSEHOOD TO TAKE THIS COUNTRY TO A WAR THAT SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED AND SHOULD HAVE NEVER BEEN WAGED . IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT AMERICA IS LISTENING , INTENTLY , TO WHAT WE SAY HERE TODAY - NOT JUST DEMOCRATS , BUT REPUBLICANS AND INDEPENDENTS WHO'VE LOST TRUST IN THEIR GOVERNMENT , BUT WANT TO BELIEVE AGAIN . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE FAILURES THAT WE NOT ONLY HAVE A MOMENT OF GREAT CHALLENGE , BUT ALSO A MOMENT OF GREAT OPPORTUNITY . WE HAVE A CHANCE TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER IN A NEW MAJORITY - TO FINALLY TACKLE PROBLEMS THAT GEORGE BUSH MADE FAR WORSE , BUT THAT HAD FESTERED LONG BEFORE GEORGE BUSH EVER TOOK OFFICE - PROBLEMS THAT WE'VE TALKED ABOUT YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR AFTER YEAR . AND THAT IS WHY THE SAME OLD WASHINGTON TEXTBOOK CAMPAIGNS JUST WON'T DO IN THIS ELECTION . THAT'S WHY NOT ANSWERING QUESTIONS .CAUSE WE ARE AFRAID OUR ANSWERS WON'T BE POPULAR JUST WON'T DO . THAT'S WHY TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR INSTEAD OF TELLING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR JUST WON'T DO . TRIANGULATING AND POLL-DRIVEN POSITIONS BECAUSE WE'RE WORRIED ABOUT WHAT MITT OR RUDY MIGHT SAY ABOUT US JUST WON'T DO . IF WE ARE REALLY SERIOUS ABOUT WINING THIS ELECTION DEMOCRATS , WE CAN'T LIVE IN FEAR OF LOSING IT . THIS PARTY - THE PARTY OF JEFFERSON AND JACKSON ; OF ROOSEVELT AND KENNEDY - HAS ALWAYS MADE THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE LIVES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN WE LED , NOT BY POLLS , BUT BY PRINCIPLE ; NOT BY CALCULATION , BUT BY CONVICTION ; WHEN WE SUMMONED THE ENTIRE NATION TO A COMMON PURPOSE - A HIGHER PURPOSE . AND I RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA BECAUSE THAT'S THE PARTY AMERICA NEEDS US TO BE RIGHT NOW . A PARTY THAT OFFERS NOT JUST A DIFFERENCE IN POLICIES , BUT A DIFFERENCE IN LEADERSHIP . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST FOCUS ON HOW TO WIN BUT WHY WE SHOULD . A PARTY THAT DOESN'T JUST OFFER CHANGE AS A SLOGAN , BUT REAL , MEANINGFUL CHANGE - CHANGE THAT AMERICA CAN BELIEVE IN . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . THAT'S WHY I AM RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA - TO OFFER CHANGE THAT WE CAN BELIEVE IN . I AM IN THIS RACE TO TELL THE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS THAT THEIR DAYS OF SETTING THE AGENDA IN WASHINGTON ARE OVER . I HAVE DONE MORE THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE TO TAKE ON LOBBYISTS - AND WON . THEY HAVE NOT FUNDED MY CAMPAIGN , THEY WILL NOT GET A JOB IN MY WHITE HOUSE , AND THEY WILL NOT DROWN OUT THE VOICES OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I'M IN THIS RACE TO TAKE THOSE TAX BREAKS AWAY FROM COMPANIES THAT ARE MOVING JOBS OVERSEAS AND PUT THEM IN THE POCKETS OF HARD WORKING AMERICANS WHO DESERVE IT . AND I WON'T RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE EVERY TEN YEARS -I WILL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE SO THAT WORKERS DON'T ' FALL BEHIND . THAT IS WHY I AM IN IT . TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN WORKER . TO FIGHT FOR THE AMERICAN WORKER . I'M IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I WANT TO STOP TALKING ABOUT THE OUTRAGE OF 47 MILLION AMERICANS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE AND START ACTUALLY DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT . I EXPANDED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS BY BRINGING DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TOGETHER . BY TAKING ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . AND THAT IS HOW I WILL MAKE CERTAIN THAT EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN IN THIS COUNTRY HAS HEALTH CARE THEY CAN COUNT ON AND I WON'T DO IT TWENTY YEARS FROM NOW , I WON'T DO IT TEN YEARS FROM NOW , I WILL DO IT BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . I RUN FOR PRESIDENT TO MAKE SURE THAT EVERY AMERICAN CHILD HAS THE BEST EDUCATION THAT WE HAVE TO OFFER - FROM THE DAY THEY ARE BORN TO THE DAY THEY GRADUATE FROM COLLEGE . AND I WON'T JUST TALK ABOUT HOW GREAT TEACHERS ARE - AS PRESIDENT I WILL REWARD THEM FOR THEIR GREATNESS - BY RAISING SALARIES AND GIVING THEM MORE SUPPORT . THAT'S WHY I'M IN THIS RACE . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I AM SICK AND TIRED OF DEMOCRATS THINKING THAT THE ONLY WAY TO LOOK TOUGH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IS BY TALKING , AND ACTING , AND VOTING LIKE GEORGE BUSH REPUBLICANS . WHEN I AM THIS PARTY'S NOMINEE , MY OPPONENT WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I VOTED FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ ; OR THAT I GAVE GEORGE BUSH THE BENEFIT OF THE DOUBT ON IRAN ; OR THAT I SUPPORTED BUSH-CHENEY POLICIES OF NOT TALKING TO LEADERS THAT WE DON'T LIKE . AND HE WILL NOT BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAVERED ON SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WHETHER OR NOT IT IS OK FOR AMERICA TO TORTURE - BECAUSE IT IS NEVER OK . THAT'S WHY I AM IN IT . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE WAR IN IRAQ . WE WILL HAVE OUR TROOPS HOME IN SIXTEEN MONTHS . I WILL CLOSE GUANTANAMO . I WILL RESTORE HABEAS CORPUS . I WILL FINISH THE FIGHT AGAINST AL QAEDA . AND I WILL LEAD THE WORLD TO COMBAT THE COMMON THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY - NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORISM ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND DISEASE . AND I WILL SEND ONCE MORE A MESSAGE TO THOSE YEARNING FACES BEYOND OUR SHORES THAT SAYS , "YOU MATTER TO US . YOUR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND OUR MOMENT IS NOW ." AMERICA , OUR MOMENT IS NOW . OUR MOMENT IS NOW . I DON'T WANT TO SPEND THE NEXT YEAR OR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS RE-FIGHTING THE SAME FIGHTS THAT WE HAD IN THE 1990S . I DON'T WANT TO PIT RED AMERICA AGAINST BLUE AMERICA , I WANT TO BE THE PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AND IF THOSE REPUBLICANS COME AT ME WITH THE SAME FEAR-MONGERING AND SWIFT-BOATING THAT THEY USUALLY DO , THEN I WILL TAKE THEM HEAD ON . BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE TIRED OF FEAR AND TIRED OF DISTRACTIONS AND TIRED OF UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN MAKE THIS ELECTION NOT ABOUT FEAR , BUT ABOUT THE FUTURE . AND THAT WON'T JUST BE A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ; THAT WILL BE AN AMERICAN VICTORY . AND THAT IS A VICTORY AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW . I AM NOT IN THIS RACE TO FULFILL SOME LONG-HELD AMBITIONS OR BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT'S SOMEHOW OWED TO ME . I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE , I ALWAYS KNEW THIS JOURNEY WAS IMPROBABLE . I'VE NEVER BEEN ON A JOURNEY THAT WASN'T . I AM RUNNING IN THIS RACE BECAUSE OF WHAT DR . KING CALLED "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW ." BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO LATE . AND THAT HOUR IS ALMOST UPON US . I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP FOUR YEARS FROM NOW AND FIND OUT THAT MILLIONS OF AMERICANS STILL LACK HEALTH CARE BECAUSE WE COULDN'T TAKE ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT THE OCEANS HAVE RISEN A FEW MORE INCHES . THE PLANET HAS REACHED A POINT OF NO RETURN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO STOP BUYING OIL FROM DICTATORS . I DON'T WANT TO SEE MORE AMERICAN LIVES PUT AT RISK BECAUSE NO ONE HAD THE JUDGMENT OR THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AGAINST A MISGUIDED WAR BEFORE WE SENT OUR TROOPS INTO FIGHT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE HOMELESS VETERANS ON THE STREETS . I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANOTHER GENERATION OF AMERICAN CHILDREN TO FAILING SCHOOLS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR MY DAUGHTERS . I DON'T WANT THAT FUTURE FOR YOUR SONS . I DO NOT WANT THAT FUTURE FOR AMERICA . I'M IN THIS RACE FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR JOBS FOR THE JOBLESS AND HOPE FOR THE HOPELESS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO ; FOR THE SAME REASON I FOUGHT FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER ; FOR THE SAME REASON THAT I FOUGHT FOR ILLINOIS FAMILIES FOR OVER A DECADE . BECAUSE I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT THE ONLY REASON THAT I'M STANDING HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE SOMEBODY , SOMEWHERE STOOD UP FOR ME WHEN IT WAS RISKY . STOOD UP WHEN IT WAS HARD . STOOD UP WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR . AND BECAUSE THAT SOMEBODY STOOD UP , A FEW MORE STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW THOUSAND STOOD UP . AND THEN A FEW MILLION STOOD UP . AND STANDING UP , WITH COURAGE AND CLEAR PURPOSE , THEY SOMEHOW MANAGED TO CHANGE THE WORLD . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING , IOWA - TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN THE SAME CHANCES SOMEBODY GAVE ME . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING , DEMOCRATS - TO KEEP THE AMERICAN DREAM ALIVE FOR THOSE WHO STILL HUNGER FOR OPPORTUNITY , WHO STILL THIRST FOR EQUALITY . THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO STAND WITH ME , THAT'S WHY I'M ASKING YOU TO CAUCUS FOR ME , THAT'S WHY I AM ASKING YOU TO STOP SETTLING FOR WHAT THE CYNICS SAY WE HAVE TO ACCEPT . IN THIS ELECTION - IN THIS MOMENT - LET US REACH FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE . A NATION HEALED . A WORLD REPAIRED . AN AMERICA THAT BELIEVES AGAIN . THANK YOU VERY MUCH EVERYBODY .
BLUE	IT'S WONDERFUL TO BE HERE TODAY . I FEEL RIGHT AT HOME IN BETTENDORF , WHICH IS JUST A UNKNOWNWORD THROW FROM MY HOME STATE OF ILLINOIS . BUT THE TRUTH IS , WE SHARE MORE THAN THE BANKS OF A GREAT RIVER . IF YOU SPEND TIME IN WASHINGTON , YOU HEAR A LOT ABOUT THE DIVISIONS IN OUR COUNTRY . ABOUT HOW WE'RE BECOMING MORE UNKNOWNWORD BY GEOGRAPHY AND IDEOLOGY ; RACE AND RELIGION ; WEALTH AND OPPORTUNITY . AND WE'VE HAD PLENTY OF POLITICIANS WHO TRY TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THESE DIVISIONS - PITTING AMERICANS AGAINST ONE ANOTHER , OR TARGETING DIFFERENT MESSAGES TO DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD . BUT AS I'VE TRAVELED AROUND IOWA AND THE REST OF THE COUNTRY THESE LAST NINE MONTHS , I HAVEN'T BEEN STRUCK BY OUR DIFFERENCES - I'VE BEEN IMPRESSED BY THE VALUES AND HOPES THAT WE SHARE . IN BIG CITIES AND SMALL TOWNS ; AMONG MEN AND WOMEN ; YOUNG AND OLD ; BLACK , WHITE , AND BROWN - AMERICANS SHARE A FAITH IN SIMPLE DREAMS . A JOB WITH WAGES THAT CAN SUPPORT A FAMILY . HEALTH CARE THAT WE CAN COUNT ON AND AFFORD . A RETIREMENT THAT IS DIGNIFIED AND SECURE . EDUCATION AND OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR KIDS . COMMON HOPES . AMERICAN DREAMS . THESE ARE DREAMS THAT DROVE MY GRANDPARENTS . AFTER MY GRANDFATHER SERVED IN WORLD WAR II , THE GI BILL GAVE HIM A CHANCE TO GO TO COLLEGE , AND THE GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM A CHANCE TO BUY A HOME . THEY MOVED WEST , WORKED HARD AT DIFFERENT JOBS , AND WERE ABLE TO PROVIDE MY MOTHER WITH A DECENT EDUCATION , TO HELP RAISE ME , AND TO SAVE ENOUGH TO RETIRE . THESE ARE DREAMS THAT DROVE MY FATHER-IN-LAW . A CITY WORKER IN CHICAGO , HE WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS AT THE AGE OF 30 . BUT EVERY DAY , EVEN WHEN HE HAD TO LEAVE AN HOUR EARLIER IN THE MORNING AND RELY ON A WALKER TO GET HIM THERE , HE WENT TO WORK WHILE HIS WIFE STAYED HOME WITH THE KIDS . AND ON THAT SINGLE SALARY , HE PROVIDED FOR HIS FAMILY AND SENT MY WIFE MICHELLE AND HER BROTHER TO COLLEGE . HIS DREAM WAS TO SEE THEM DO BETTER . AND THEY HAVE . THESE ARE DREAMS THAT DROVE MY MOTHER . A SINGLE MOM - EVEN WHILE RELYING ON FOOD STAMPS AS SHE FINISHED HER EDUCATION , SHE FOLLOWED HER PASSION FOR HELPING OTHERS , AND RAISED MY SISTER AND ME TO BELIEVE THAT IN AMERICA THERE ARE NO BARRIERS TO SUCCESS - NO MATTER WHAT COLOR YOU ARE , NO MATTER WHERE YOU'RE FROM , NO MATTER HOW MUCH MONEY YOU HAVE . AND THESE ARE THE DREAMS THAT LED ME TO CHICAGO OVER TWO DECADES AGO TO BECOME A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER . THE SALARY - $12,000 A YEAR - WASN'T WHAT MY FRIENDS WOULD MAKE IN THE CORPORATE WORLD OR AT LAW FIRMS . I DIDN'T KNOW A SINGLE PERSON IN CHICAGO . BUT I KNEW THERE WERE FOLKS WHO NEEDED HELP . THE STEEL PLANT HAD CLOSED . JOBS WERE DISAPPEARING . IN A FORGOTTEN CORNER OF AMERICA , THE AMERICAN DREAM WAS SLIPPING AWAY . AND I KNEW DREAMS ARE WORTH FIGHTING FOR . WHAT IS UNIQUE ABOUT AMERICA IS THAT WE WANT THESE DREAMS FOR MORE THAN OURSELVES - WE WANT THEM FOR EACH OTHER . THAT'S WHY WE CALL IT THE AMERICAN DREAM . WE WANT IT FOR THE KID WHO DOESN'T GO TO COLLEGE BECAUSE SHE CANNOT AFFORD IT ; FOR THE WORKER WHOSE WONDERING IF HIS WAGES WILL PAY THIS WINTER'S HEATING BILL ; FOR 47 MILLION AMERICANS LIVING WITHOUT HEALTH CARE ; FOR THE MILLIONS MORE WHO WORRY IF THEY HAVE ENOUGH TO RETIRE WITH THE DIGNITY THEY HAVE EARNED . WHEN OUR FELLOW AMERICANS ARE DENIED THE AMERICAN DREAM , OUR OWN DREAMS ARE UNKNOWNWORD . AND TODAY , THE COST OF THAT DREAM IS RISING FASTER THAN EVER BEFORE . WHILE SOME HAVE PROSPERED BEYOND IMAGINATION IN THIS GLOBAL ECONOMY , MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS - AS WELL AS THOSE WORKING HARD TO BECOME MIDDLE CLASS - ARE SEEING THE AMERICAN DREAM SLIP FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY . YOU KNOW IT FROM YOUR OWN LIVES . AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS AND PAYING MORE FOR HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE . FOR MOST FOLKS , ONE INCOME ISN'T ENOUGH TO RAISE A FAMILY AND SEND YOUR KIDS TO COLLEGE . SOMETIMES , TWO INCOMES AREN'T ENOUGH . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE . IT'S HARDER TO RETIRE . YOU'RE DOING YOUR PART , YOU'RE MEETING YOUR RESPONSIBILITIES , BUT IT ALWAYS SEEMS LIKE YOU'RE TREADING WATER OR FALLING BEHIND . AND AS I SEE THIS EVERY DAY ON THE CAMPAIGN TRAIL , I'M REMINDED OF HOW UNLIKELY IT IS THAT THE DREAMS OF MY FAMILY COULD BE REALIZED TODAY I DON'T ACCEPT THIS FUTURE . WE NEED TO RECLAIM THE AMERICAN DREAM . AND THAT STARTS WITH RECLAIMING THE WHITE HOUSE FROM GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY . WE'RE TIRED OF TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY THAT SHIFT THE BURDEN ONTO THE BACKS OF WORKING PEOPLE . WE'RE TIRED OF WAITING TEN YEARS FOR THE MINIMUM WAGE TO GO UP WHILE CEO PAY IS SOARING . WE'RE TIRED OF MORE AMERICANS GOING WITHOUT HEALTH CARE , OF MORE AMERICANS FALLING INTO POVERTY , OF MORE AMERICAN KIDS WHO HAVE THE BRAINS AND THE DRIVE TO GO TO COLLEGE - BUT CAN'T - BECAUSE THEY CAN'T AFFORD IT . WE'RE READY FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO END , BECAUSE WE ARE SICK AND TIRED OF BEING SICK AND TIRED . BUT THIS IS ABOUT MORE THAN GEORGE BUSH . HE'S JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE CHANGE THAT WE NEED . THESE PROBLEMS DIDN'T START WHEN HE CAME TO OFFICE AND THEY WON'T END JUST BECAUSE HE'S LEAVING . WE'RE NOT GOING TO RECLAIM THAT DREAM UNLESS WE PUT AN END TO THE POLITICS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND DIVISION THAT IS HOLDING THIS COUNTRY BACK ; UNLESS WE STAND UP TO THE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS THAT HAVE STOOD IN THE WAY OF PROGRESS ; UNLESS WE HAVE LEADERSHIP THAT DOESN'T JUST TELL PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR - BUT TELLS EVERYONE WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE NEED . I BELIEVE THAT AMERICANS WANT TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN BEHIND A COMMON PURPOSE . AMERICANS WANT TO RECLAIM OUR AMERICAN DREAM . THAT'S WHY I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . IT'S THE SAME REASON I PACKED UP MY CAR AND MOVED TO CHICAGO . BECAUSE IN THIS COUNTRY , THAT DREAM IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR - NOT JUST FOR OURSELVES , BUT FOR EACH OTHER . AND THAT'S WHY I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SETTLE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO'S ONLY THERE FOR YOU WHEN IT'S EASY OR CONVENIENT OR POPULAR - I THINK YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO YOU CAN TRUST WILL FIGHT FOR YOUR DREAMS EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE NEED . THIS STARTS WITH AN ECONOMY THAT WORKS FOR WORKING PEOPLE . AMERICANS DON'T EXPECT GOVERNMENT TO SOLVE ALL OUR PROBLEMS . BUT YOU'RE TIRED OF A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR SPECIAL INTERESTS , AND NOT FOR YOU . IT'S TIME THAT WE HAD LEADERSHIP THAT WORRIED AS MUCH ABOUT MAIN STREET AS IT DOES ABOUT WALL STREET . THAT'S WHY I'M INTRODUCING AN AMERICAN DREAM AGENDA - TO PUT SOME WIND AT THE BACKS OF WORKING PEOPLE , TO LOWER THE COST OF GETTING AHEAD , AND TO PROTECT AND EXTEND OPPORTUNITY FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS . WE NEED TO GIVE WORKING FAMILIES A BREAK . FOR TWENTY-FIVE YEARS , WE'VE SEEN GAPS IN WEALTH GROW LARGER , WHILE OUR TAX CODE THAT FAVORS WEALTH OVER WORK . THAT'S WHY I'VE PROPOSED AN INCOME TAX CUT TO OFFSET THE PAYROLL TAX THAT WORKING AMERICANS ARE ALREADY PAYING . THIS WILL BE WORTH UP TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR A WORKING FAMILY . I'LL MAKE RETIREMENT MORE SECURE FOR AMERICA'S SENIORS BY ELIMINATING INCOME TAXES FOR ANY RETIREE MAKING LESS THAN $50,000 PER YEAR . AND I WON'T WAIT TEN YEARS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE - I'LL GUARANTEE THAT IT GOES UP EVERY SINGLE YEAR . THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT WORKING AMERICANS NEED . WE KNOW THAT THE COST OF THE AMERICAN DREAM MUST NEVER COME AT THE EXPENSE OF THE AMERICAN FAMILY . YOU'RE WORKING LONGER HOURS . MORE FAMILIES HAVE TWO PARENTS WORKING . MEANWHILE , IT'S HARD TO GET A HAND . IT'S EVEN HARDER TO GET A BREAK . THAT'S WHY I'LL DOUBLE SPENDING ON QUALITY AFTER-SCHOOL PROGRAMS - SO THAT YOU CAN KNOW YOUR KIDS ARE SAFE AND SECURE . AND THAT'S WHY I'LL EXPAND THE FAMILY MEDICAL LEAVE ACT TO INCLUDE MORE BUSINESSES AND MILLIONS MORE WORKERS ; TO LET PARENTS PARTICIPATE IN SCHOOL ACTIVITIES WITH THEIR KIDS ; AND TO COVER ELDERLY CARE . AND WE'LL FINALLY PUT FEDERAL SUPPORT BEHIND STATE EFFORTS TO PROVIDE PAID FAMILY AND MEDICAL LEAVE . WE ALSO NEED TO CHANGE A SYSTEM THAT IS STACKED AGAINST WOMEN . FORTY PERCENT OF WORKING WOMEN DO NOT HAVE A SINGLE PAID SICK DAY . MORE AND MORE WOMEN ARE DENIED JOBS OR PROMOTIONS BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT KIDS AT HOME . AS THE SON OF A SINGLE MOTHER , THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I BELIEVE IN . I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO STANDS UP FOR WORKING PARENTS . WE'LL REQUIRE EMPLOYERS TO PROVIDE SEVEN PAID SICK DAYS EACH YEAR . WE'LL ENFORCE LAWS THAT PROHIBIT CAREGIVER DISCRIMINATION . AND WE'LL ENCOURAGE UNKNOWNWORD WORK SCHEDULES TO BETTER BALANCE WORK AND PARENTING FOR MOTHERS AND FATHERS . THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT WORKING FAMILIES NEED . WE ALSO NEED A HOUSING MARKET THAT IS HONEST , OPEN AND ACCOUNTABLE . I'VE INTRODUCED A BILL IN THE SENATE THAT CRACKS DOWN ON MORTGAGE FRAUD . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL GET TOUGH ON ENFORCEMENT AND RAISE PENALTIES ON LENDERS WHO HAVE BROKEN THE RULES . FOR HOMEOWNERS FACING FORECLOSURE THROUGH NO FAULT OF THEIR OWN , WE'LL CREATE A FUND AND REFORM BANKRUPTCY LAWS TO GIVE THEM A SHOT AT UNKNOWNWORD FORECLOSURE . WE'LL MANDATE THAT PROSPECTIVE HOMEBUYERS HAVE ACCESS TO UNKNOWNWORD AND COMPLETE INFORMATION ABOUT THEIR MORTGAGE OPTIONS . AND WE'LL GIVE MIDDLE CLASS HOMEOWNERS ADDED RELIEF BY PROVIDING A TAX CREDIT THAT COVERS 10 PERCENT OF A FAMILY'S MORTGAGE INTEREST PAYMENT EACH YEAR . THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT AMERICA'S HOMEOWNERS NEED . SINCE MANY PEOPLE WHO HOLD SUBPRIME MORTGAGES ARE UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEBT TO CREDIT CARDS , WE HAVE TO MAKE SURE THAT THEY UNDERSTAND THEIR COMMITMENTS - OTHERWISE CREDIT CARDS COULD BE THE NEXT STAGE IN THE SUBPRIME CRISIS . TO MAKE SURE THAT AMERICANS KNOW WHAT THEY'RE SIGNING UP FOR , I'LL INSTITUTE A FIVE-STAR RATING SYSTEM TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK INVOLVED IN EVERY CREDIT CARD . AND WE'LL ESTABLISH A CREDIT CARD BILL OF RIGHTS THAT WILL BAN UNILATERAL CHANGES TO A CREDIT CARD AGREEMENT ; BAN RATE CHANGES TO DEBT THAT'S ALREADY INCURRED ; AND BAN INTEREST ON LATE FEES . AMERICANS NEED TO PAY WHAT THEY OWE , BUT THEY SHOULD PAY WHAT'S FAIR . THIS SAME PRINCIPLE OF FAIRNESS IS NEEDED IN OUR BANKRUPTCY LAWS . FOR FAR TOO LONG , THE SAME POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON WHO HAVE BEEN CUTTING BACK THE SAFETY NET FOR WORKING PEOPLE HAVE BEEN PROTECTING GOLDEN PARACHUTES FOR THE WELL-OFF - SO WORKERS LOSE THEIR PENSIONS AND THEIR HEALTH CARE , WHILE CEOS GET MULTI-MILLION DOLLAR PAYOFFS . I FOUGHT AGAINST A BANKRUPTCY REFORM BILL IN THE SENATE THAT DID MORE TO PROTECT CREDIT CARD COMPANIES AND BANKS THAN TO HELP WORKING PEOPLE . I'LL CONTINUE THE FIGHT FOR GOOD BANKRUPTCY LAWS AS PRESIDENT . NO MORE BONUSES FOR EXECUTIVES WHILE PENSIONS DISAPPEAR . WE'LL PRESS FIRMS TO PUT MORE MONEY INTO THEIR PENSION FUNDS , AND REQUIRE FIRMS TO DISCLOSE THEIR PENSION FUND INVESTMENTS . AND WE'LL INCREASE THE AMOUNT OF WAGES AND BENEFITS THAT WORKERS CAN CLAIM IN BANKRUPTCY COURT . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE NEED IN OUR BANKRUPTCY LAWS . AND IF YOU CAN DEMONSTRATE THAT YOU WENT BANKRUPT BECAUSE OF MEDICAL EXPENSES , THEN THERE MUST BE A PROCESS THAT UNKNOWNWORD THAT DEBT AND LETS YOU GET BACK ON YOUR FEET . I DON'T ACCEPT AN AMERICA WHERE WE LET SOMEONE GO OVER A CLIFF JUST BECAUSE THEY GET SICK . THAT IS NOT WHO WE ARE . EVERY FOUR YEARS POLITICIANS COME BEFORE YOU TO TALK ABOUT HEALTH CARE . YOU HEAR THE SAME PROMISES . AND THEN YOU SEE THE SAME RESULTS . WELL IT'S TIME TO END THE OUTRAGE OF 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS . IT'S TIME TO FINALLY DO SOMETHING ABOUT IT . I REFORMED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS , AND I DIDN'T DO IT ALONE - I DID IT BY REACHING OUT TO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS . WE TOOK ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY , AND WE WON . THAT'S HOW I'LL PASS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE BILL THAT CUTS A TYPICAL FAMILY'S PREMIUMS BY UP TO $2500 . AND MARK MY WORDS - I WILL SIGN THIS BILL BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT . THAT'S THE CHANGE THAT AMERICA IS WAITING FOR . AND HEALTH CARE ISN'T THE ONLY COST THAT WE'RE NOT KEEPING UP WITH . AMERICANS WHO WORK HARD THEIR ENTIRE LIVES HAVE EARNED A SECURE RETIREMENT . BUT RIGHT NOW , WE'VE GOT 75 MILLION WORKING PEOPLE IN THIS COUNTRY WHO DON'T HAVE EMPLOYER-BASED RETIREMENT PLANS . PERSONAL SAVING IS AT AN ALL-TIME LOW . A PART OF THE AMERICAN DREAM IS AT RISK . THAT'S WHY I'LL ESTABLISH AN AUTOMATIC WORKPLACE PENSION POLICY . EMPLOYERS WILL BE REQUIRED TO ENROLL WORKERS IN A DIRECT DEPOSIT RETIREMENT ACCOUNT THAT PLACES A SMALL PERCENTAGE OF EACH PAYCHECK INTO THE ACCOUNT . THEN YOU'LL HAVE THE CHOICE OF OPTING OUT , MATCHING , OR ADDING TO THIS ACCOUNT . WHEN YOU CHANGE JOBS , YOUR SAVINGS WILL ROLL OVER INTO YOUR NEW EMPLOYER'S SYSTEM , OR INTO A SYSTEM THAT YOU CONTROL IF YOU LEAVE THE WORKPLACE OR BECOME SELF-EMPLOYED . AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL MATCH SAVINGS FOR WORKING FAMILIES . THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY INCREASE THE NUMBER OF AMERICANS WHO SAVE FOR RETIREMENT , AND LIFT UP THE AMOUNT OF SAVINGS IN THIS COUNTRY . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE NEED TO HELP AMERICANS ACHIEVE THE RETIREMENT THEY ARE WORKING FOR . BUT WE NEED TO DO MORE THAN PUT THE AMERICAN DREAM ON A FIRMER FOUNDATION . EVERY AMERICAN HAS THE RIGHT TO PURSUE THEIR DREAMS . BUT WE ALSO HAVE THE RESPONSIBILITY TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR CHILDREN CAN REACH A LITTLE FURTHER AND RISE A LITTLE HIGHER THAN WE DID . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE WILL STOP PASSING BILLS CALLED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND THAT LEAVE THE MONEY BEHIND , AND START MAKING REAL INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION . THAT MEANS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION . THAT MEANS RECRUITING AN ARMY OF NEW TEACHERS , AND PAYING THEM BETTER , AND SUPPORTING THEM MORE SO THEY'RE NOT JUST TEACHING TO TEST , BUT TEACHING TO TEACH . IT ALSO MEANS PUTTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION WITHIN REACH OF EVERY AMERICAN . THAT'S THE BEST INVESTMENT WE CAN MAKE IN OUR FUTURE . I'LL CREATE A NEW AND FULLY REFUNDABLE TAX CREDIT WORTH $4,000 FOR TUITION AND FEES EVERY YEAR , WHICH WILL COVER TWO-THIRDS OF THE TUITION AT THE AVERAGE PUBLIC COLLEGE OR UNIVERSITY . I'LL ALSO SIMPLIFY THE FINANCIAL AID APPLICATION PROCESS SO THAT WE DON'T HAVE A MILLION STUDENTS WHO AREN'T APPLYING FOR AID BECAUSE IT'S TOO DIFFICULT . I WILL START BY ELIMINATING THE CURRENT STUDENT AID FORM ALTOGETHER - WE'LL USE TAX DATA INSTEAD . AND I'LL TAP THE TREMENDOUS RESOURCE OF COMMUNITY COLLEGES , WHICH EDUCATE HALF THE UNDERGRADUATES IN THIS COUNTRY , BY CREATING A NEW COMMUNITY COLLEGE PARTNERSHIP PROGRAM . WE'LL HELP SCHOOLS DETERMINE WHAT SKILLS AND TECHNICAL EDUCATION ARE NEEDED TO HELP LOCAL INDUSTRY ; WE'LL EXPAND NEW DEGREES FOR EMERGING FIELDS ; AND WE'LL REWARD SCHOOLS THAT GRADUATE MORE STUDENTS . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE NEED SO THAT OUR YOUNG PEOPLE CAN ACHIEVE THEIR DREAMS . THIS IS WHAT WE MUST DO TO RECLAIM THE AMERICAN DREAM . WE KNOW IT WON'T BE EASY . WE'LL HEAR FROM THE CAN'T-DO , WON'T-DO , WON'T-EVEN-TRY CROWD IN WASHINGTON ; THE SPECIAL INTERESTS AND THEIR LOBBYISTS ; THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT SAYS THIS COUNTRY IS JUST TOO DIVIDED TO MAKE PROGRESS . WELL I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO CONFORM TO THIS CONVENTIONAL THINKING - I'M RUNNING TO CHALLENGE IT . THERE IS TOO MUCH AT STAKE . TOO MUCH AT STAKE FOR THE FAMILY THAT CAN'T GET AHEAD ; THE ELDERLY WORKER WHO FACES A RETIREMENT FILLED WITH WORRY ; THE KID WHO DOESN'T BELIEVE AMERICA HAS A PLACE FOR HER DREAMS . TO STAND UP FOR THESE AMERICANS , I DON'T WANT TO SETTLE FOR ANYTHING LESS THAN REAL CHANGE , FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE - CHANGE WE NEED - CHANGE THAT WE CAN BELIEVE IN . IT'S CHANGE THAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SINCE I MOVED OUT TO CHICAGO OVER TWO DECADES AGO . BECAUSE THOSE DREAMS - AMERICAN DREAMS - ARE WORTH FIGHTING FOR . AND BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE STANDING ON THIS STAGE TODAY IF IT WEREN'T FOR THE DREAMS OF THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE ME . THE DREAMS OF MY GRANDFATHER - WHO MARCHED IN PATTON'S ARMY AND MOVED HIS FAMILY WEST IN SEARCH OF OPPORTUNITY . THE DREAMS OF MY GRANDMOTHER - WHO WAS UP AT DAWN AND WORKED TWICE AS HARD AT HER JOB BECAUSE A WOMAN HAD TO WORK HARDER TO GET AHEAD . THE DREAMS OF MY FATHER WHO CROSSED AN OCEAN BECAUSE AMERICA OFFERED THAT LIGHT TO THE WORLD . THE DREAMS OF MY MOTHER - A SINGLE MOM WHO UNDERSTOOD THAT A LIFE RICH IN FAMILY AND EXPERIENCE WAS MORE IMPORTANT THAN A LIFE OF RICHES . THE DREAMS OF THOSE MEN AND WOMEN ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO , WHO FOUGHT WITH ME TO CREATE A FUTURE FOR THEIR COMMUNITY AFTER THE STEEL PLANT WAS SHUTTERED . THERE HAS BEEN A LOT OF TALK IN THIS CAMPAIGN ABOUT THE POLITICS OF HOPE . BUT THE POLITICS OF HOPE DOESN'T MEAN HOPING THAT THINGS COME EASY . IT'S A POLITICS OF BELIEVING IN THINGS UNKNOWNWORD ; OF BELIEVING IN WHAT THIS COUNTRY MIGHT BE ; AND OF STANDING UP FOR THAT BELIEF AND FIGHTING FOR IT WHEN IT'S HARD . AMERICA IS THE SUM OF OUR DREAMS . AND WHAT BINDS US TOGETHER , WHAT MAKES US ONE AMERICAN FAMILY , IS THAT WE STAND UP AND FIGHT FOR EACH OTHER'S DREAMS , THAT WE REAFFIRM THAT FUNDAMENTAL BELIEF - I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER , I AM MY SISTER'S KEEPER - THROUGH OUR POLITICS , OUR POLICIES , AND IN OUR DAILY LIVES . IT'S TIME TO DO THAT ONCE MORE . IT'S TIME TO RECLAIM THE AMERICAN DREAM .
BLUE	ONE YEAR FROM NOW , YOU WILL HAVE THE CHANCE TO WALK INTO A VOTING BOOTH , PULL BACK THE CURTAIN , AND CHOOSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . HERE'S THE GOOD NEWS - FOR THE FIRST TIME IN A LONG TIME , THE NAME GEORGE BUSH WILL NOT APPEAR ON THE BALLOT . THE NAME DICK CHENEY WILL NOT APPEAR ON THE BALLOT . THE ERA OF SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE , AND BROWNIE INCOMPETENCE , AND THE KARL ROVE POLITICS OF FEAR AND CYNICISM WILL BE OVER . BUT THE QUESTION YOU WILL HAVE TO ASK YOURSELVES WHEN YOU PICK UP YOUR BALLOT A YEAR FROM TODAY IS , "WHAT NEXT ?" HOW DO WE REPAIR THE ENORMOUS DAMAGE OF THESE DISMAL YEARS AND RECAPTURE THAT SENSE OF COMMON PURPOSE THAT HAS SEEN AMERICA THROUGH OUR TOUGHEST TIMES ? I'M RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT BECAUSE I BELIEVE WE FIND OURSELVES IN A MOMENT OF GREAT CHALLENGE AND GREAT PROMISE - A MOMENT THAT COMES ALONG ONCE IN A GENERATION . IT'S A MOMENT OF CHALLENGE BECAUSE AMERICA IS LESS SAFE AND LESS RESPECTED THAN AT ANY TIME IN RECENT HISTORY . WE ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON OIL FROM DICTATORS AND CLOSER TO THE DAY WHEN CLIMATE CHANGE BECOMES A CLIMATE CATASTROPHE . IN THE MIDST OF GREAT PROSPERITY , FAMILIES ALL ACROSS THIS COUNTRY FEEL FURTHER FROM THE AMERICAN DREAM . YOU KNOW THIS FROM YOUR OWN LIVES . MOST AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER FOR LESS AND PAYING MORE FOR HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE THAN EVER BEFORE . IT'S HARDER TO SAVE . HARDER TO RETIRE . AND THE POLICIES OF THE LAST SEVEN YEARS HAVE ADDED TO THAT UNKNOWNWORD . GEORGE BUSH SAID WHATEVER THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT REQUIRED IN ORDER TO GET ELECTED IN 2000 . AND THOSE SEVEN YEARS OF BROKEN PROMISES HAVE LEFT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WITH LESS TRUST IN THEIR LEADERS AND LESS FAITH IN THEIR GOVERNMENT THAN THEY HAVE IN YEARS . WE WERE PROMISED COMPASSION AND CONSERVATISM BUT WE GOT KATRINA AND WIRETAPS . WE WERE PROMISED A UNITER , BUT WE GOT A DIVIDER WHO COULDN'T EVEN LEAD THE HALF OF THE COUNTRY WHO VOTED FOR HIM . WE WERE PROMISED A KINDER , GENTLER WASHINGTON BUT GOT A TOWN THAT'S MORE BITTER , SECRETIVE , AND CORRUPT THAN EVER BEFORE . AND THE ONLY MISSION EVER ACCOMPLISHED WAS USING FEAR AND UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE US TO A WAR THAT SHOULD'VE NEVER BEEN AUTHORIZED AND NEVER BEEN WAGED . THIS CATASTROPHIC FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP HAS LED US TO A MOMENT WHERE IT'S NOT JUST DEMOCRATS WHO ARE LISTENING TO WHAT WE HAVE TO SAY , BUT INDEPENDENTS AND REPUBLICANS WHO HAVE NEVER BEEN MORE DISILLUSIONED WITH WHAT THE STATE OF OUR LEADERSHIP IN WASHINGTON HAS DONE TO THIS COUNTRY . THAT'S WHY THIS IS ALSO A MOMENT OF GREAT PROMISE . IT'S A CHANCE TO TURN THE PAGE BY OFFERING THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A FUNDAMENTALLY DIFFERENT CHOICE IN 2008 - NOT JUST IN THE POLICIES WE OFFER , BUT IN THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP WE OFFER . IT'S A CHANCE TO COME TOGETHER AND FINALLY SOLVE THE CHALLENGES THAT WERE MADE WORSE BY GEORGE BUSH , BUT EXISTED LONG BEFORE HE TOOK OFFICE - CHALLENGES LIKE HEALTH CARE AND ENERGY AND EDUCATION THAT WE HAVEN'T MET FOR DECADES BECAUSE OF A POLITICAL SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON THAT HAS FAILED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AND THAT'S WHAT THIS DEBATE IN OUR PARTY RIGHT NOW IS ALL ABOUT . MUCH HAS BEEN SAID ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN SENATOR CLINTON AND MYSELF THIS WEEK . NOW , UNDERSTAND THAT HILLARY CLINTON IS A COLLEAGUE AND A FRIEND . SHE'S ALSO A SKILLED POLITICIAN , AND SHE'S RUN WHAT WASHINGTON WOULD CALL A "TEXTBOOK " CAMPAIGN . BUT THE PROBLEM IS THE TEXTBOOK ITSELF . IT'S A TEXTBOOK THAT'S ALL ABOUT WINNING ELECTIONS , BUT SAYS NOTHING ABOUT HOW TO BRING THE COUNTRY TOGETHER TO SOLVE PROBLEMS . AS WE SAW IN THE DEBATE LAST WEEK , IT ENCOURAGES VAGUE , CALCULATED ANSWERS TO SUIT THE POLITICS OF THE MOMENT , INSTEAD OF CLEAR , CONSISTENT PRINCIPLES ABOUT HOW YOU WOULD LEAD AMERICA . IT TEACHES YOU THAT YOU CAN PROMISE PROGRESS FOR EVERYDAY PEOPLE WHILE STRIKING A BARGAIN WITH THE VERY SPECIAL INTERESTS WHO CROWD THEM OUT . NOW , SENATOR CLINTON IS CERTAINLY NOT THE ONLY ONE IN WASHINGTON TO PLAY THIS GAME . IT'S GONE ON FOR YEARS , AND I UNDERSTAND THE REASONING BEHIND IT . IT'S A GAME THAT USUALLY GETS POLITICIANS WHERE THEY NEED TO GO . BUT I DON'T BELIEVE IT GETS AMERICA WHERE WE NEED TO GO . WHEN IT COMES TO ISSUES LIKE WAR AND DIPLOMACY ; ENERGY AND HEALTH CARE , I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN BRING ABOUT REAL CHANGE IF ALL WE DO IS CHANGE OUR POSITIONS BASED ON WHAT'S POPULAR OR POLITICALLY CONVENIENT . IF WE ARE GOING TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT OF CHALLENGE AND PROMISE , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE DESERVE MORE WHEN THEY HEAD TO THE VOTING BOOTH IN 2008 . I BELIEVE THAT OUR PARTY HAS MADE THE MOST DIFFERENCE IN PEOPLE'S LIVES AND THE LIFE OF THIS COUNTRY WHEN WE HAVE LED NOT BY POLLS BUT BY PRINCIPLE ; NOT BY CALCULATION BUT BY CONVICTION ; WHEN WE'VE BEEN ABLE TO SUMMON THE ENTIRE NATION TO A COMMON PURPOSE - A HIGHER PURPOSE . THAT'S HOW ROOSEVELT LED US THROUGH WAR AND LIFTED US FROM DEPRESSION . IT'S HOW KENNEDY CALLED ON A NEW GENERATION TO ASK WHAT THEY COULD DO FOR AMERICA . AND I AM RUNNING FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES BECAUSE THAT'S THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP AMERICA NEEDS RIGHT NOW . I DON'T PRETEND TO BE A PERFECT MAN , AND I WILL NOT BE A PERFECT PRESIDENT . BUT I AM IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT IF WE WANT TO BREAK FROM THE FAILURES OF THE PAST AND FINALLY MAKE PROGRESS AS A COUNTRY , WE CAN'T KEEP TELLING DIFFERENT PEOPLE WHAT WE THINK THEY WANT TO HEAR - WE HAVE TO TELL EVERY AMERICAN WHAT THEY NEED TO KNOW . WE HAVE TO BE HONEST ABOUT THE CHALLENGES WE FACE . WHEN I CALLED FOR HIGHER FUEL STANDARDS SO WE COULD REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL , I DIDN'T SAY IT TO SOME ENVIRONMENTAL GROUP IN CALIFORNIA - I SAID IT IN FRONT OF AUTOMAKERS IN DETROIT . WHEN I CALLED FOR CORPORATE RESPONSIBILITY SO THAT MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS COULD GET A TAX CUT , I SAID IT IN FRONT OF CEOS ON WALL STREET . AND WHEN I WAS INVITED TO SPEAK OUT AGAINST GEORGE BUSH'S PLAN TO INVADE IRAQ AS A SENATE CANDIDATE FIVE YEARS AGO , I DIDN'T LISTEN TO THOSE WHO WARNED ME THAT IT WAS POLITICALLY RISKY POSITION TO TAKE , I LISTENED TO MY GUT , AND I SAID LOUD AND CLEAR THAT THIS WAS THE WRONG WAR AT THE WRONG TIME AND CONGRESS SHOULD STAND UP AND SAY SO . THAT'S THE KIND OF LEADERSHIP WE NEED RIGHT NOW . THAT'S WHY I'M THIS RACE . BECAUSE I DON'T THINK YOU SHOULD SETTLE FOR A PRESIDENT WHO'S ONLY THERE FOR YOU WHEN IT'S EASY OR CONVENIENT OR POPULAR - I THINK YOU DESERVE A PRESIDENT WHO'S WILLING TO FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY HOUR OF EVERY DAY FOR THE NEXT FOUR YEARS . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 - NOT CHANGE AS A SLOGAN , BUT CHANGE WE CAN BELIEVE IN . ONE YEAR FROM NOW , WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TELL ALL THOSE CORPORATE LOBBYISTS THAT THE DAYS OF THEM SETTING THE AGENDA IN WASHINGTON ARE OVER . I HAVE DONE MORE TO TAKE ON LOBBYISTS THAN ANY OTHER CANDIDATE IN THIS RACE - AND I'VE WON . I DON'T TAKE A DIME OF THEIR MONEY , AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THEY WON'T FIND A JOB IN MY WHITE HOUSE . BECAUSE REAL CHANGE ISN'T ANOTHER FOUR YEARS OF DEFENDING LOBBYISTS WHO DON'T REPRESENT REAL AMERICANS - IT'S STANDING WITH WORKING AMERICANS WHO HAVE SEEN THEIR JOBS DISAPPEAR AND THEIR WAGES DECLINE AND THEIR HOPE FOR THE FUTURE SLIP FURTHER AND FURTHER AWAY . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO COMPANIES THAT SHIP OUR JOBS OVERSEAS , AND I WILL PUT THE MONEY IN THE POCKETS OF WORKING AMERICANS , AND SENIORS , AND HOMEOWNERS WHO DESERVE A BREAK . I WON'T WAIT TEN YEARS TO RAISE THE MINIMUM WAGE - I'LL RAISE IT TO KEEP PACE EVERY SINGLE YEAR . AND IF AMERICAN WORKERS ARE BEING DENIED THEIR RIGHT TO ORGANIZE WHEN I'M IN THE WHITE HOUSE , I WILL PUT ON A COMFORTABLE PAIR OF SHOES AND I WILL WALK ON THAT PICKET LINE WITH YOU AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . ONE YEAR FROM NOW , WE CAN STOP CAMPAIGNING ON THE OUTRAGE OF 47 MILLION UNINSURED AMERICANS AND FINALLY START DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT . I REFORMED HEALTH CARE IN ILLINOIS , AND I DIDN'T DO IT ALONE - I DID IT BY REACHING OUT TO DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS . WE TOOK ON THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY , AND WE WON . THAT'S HOW I'LL PASS A UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE BILL THAT ALLOWS EVERY AMERICAN TO GET THE SAME KIND OF HEALTH CARE THAT MEMBERS OF CONGRESS GET FOR THEMSELVES AND CUTS EVERY FAMILY'S PREMIUMS BY UP TO $2500 . AND MARK MY WORDS - I WILL SIGN THIS BILL BY THE END OF MY FIRST TERM AS PRESIDENT . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 . ONE YEAR FROM NOW , WE CAN STOP SENDING OUR CHILDREN DOWN CORRIDORS OF SHAME AND START PUTTING THEM ON A PATHWAY TO SUCCESS . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE WILL STOP PASSING BILLS CALLED NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND THAT LEAVE THE MONEY BEHIND AND START MAKING REAL INVESTMENTS IN EDUCATION FROM CRADLE TO ADULTHOOD . THAT MEANS EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION . THAT MEANS RECRUITING AN ARMY OF NEW TEACHERS , AND PAYING THEM BETTER , AND SUPPORTING THEM MORE SO THEY'RE NOT JUST TEACHING TO TEST , BUT TEACHING TO TEACH . AND IT MEANS FINALLY PUTTING A COLLEGE EDUCATION WITHIN REACH OF EVERY AMERICAN . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 . ONE YEAR FROM NOW , WE CAN STOP SENDING HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO DICTATORS FOR THEIR OIL WHILE WE MELT THE UNKNOWNWORD ICE CAPS IN THE BARGAIN . I WILL RAISE OUR FUEL STANDARDS , AND PUT A CAP ON CARBON EMISSIONS TO REDUCE THEN 80 % BY 2050 . WE'LL TELL POLLUTERS THAT THEY HAVE TO PAY FOR THEIR POLLUTION , BECAUSE THEY DON'T OWN THE SKIES , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE OWN THE SKIES . AND WE'LL USE THE MONEY TO INVEST IN THE CLEAN , RENEWABLE FUELS THAT ARE OUR FUTURE . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 . IN THIS ELECTION , WE HAVE THE CHANCE TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE LAST SIX YEARS OF BEING TOLD THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO LOOK TOUGH ON NATIONAL SECURITY IS TO TALK , AND ACT , AND VOTE LIKE GEORGE BUSH REPUBLICANS . WHEN I'M YOUR NOMINEE , MY OPPONENT WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I WAS FOR THE WAR IN IRAQ BEFORE I WAS AGAINST IT ; OR THAT I SUPPORTED AN EXTENSION OF THE IRAQ WAR INTO IRAN ; OR THAT I SUPPORT THE BUSH-CHENEY DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING TO LEADERS WE DON'T LIKE . AND HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I UNKNOWNWORD ON SOMETHING AS FUNDAMENTAL AS WHETHER OUR NATION SHOULD USE TORTURE . BECAUSE WE ARE NOT A NATION THAT MAKES EXCUSES FOR TORTURE , WE ARE A NATION THAT REJECTS IT . THAT'S THE CHANGE WE CAN OFFER IN 2008 . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL END THIS WAR IN IRAQ . I WILL BRING OUR TROOPS HOME WITHIN SIXTEEN MONTHS . I'LL FINISH THE FIGHT AGAINST AL QAEDA IN AFGHANISTAN . AND I WILL LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST THE COMMON THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY - NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND TERRORISM ; CLIMATE CHANGE AND POVERTY ; GENOCIDE AND DISEASE . THAT'S WHAT DEMOCRATS MUST STAND FOR , AND THAT'S WHAT AMERICA MUST STAND FOR . AND I'LL BE A PRESIDENT WHO FINALLY SENDS A MESSAGE TO THE BLACK , WHITE , AND BROWN FACES BEYOND OUR SHORES ; FROM THE HALLS OF POWER TO THE HUTS OF AFRICA THAT SAYS , "YOU MATTER TO AMERICA . YOUR FUTURE IS OUR FUTURE . AND OUR MOMENT IS NOW ." AMERICA , OUR MOMENT IS NOW . NOW IS OUR CHANCE TO TURN THE PAGE . NOW IS OUR CHANCE TO WRITE A NEW CHAPTER . I AM IN THIS RACE BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO SEE US SPEND THE NEXT YEAR RE-FIGHTING THE WASHINGTON BATTLES OF THE 1990S . I DON'T WANT TO PIT BLUE AMERICA AGAINST RED AMERICA , I WANT TO LEAD A UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . I DON'T WANT THIS ELECTION TO BE ABOUT THE PAST , BECAUSE IF IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE , WE ALL WIN . IF THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO END THIS WAR , OR PASS UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE , OR MAKE MORE COLLEGE AFFORDABLE , IT WON'T JUST BE A DEMOCRATIC VICTORY ; IT WILL BE AN AMERICAN VICTORY . THAT'S THE VICTORY THIS COUNTRY NEEDS RIGHT NOW . THIS ELECTION AND THIS MOMENT ARE TOO IMPORTANT TO SETTLE FOR WHAT WE ALREADY KNOW . THE TIME HAS COME TO REACH FOR WHAT WE KNOW IS POSSIBLE . I AM NOT RUNNING FOR THIS OFFICE TO FULFILL ANY LONG-HELD PLANS OR BECAUSE I BELIEVE IT IS SOMEHOW OWED TO ME . I NEVER EXPECTED TO BE HERE , AND I ALWAYS KNEW THE JOURNEY WOULD BE IMPROBABLE . I'VE NEVER BEEN ON ONE THAT WASN'T . I AM RUNNING BECAUSE OF WHAT DR . KING CALLED "THE FIERCE URGENCY OF NOW ." I AM RUNNING BECAUSE I DO BELIEVE THERE'S SUCH A THING AS BEING TOO LATE . AND THAT HOUR IS ALMOST HERE . I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I DON'T WANT TO WAKE UP ONE MORNING FOUR YEARS FROM NOW , AND TURN ON ONE OF THOSE CABLE TALK SHOWS , AND SEE THAT WASHINGTON IS STILL STUCK IN THE SAME FOOD FIGHT IT'S BEEN IN FOR OVER A DECADE . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT MORE AMERICANS LOST THEIR HEALTH CARE AND FELL INTO BANKRUPTCY BECAUSE WE LET THE INSURANCE INDUSTRY SPEND MILLIONS TO STOP US FOR YET ANOTHER YEAR . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT THE OCEANS ROSE ANOTHER FEW INCHES AND THE PLANET HAS REACHED THE POINT OF NO RETURN BECAUSE WE COULDN'T FIND A WAY TO STOP OURSELVES FROM BUYING OIL FROM DICTATORS . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT WE RISKED MORE AMERICAN LIVES IN ANOTHER MISGUIDED WAR BECAUSE NO ONE HAD THE JUDGMENT TO ASK THE TOUGH QUESTIONS BEFORE WE SENT OUR TROOPS TO FIGHT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE THAT . I DON'T WANT TO SEE HOMELESS VETERANS ON THE STREET . I DON'T WANT TO SEND ANOTHER GENERATION OF CHILDREN THROUGH CORRIDORS OF SHAME . I DON'T WANT THIS FUTURE FOR MY DAUGHTERS AND I DO NOT ACCEPT THIS FUTURE FOR AMERICA . IT IS TIME TO TURN THE PAGE . I RUN FOR THE PRESIDENCY FOR THE SAME REASON I DROVE HALFWAY ACROSS THE COUNTRY OVER TWO DECADES AGO TO BRING JOBS TO THE JOBLESS AND HOPE TO THE HOPELESS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO ; FOR THE SAME REASON I STOOD UP FOR JUSTICE AND EQUALITY AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER ; FOR THE SAME REASON I'VE FOUGHT FOR ILLINOIS FAMILIES FOR OVER A DECADE . BECAUSE I WILL NEVER FORGET THAT THE ONLY REASON I AM STANDING HERE TODAY IS BECAUSE SOMEONE , SOMEWHERE STOOD UP WHEN IT WASN'T POPULAR , WHEN IT WAS RISKY ; WHEN IT WAS HARD . AND BECAUSE THAT SOMEONE STOOD UP , A FEW MORE DID . AND THEN A FEW THOUSAND . AND THEN A FEW MILLION . AND TOGETHER , THEY CHANGED THE WORLD . THAT'S WHY I RUN IN THIS ELECTION . I RUN TO GIVE MY CHILDREN AND THEIR CHILDREN THE SAME CHANCES THAT SOMEONE , SOMEWHERE GAVE ME . I RUN SO THAT A YEAR FROM TODAY , THERE IS A CHANCE THAT THE WORLD WILL LOOK AT AMERICA DIFFERENTLY , AND THAT AMERICA WILL LOOK AT ITSELF DIFFERENTLY . AND I RUN TO KEEP THE PROMISE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA ALIVE FOR ALL THOSE WHO STILL HUNGER FOR OPPORTUNITY AND THIRST FOR EQUALITY AND LONG TO BELIEVE AGAIN . THAT IS THE CHANGE THAT'S POSSIBLE IN THIS ELECTION . THAT IS THE MOMENT I WANT TO SEIZE AS PRESIDENT . AND I ASK YOU ALL TO JOIN ME IN THIS JOURNEY . THANK YOU .
BLUE	IT'S A SPECIAL HONOR TO BE HERE IN CLARENDON COUNTY . BECAUSE CLARENDON COUNTY IS THE PLACE THAT SHOWED ME AND SHOWED AMERICA THAT WHEN ORDINARY PEOPLE COME TOGETHER , THEY CAN DO EXTRAORDINARY THINGS . THAT'S THE CLARENDON COUNTY I KNOW . I KNOW HOW SIXTY YEARS AGO , THE NAACP'S JAMES HINTON DARED TO ASK WHY WHITE CHILDREN COULD RIDE BUSES TO SCHOOL BUT BLACK CHILDREN HAD TO WALK . I KNOW HOW REVEREND J.A . UNKNOWNWORD , A PREACHER AND TEACHER IN SUMMERTON , HEARD THAT CALL AND JOINED WITH LEVI PEARSON , A FATHER WHO WAS SICK AND TIRED OF SEEING HIS CHILDREN WALK NINE MILES TO SCHOOL , AND WITH HARRY AND ELIZA BRIGGS AND MORE THAN A DOZEN OTHER BLACK PARENTS TO CHALLENGE UNEQUAL EDUCATION . I KNOW THAT BECAUSE OF THAT CHALLENGE , HARRY BRIGGS LOST HIS JOB AT THE LOCAL SERVICE STATION , ELIZA BRIGGS LOST HERS AT A LOCAL HOTEL , AND REVEREND DELAINE'S HOME WAS BURNED TO THE GROUND WHILE THE FIRE DEPARTMENT STOOD BY AND WATCHED . IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR THEM TO STAY HOME . TO HEED THE VOICES OF CAUTION AND CONVENIENCE THAT SAID , "WAIT ," "THE TIMING ISN'T RIGHT ," OR "THE COUNTRY JUST ISN'T READY ." IT WOULD HAVE BEEN EASY FOR THEM TO GIVE IN TO THE FEARS THAT NO DOUBT KEPT THEM AWAKE SOME NIGHTS . BUT I KNOW THAT BECAUSE THEY WERE WILLING TO OVERCOME THEIR FEARS AND REACH FOR A LARGER DREAM , THE SUPREME COURT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BUT EQUAL ," AND CONGRESS PASSED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT AND THE VOTING RIGHTS ACT . AND I KNOW THAT I STAND ON THEIR SHOULDERS , THAT THEIR COURAGE AND SACRIFICE SIX DECADES AGO MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR ME TO RUN TODAY FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . SO I KNOW CLARENDON COUNTY . THE CLARENDON COUNTY THAT SHOWED A NATION HOW TO LOOK UP RATHER THAN DOWN . THE CLARENDON COUNTY THAT MADE A CLAIM ON THE AMERICAN DREAM . THE CLARENDON COUNTY THAT CHANGED THE COURSE OF HISTORY . BUT I ALSO KNOW ANOTHER CLARENDON COUNTY . I KNOW SCHOOLS IN THE CORRIDOR OF SHAME . I KNOW J.V . MARTIN JUNIOR HIGH SCHOOL IN DILLON WAS BUILT MORE THAN A CENTURY AGO , AND FOR YEARS HAD SHATTERED WINDOWS , LEAKING CEILINGS , AND BROKEN BATHROOMS . I KNOW SOUTH CAROLINA HAS THE WORST HIGH SCHOOL DROPOUT RATE IN AMERICA . I KNOW THAT ALL ACROSS THIS NATION , ONE OUT OF EVERY FOUR CHILDREN GO TO SCHOOLS JUST LIKE J . V . MARTIN , AND TAKE AWAY THE SAME MESSAGE THAT WE DON'T CARE ENOUGH ABOUT THEIR EDUCATION TO DO BETTER BY THEM . I KNOW THAT AMERICA TODAY IS STILL BLIND TO THE POVERTY IN OUR MIDST , AND THAT WE STILL TOLERATE JENA JUSTICE FOR SOME AND SCOOTER LIBBY JUSTICE FOR OTHERS . I KNOW THAT BLACK PARENTS IN CLARENDON ARE STILL HAVING TO GO TO COURT TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN AN EQUAL EDUCATION - FIFTY YEARS AFTER BROWN V . BOARD OF EDUCATION . THERE IS ANOTHER SIDE OF CLARENDON COUNTY , ANOTHER SIDE OF AMERICA , STILL WAITING FOR WHAT HARRY AND ELIZA BRIGGS UNKNOWNWORD FOR . THE HOPE THAT OUR CHILDREN'S DESTINIES AREN'T WRITTEN BEFORE THEY ARE BORN . THE HOPE THAT ONE DAY THE WORLD AS IT IS AND THE WORLD AS IT SHOULD BE MIGHT BE ONE AND THE SAME . THAT IS WHY I STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . I AM RUNNING BECAUSE I REFUSE TO ACCEPT THAT THE WAY IT IS , IS THE WAY IT HAS TO BE . I REFUSE TO ACCEPT IT WHEN I HEAR ADULTS SAY THINGS LIKE "THESE KIDS CAN'T LEARN " OR "THESE KIDS COME FROM TOUGH BACKGROUNDS " OR "THESE KIDS ARE TOO FAR BEHIND ." WE NEED TO START TREATING "THESE KIDS " LIKE "OUR KIDS ." I AM RUNNING BECAUSE I WANT A SENSE OF URGENCY ABOUT OUR KIDS IN WASHINGTON . WHEN I'M IN THE WHITE HOUSE , WE'LL REFORM NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND SO WE DON'T LEAVE THE MONEY BEHIND . WE'LL RECRUIT AN ARMY OF NEW TEACHERS - AND MAKE SURE THEY COME TEACH HERE IN MANNING - BECAUSE THE MOST IMPORTANT FACTOR IN A CHILD'S EDUCATION IS THE PERSON STANDING AT THE HEAD OF THE CLASSROOM . WE'LL INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION BECAUSE FOR EVERY DOLLAR WE PUT THERE , WE GET SEVEN DOLLARS BACK IN REDUCED DROPOUT RATES , REDUCED DELINQUENCY , AND REDUCED PRISON RATES , AND MORE YOUNG PEOPLE CAN GO TO COLLEGE AND GET GOOD JOBS . AND WE'LL REBUILD OUR BROKEN SCHOOLS . WE KNOW WHY THIS MATTERS . IT'S NOT JUST THAT A GOOD EDUCATION IS ESSENTIAL TO HELPING THE CHILDREN OF TODAY COMPETE MORE EFFECTIVELY AS THE WORKERS OF TOMORROW . IT'S THAT THE PROMISE OF A GOOD EDUCATION MAKES IT POSSIBLE FOR EVERY CHILD TO TRANSCEND THE BARRIERS OF RACE AND CLASS AND BACKGROUND AND ACHIEVE THEIR GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . THAT'S WHY HARRY AND ELIZA BRIGGS PUT THEIR NAMES ON THAT LAWSUIT . THAT'S WHY SO MANY OTHERS RISKED SO MUCH TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN AN EQUAL EDUCATION . THAT'S MY STORY . THAT'S WHAT THE AMERICAN STORY IS SUPPOSED TO BE ABOUT . THAT CAUSE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR . A QUALITY EDUCATION IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR . UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR . ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITY IS WORTH FIGHTING FOR . EQUALITY IS STILL WORTH FIGHTING FOR . AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT HELPS US WIN THESE FIGHTS . NOT BECAUSE IT'S UP TO ME ALONE . NOT BECAUSE I HAVE A CORNER ON ALL THE BEST IDEAS . BUT BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT WE NEED MORE THAN A NEW CAMPAIGN OR CANDIDATE - WE NEED A MOVEMENT . WE NEED A PRESIDENT READY TO PARTNER WITH YOU AND NOT TOO IMPORTANT TO DO SO , READY TO MOVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO COMMON CAUSE ON THESE ISSUES , AND WILLING TO ASK YOU TO DO YOUR PART - NOT JUST AS VOTERS , BUT AS CITIZENS . BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS , NO MATTER HOW MANY GOVERNMENT PROGRAMS WE LAUNCH OR HOW MANY TAX DOLLARS WE SPEND , WE CAN STILL FALL SHORT IF EACH OF US IS UNWILLING TO DO OUR OWN PART . IF WE'RE UNWILLING TO BE RESPONSIBLE PARENTS AND TURN OFF THE TV , PUT AWAY THE VIDEO GAMES , READ TO OUR CHILD , AND ATTEND THOSE PARENT/TEACHER CONFERENCES . WE CAN STILL FALL SHORT IF WE DON'T HEAL THE HOLE IN THE HEARTS OF ALL THOSE YOUNG MEN STANDING ON STREET CORNERS IN EVERY CITY IN THIS COUNTRY WITHOUT A SENSE OF ANY DESTINY OTHER THAN ENDING UP IN JAIL OR DEAD . AND HEALING THAT HOLE IS GOING TO TAKE MORE THAN A CHANGE IN POLICY ; IT'S GOING TO TAKE A CHANGE OF HEART . WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO RECLAIM IN OUR OWN LIVES THE BELIEF THAT I AM MY BROTHER'S KEEPER ; I AM MY SISTER'S KEEPER . IT'S THE BELIEF THAT LED FOLKS IN CLARENDON NOT TO TURN THEIR BACKS ON HARRY BRIGGS AND HIS FELLOW FOOT SOLDIERS , BUT TO OFFER THEM MONEY WHEN THEIR CREDIT WAS CUT AT THE LOCAL STORE , AND A PLACE TO STAY WHEN THEY WERE KICKED OFF THE LAND . IT'S THE BELIEF THAT LED A WHITE JUDGE NAMED J . WAITES WARING TO STAND BY THEIR SIDE EVEN AFTER A CROSS WAS BURNED ON HIS UNKNOWNWORD AND SHOTS WERE FIRED INTO HIS LIVING ROOM . AND IT'S THE BELIEF THAT LED ME INTO PUBLIC SERVICE MORE THAN TWO DECADES AGO . AS SOME OF YOU MAY KNOW , AFTER COLLEGE , I WALKED AWAY FROM A CAREER ON WALL STREET , AND WENT TO WORK WITH A GROUP OF CHURCHES AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO SO I COULD FIGHT FOR FOLKS WHO HAD LOST THEIR JOBS WHEN THE LOCAL STEEL PLANT CLOSED . AND EVER SINCE , I'VE BEEN FIGHTING TO PUT THE AMERICAN DREAM WITHIN REACH FOR EVERY AMERICAN . THAT'S WHY I WENT TO WORK AS A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER , AND AS A STATE SENATOR AND AS A U.S . SENATOR . THAT'S WHY I EXPANDED HEALTH CARE TO 150,000 CHILDREN AND THEIR PARENTS IN ILLINOIS . THAT'S WHY I LED THE FIGHT TO REFORM A DEATH PENALTY SYSTEM THAT HAD SENTENCED 13 INNOCENT MEN TO DEATH . THAT'S WHY I LED THE FIGHT TO REFORM RACIAL PROFILING . AND THAT'S WHY YOU CAN TRUST THAT I'LL FIGHT FOR YOU AS PRESIDENT . NOW , I'VE HEARD THAT SOME FOLKS AREN'T SURE AMERICA IS READY FOR AN AFRICAN-AMERICAN PRESIDENT , SO LET ME BE CLEAR : I NEVER WOULD HAVE BEGUN THIS CAMPAIGN IF I WEREN'T CONFIDENT I COULD WIN . BUT YOU SEE , I AM NOT ASKING ANYONE TO TAKE A CHANCE ON ME . I AM ASKING YOU TO TAKE A CHANCE ON YOUR OWN ASPIRATIONS . JUST IMAGINE WHAT WE COULD DO AS UNKNOWNWORD IN AN OBAMA ADMINISTRATION . IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHO WAS RAISED LIKE I WAS BY A SINGLE MOM WHO HAD TO WORK AND GO TO SCHOOL AND RAISE HER KIDS AND ACCEPT FOOD STAMPS FOR A WHILE . IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHO COULD GO INTO HOLLY COURTS APARTMENTS HERE IN MANNING OR SCOTT'S BRANCH HIGH SCHOOL IN SUMMERTON , AND GIVE THE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN THERE SOMEONE TO LOOK UP TO . IMAGINE A PRESIDENT WHO FOUGHT EACH DAY TO NARROW THE GAP BETWEEN THE WORLD AS IT IS AND THE WORLD AS IT SHOULD BE . UNKNOWNWORD THAT GAP IS NOT GOING TO BE EASY . BUT REAL CHANGE NEVER IS . I CAN STILL REMEMBER ONE OF THE EARLY DAYS WHEN I WAS JUST STARTING OUT AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER IN CHICAGO . WE HAD SET UP A MEETING TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO REBUILD OUR NEIGHBORHOODS , BUT NO ONE SHOWED UP . AND OUR VOLUNTEERS FELT SO DEFEATED , THEY WANTED TO QUIT . AND I WAS TIRED TOO . BUT AT THAT MOMENT , I LOOKED OUTSIDE AND SAW SOME YOUNG BOYS PLAYING IN A VACANT LOT ACROSS THE STREET , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT A UNKNOWNWORD APARTMENT BUILDING . AND I TURNED TO THE VOLUNTEERS , AND I ASKED THEM , "BEFORE YOU QUIT , I WANT YOU TO ANSWER ONE QUESTION . WHAT'S GONNA HAPPEN TO THOSE BOYS ?" I THOUGHT , IF WE CANNOT PUT ASIDE OUR DOUBTS AND OUR CYNICISM ; IF WE CANNOT SEE THAT WE HAVE A STAKE IN THOSE CHILDREN ; IF WE DON'T REALIZE THAT THE FIGHT FOR THEIR FUTURE IS THE FIGHT FOR OUR OWN , WHO WILL ? ONE BY ONE , THE VOLUNTEERS DECIDED TO STAY . AND BLOCK BY BLOCK , WE BEGAN TO TURN THOSE NEIGHBORHOODS AROUND . SO TODAY , SIXTY YEARS AFTER JAMES HINTON ISSUED HIS CHALLENGE , I WANT TO ISSUE A CHALLENGE OF MY OWN . IF YOU'RE TIRED OF THE POLITICS OF FEAR AND DIVISION ; IF YOU'RE TIRED OF A GOVERNMENT THAT STANDS IDLY BY WHILE OUR SCHOOLS GO UNKNOWNWORD , OUR CHILDREN GO UNKNOWNWORD , AND OUR COMMUNITIES ARE NEGLECTED ; IF YOU FEEL AS I DO THAT IF WE DON'T FIGHT FOR THAT NEXT GENERATION OF CHILDREN , WHO WILL ? - THEN I'M ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME . AND IF YOU CAN DO THAT - IF YOU CAN OVERCOME YOUR DOUBTS , UNKNOWNWORD AWAY YOUR FEARS , AND BELIEVE ONCE AGAIN THAT REAL CHANGE IS POSSIBLE IN THIS COUNTRY - THEN I TRULY BELIEVE WE CAN BRING ABOUT THE WORLD THAT HARRY AND ELIZA BRIGGS DREAMED OF FOR THEIR CHILDREN .
