BLUE	WELL I AM SO HONORED AND PERSONALLY UNKNOWNWORD TO BE HERE , AND I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR BRINGING US TOGETHER THIS WEEK AROUND WORLD UNKNOWNWORD DAY . AND I WANT TO THANK THEIR TREMENDOUS STAFF AND THE VOLUNTEERS AND EVERYONE WHO HELPED MAKE THIS HAPPEN . I'M GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY TO SHARE OUR COMMITMENT ABOUT DEALING WITH THE GLOBAL SCOURGE OF UNKNOWNWORD . I ALSO WANT TO RECOGNIZE TWO FIRST UNKNOWNWORD : THE FIRST LADY OF UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FIRST LADY OF UNKNOWNWORD . I AM UNKNOWNWORD THAT THEY ARE HERE UNKNOWNWORD THEIR COUNTRIES AND THEIR PEOPLE . AND FIRST , [APPLAUSE ] LET ME FIRST SAY HOW UNKNOWNWORD BILL AND I WERE TO HEAR THAT UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE RECENT UNKNOWNWORD - AND HOW IMPRESSED AND MOVED WE WERE TO HEAR ABOUT THE LOVE AND SUPPORT THAT YOU GAVE THOSE WHO WERE NOT SO FORTUNATE . IT'S ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF THE WAY IN WHICH THIS CHURCH IS NOT UNKNOWNWORD BY NUMBERS . YES , THE NUMBERS ARE BIG , THEY'RE CERTAINLY UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IT'S UNKNOWNWORD BY YOUR IMPACT . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD BY THE MEANING THAT YOU GIVE TO LIVES HERE WITHIN THIS COMPLEX AND SO FAR BEYOND ITS BOUNDARIES . AND THE COMMITMENT THAT YOU DEMONSTRATE BOTH TO OUR FAITH IN GOD AND TO DOING HIS WORK HERE ON EARTH IS EXEMPLARY AND THAT IS ONE OF THE MANY REASONS THAT I WANTED TO BE HERE TODAY . YOU KNOW , UNKNOWNWORD HAS HELPED SO MANY PEOPLE WITH HIS LESSONS FOR A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JOURNEY . BUT HE KNOWS THOSE 40 DAYS ARE JUST THE BEGINNING . MY OWN FAITH JOURNEY IS APPROACHING A HALF A CENTURY , AND I KNOW HOW FAR I STILL HAVE TO GO . BUT I HAVE BEEN BLESSED IN MY LIFE , BOTH STARTING IN MY FAMILY AND IN THE CHURCH OF MY CHILDHOOD , TO BE UNKNOWNWORD EVERY STEP OF THE WAY . A MOTHER , WHO TAUGHT UNKNOWNWORD SCHOOL AND MADE SURE THAT MY BROTHERS AND I WERE THERE THE MINUTE THE CHURCH DOORS UNKNOWNWORD . A FATHER , WHO UNKNOWNWORD BY THE SIDE OF HIS BED EVERY NIGHT OF HIS LIFE TO SAY HIS PRAYERS . A MINISTER OF OUR YOUTH UNKNOWNWORD , WHO TOOK IT AS PART OF HIS MISSION TO SHOW THE GROUP OF WHITE , SUBURBAN , MIDDLE CLASS KIDS THAT THERE WAS A BIGGER WORLD OUTSIDE . AND A PRAYER GROUP THAT FORMED FOR ME UNKNOWNWORD AFTER I CAME TO THE WHITE HOUSE - A GROUP OF EXTRAORDINARY WOMEN , BOTH DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS , WHOSE LOVE AND SUPPORT UNKNOWNWORD ME . I'VE OFTEN BEEN ASKED IF I'M A PRAYING PERSON AND I HAVE ALWAYS RESPONDED THAT I WAS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO BE RAISED TO UNDERSTAND THAT THE POWER AND PURPOSE OF PRAYER , BUT , HAD I NOT BEEN , PROBABLY ONE WEEK IN THE WHITE HOUSE WOULD HAVE TURNED ME INTO ONE . UNKNOWNWORD ] IT'S WONDERFUL TO KNOW THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD POWER OF PRAYER IS THERE FOR SO MANY OF US . ONE OF MY FAVORITE UNKNOWNWORD IN SCRIPTURE IS THAT FAMOUS LINE IN JAMES THAT FAITH WITHOUT WORKS IS DEAD . BUT I HAVE CONCLUDED THAT WORKS WITHOUT FAITH IS JUST TOO HARD . IT CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD OVER ONE'S LIFE OR OVER THE GENERATIONS . AND IT'S IMPORTANT FOR US TO RECOGNIZE HOW HERE , IN WHAT YOU'RE DOING , FAITH AND WORK COME TOGETHER . YOU UNDERSTAND THAT . OR AS UNKNOWNWORD MIGHT SAY : CREED AND DEED ! AND WHAT EXTRAORDINARY IMPORTANT WORK YOUR FAITH SUPPORTS - FIGHTING AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CORRUPT LEADERSHIP , POVERTY , UNKNOWNWORD , AND DISEASES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD . TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO , WHEN MEN - MOSTLY YOUNG GAY MEN - BEGAN UNKNOWNWORD FROM A DISEASE THAT HAD NO NAME , WE COULD NOT HAVE , AND CERTAINLY DID NOT , TALK ABOUT IT IN CHURCH . IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN PROPER . IT WOULD NOT HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD . IT WOULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD FOR SO MANY OF US . BUT THE DISEASE ITSELF WAS NOT UNKNOWNWORD , AND IGNORING IT DID NOT MAKE IT GO AWAY . IT ONLY MADE THE PROBLEM WORSE , BECAUSE THE DISEASE UNKNOWNWORD ON IGNORANCE AND FEAR AND , LET'S BE HONEST , ON UNKNOWNWORD . WE ARE TAUGHT TO HEAL THE SICK . TO LOVE THEM AS OUR OWN . BUT TWENTY-FIVE YEARS AGO , TOO MANY DIED ALONE , ASHAMED TO TELL THEIR FAMILIES WHAT HAD MADE THEM ILL . IN THE UNKNOWNWORD , WE LEARN THAT ONE-THIRD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS HEALING THE SICK . AND IF YOU READ THOSE MOMENTS , WHEN JESUS IS PRESENTED WITH SOMEONE WHO IS ILL , IT BECOMES UNKNOWNWORD CLEAR THAT CHRIST HAD A CHOICE . HE COULD HAVE BEEN TOO BUSY . HE COULD HAVE THOUGHT YOU KNOW THIS IS NOT THE MESSAGE OF THE DAY . I DON'T NEED TO DO THIS ; I'VE ALREADY DONE IT IN UNKNOWNWORD SO I DON'T NEED TO DO IT AGAIN . BUT HE MADE THE CHOICE . HE NEVER ASKED WHY SOMEONE WAS SICK . HE JUST HEALED AND UNKNOWNWORD THOSE IN NEED . THAT IS WHAT UNKNOWNWORD HAS CHOSEN TOO . OTHER CHURCHES , UNKNOWNWORD , AND GOVERNMENTS HAVE ALSO CHOSEN TO HEAL , TO HELP , TO REDEEM . FOR MANY OF US THE GOLDEN RULE CALLS ON US TO ACT . AND SO WE'VE COME A LONG WAY . NOT ONLY CAN WE TALK ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD IN CHURCH , BUT CHURCHES ARE LEADING THE WAY . THANKS TO LEADERS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , CHRISTIANS HAVE EMBRACED THE UNKNOWNWORD AMONG US , AND HAVE FOUGHT THE DISEASE ITSELF . WE'VE HAD BREAKTHROUGHS IN TREATMENT THAT ALLOW THOSE WITH THIS DISEASE TO LIVE MUCH LONGER , AND WE ARE HOPING FOR BREAKTHROUGHS IN UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . BUT LET US NOT GROW COMPLACENT OR TOO COMFORTABLE . LET US NOT FEEL THAT BECAUSE WE'RE HERE AT THIS CONFERENCE OR AS A MEMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD OR SOME OTHER CHURCH UNKNOWNWORD TODAY THAT WE ARE DOING OUR PART , BECAUSE WE HAVE SUCH A LONG WAY TO GO . HERE IN AMERICA , WE STILL HAVE AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RATES ARE RISING AMONG GAY MEN AGAIN AND AMONG AFRICAN AMERICANS AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE DISEASE TAKES A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE POOR AND COMMUNITIES OF COLOR . AND IT IS AN OUTRAGE THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS THE LEADING CAUSE OF DEATH FOR BLACK WOMEN BETWEEN THE AGES OF 25 AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AROUND THE WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD REMAINS A PLAGUE OF UNKNOWNWORD PROPORTIONS . IN TOO MANY PLACES , IGNORANCE ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE STIGMA REMAINS STRONG . AND WHERE IGNORANCE AND UNKNOWNWORD LIVE , THE DISEASE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I WALKED THROUGH THE WORLD VISION VILLAGE , I WAS TOLD THE STORY OF UNKNOWNWORD - A YOUNG UNKNOWNWORD BOY WHO LOST FIRST HIS FATHER AND HIS MOTHER TO WHAT IS CALLED THE UNKNOWNWORD DISEASE ." AND FOR YEARS HIS GRANDMOTHER HAD TOLD HIM HE DID NOT HAVE IT . BUT AFTER THE DEATH OF HIS MOTHER , HE BEGAN TO UNKNOWNWORD , FINALLY WAS TESTED AND FOUND OUT HE WAS POSITIVE . EVEN BEFORE THE POSITIVE RESULTS CAME IN , THE BOYS HE PLAYED UNKNOWNWORD WITH BEGAN TO UNKNOWNWORD HIM . IT BECAME INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD TO GO TO SCHOOL . SO THE STIGMA IS ONE OF THE REAL EVILS THAT HAS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD IF WE ARE TO TAKE ON UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD . WE SHOULD TAKE HEART THAT THE UNITED NATIONS RECENTLY UNKNOWNWORD ITS ESTIMATE OF THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE INFECTED WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM 40 MILLION TO UNKNOWNWORD MILLION . BUT PLEASE DON'T TAKE ANY UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE STILL UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE INFECTED AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO DIE FROM UNKNOWNWORD EVERY DAY . UNKNOWNWORD IS STILL THE NUMBER ONE CAUSE OF DEATH IN AFRICA , WHERE 90 PERCENT OF THE UNKNOWNWORD POSITIVE CHILDREN IN THE WORLD LIVE . DON'T LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT THE TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD HAS PASSED . WE CAN'T SLOW . WE CAN'T REST . AND WE CAN'T QUIT . I'VE SEEN THE TRAGEDY OF UNKNOWNWORD FIRSTHAND . FROM A DEAR FRIEND , WHO TOLD ME IN THE EARLY 1980S - MUCH I MUST UNKNOWNWORD TO MY SURPRISE IN THOSE DAYS - THAT HE WAS GAY . HE HAD THE UNKNOWNWORD DISEASE , AND HE DIED UNKNOWNWORD AFTER . TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GIRL THAT I MET IN NORTHERN UNKNOWNWORD AT A UNKNOWNWORD FOR FORMER UNKNOWNWORD . SHE HAD BEEN SOLD INTO UNKNOWNWORD AT THE AGE OF EIGHT BY HER FAMILY FOR A UNKNOWNWORD TELEVISION . SHE WAS PUT TO WORK IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . SHE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS TURNED OUT AND RETURNED HOME TO A FAMILY THAT WOULD NOT TAKE HER IN . SHE DID FIND REFUGE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I MET HER SHE WAS IN A WHEELCHAIR , SO WEAK SHE DIDN'T HAVE THE STRENGTH TO TALK . AS I KNELT DOWN UNKNOWNWORD HER , I COULD SEE THE SKIN STRETCHED UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS HER UNKNOWNWORD . I THOUGHT OF MY OWN DAUGHTER AND OF ALL THE GIRLS HER AGE WHO SPEAK WITH SUCH EXCITEMENT ABOUT THEIR FUTURES , AND ABOUT HOW CRUEL AN INJUSTICE IT WAS THAT THIS CHILD WOULD NEVER KNOW HERS . A WEEK AFTER I RETURNED TO AMERICA , PEOPLE RUNNING THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ME TO TELL ME SHE HAD DIED . TO THIS DAY , I THINK OF THAT UNKNOWNWORD FACE AND THOSE WARM EYES AND WHAT MIGHT HAVE BEEN DONE TO SPARE HER THE FATE SHE MET . SHE MAY HAVE DIED ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE WORLD , BUT UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT JUST AN AFRICAN PROBLEM , IT'S NOT JUST AN ASIAN PROBLEM , AND IT'S NOT JUST AN AMERICAN PROBLEM . AND IT'S CERTAINLY NOT SOMEONE ELSE'S PROBLEM . IT'S A PROBLEM OF OUR COMMON HUMANITY , AND WE ARE CALLED TO RESPOND , WITH LOVE , WITH MERCY , AND WITH URGENCY . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL WAGE THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT IT DEMANDS . I WILL ASK FOR $50 BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD , [APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL ASK FOR MORE MONEY TO TACKLE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD AS WELL . I WILL BUILD ON THE FUNDING LEVELS IN UNKNOWNWORD AND ON THE LEADERSHIP THAT THE PRESIDENT AND MRS . BUSH HAVE SHOWN , TO DEMONSTRATE THAT THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD IS AN AMERICAN COMMITMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE SEEK BIPARTISAN SOLUTIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS . IF WE START ACTING NOT AS REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS BUT AS AMERICANS AGAIN . THIS IS ALSO A GREAT OPPORTUNITY FOR PARTNERSHIP . THERE ARE MANY CHURCHES AND FAITH BASED GROUPS HERE IN OUR COUNTRY AND INCREASINGLY IN OTHER PARTS OF THE WORLD WHO ARE UNDERSTANDING THE URGENCY OF THIS MISSION . THERE ARE MANY FOUNDATIONS AND NOT FOR PROFIT ORGANIZATIONS LIKE THE GATES FOUNDATION OR MY HUSBAND'S WORK FOR THE CLINTON FOUNDATION . THEY ARE UNKNOWNWORD WHAT WE ARE DOING THROUGH THE GOVERNMENT , AND THEY ARE DOING WHAT THE GOVERNMENT CANNOT DO . AND IT IS THAT PARTNERSHIP THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN . WHEN I WAS PRIVILEGED TO REPRESENT OUR COUNTRY AROUND THE WORLD , TRAVELING TO MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES , I WAS OFTEN STRUCK BY HOW SO MUCH OF THE REST OF THE WORLD DID NOT UNDERSTAND THE VOLUNTARY SECTOR IN AMERICA . AS UNKNOWNWORD WAS SAYING , THE PRIVATE , THE PUBLIC , THE UNKNOWNWORD - THERE WAS NO SENSE THAT INDIVIDUALS WOULD VOLUNTEER THEIR TIME , GIVE UP THEIR MONEY TO HELP MEET A COMMON NEED . BUT WE ARE SETTING FORTH THAT EXAMPLE , AS WELL , IN THE WORK THAT IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD . BY DOING THIS , WHICH IS THE RIGHT THING TO DO , WE ARE ALSO HELPING TO IMPROVE AMERICA'S STANDING IN THE WORLD . WE ARE PUTTING A DIFFERENT FACE ON OUR COUNTRY ; WE ARE REACHING OUT IN A COMMON SEARCH FOR ANSWERS . AND WE WILL BE ABLE NOT ONLY TO BUILD ON THAT WORK , TO SAVE LIVES , TO PREVENT THE SPREAD OF THIS DISEASE , BUT ALSO TO CREATE A BROADER PLATFORM FOR THE VALUES AND IDEALS THAT WE HOLD DEAR . IN ORDER TO ACCOMPLISH MY GOALS AS PRESIDENT I HAVE LAID OUT A VERY COMPREHENSIVE UNKNOWNWORD AGENDA . FIRST , MY ADMINISTRATION WILL INVEST IN TREATMENTS AND CAPACITY BUILDING BY IMPROVING HEALTH SYSTEMS ACROSS AFRICA AND DOUBLING THE NUMBER OF PEOPLE RECEIVING UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENT WITH UNKNOWNWORD . FUNDING IN FIVE YEARS . EVERYONE WHO IS UNKNOWNWORD POSITIVE MUST HAVE ACCESS TO THESE DRUGS . I WANT PARTICULARLY TO TARGET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE KNOW HOW TO STOP THE SPREAD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM MOTHER TO CHILD BUT WE DON'T HAVE THE RESOURCES AND THE SYSTEM BEHIND DELIVERING THE DRUGS THAT ARE NECESSARY . I BELIEVE WE SHOULD DO MUCH MORE TO ENCOURAGE VOLUNTARY TESTING , BUT IN ORDER TO DO THAT IT MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD BY COUNSELING AND THERE HAS TO BE A PUBLIC EDUCATION AND OUTREACH EFFORT TO UNKNOWNWORD AND DIMINISH THE STIGMA . SOME COUNTRIES ARE BEGINNING TO DO THIS AND WE SHOULD ENCOURAGE THEM . UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL INVEST UNKNOWNWORD IN PREVENTION , TEACHING YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN HOW TO BE RESPONSIBLE ; HOW BEST TO PROTECT THEMSELVES . I VISITED UNKNOWNWORD TEN YEARS AGO TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAM , AND IT PRODUCED RESULTS . ABSTINENCE , BE FAITHFUL , USE UNKNOWNWORD IF NECESSARY . AND THIS HAS TO BE A MESSAGE THAT WE DO MUCH MORE TO UNKNOWNWORD EFFECTIVELY THROUGHOUT AREAS THAT ARE PARTICULARLY UNKNOWNWORD . THIRD , I'LL CONTINUE TO INVEST IN RESEARCH TO DEVELOP AN EFFECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD AND EVENTUALLY A CURE . THERE WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD , AS WE HAVE RECENTLY SEEN , BUT THAT DOESN'T MEAN WE CAN AFFORD TO QUIT . AND FINALLY , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD THE BATTLE AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN AMERICA . BUT I KNOW THAT NEITHER MONEY NOR GOVERNMENT ALONE WILL SOLVE THIS PROBLEM . UNKNOWNWORD TELLS US THAT THE BODY IS MADE UP OF MANY PARTS , AND UNKNOWNWORD ALL ITS PARTS ARE MANY , THEY FORM ONE BODY ." WELL WE NEED , AS THOUGH WE WERE ONE BODY , TO USE EVERY RESOURCE AT OUR HANDS , OUR UNKNOWNWORD . BECAUSE AS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE ADVOCATED , THE FIGHT AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD MUST BE DONE UNKNOWNWORD , BUILDING UNKNOWNWORD WITH CHURCHES AROUND THE WORLD AND HERE AT HOME . BECAUSE IF WE FAIL TO ENGAGE CHURCHES IN COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD , WE WILL FAIL TO CONQUER UNKNOWNWORD . AS YOU HAVE SHOWN , THERE ARE SIX THINGS CHURCHES CAN DO : CARE FOR THOSE WHO ARE INFECTED AND THEIR FAMILIES . ENCOURAGE TESTING , EVEN BECOME TESTING CENTERS . UNLEASH VOLUNTEERS . REDUCE THE STIGMA BY SHOWING IT'S NOT A UNKNOWNWORD TO BE SICK . CHAMPION HEALTHY BEHAVIOR . AND BE TREATMENT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THOSE TAKING UNKNOWNWORD . I WOULD ADD THAT CHURCHES ALSO MUST UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD SIDE OF THIS CRISIS . BECAUSE UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT JUST A MEDICAL EMERGENCY . WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ALONE AFTER LOSING BOTH PARENTS TO UNKNOWNWORD ? WHO WILL HEAL THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT LEADS THOUSANDS OF GIRLS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD FOR A UNKNOWNWORD TELEVISION OR A FEW DOLLARS INTO UNKNOWNWORD AND MODERN-DAY SLAVERY EACH YEAR ? WHO WILL PROVIDE STABILITY AND HOPE IN COMMUNITIES DEVASTATED BY UNKNOWNWORD ? WHO WILL WELCOME THE DRUG UNKNOWNWORD USING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR THE GAY TEENAGER SEEKING SAFETY AND UNKNOWNWORD ? JUST AS IN MY OWN LIFE I NEED BOTH FAITH AND WORK TO BE WHOLE - HEALING THE WORLD WILL TAKE BOTH FAITH AND WORK AS WELL . WE ARE COMPELLED TO ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE IT'S THE RIGHT THING TO DO . BUT WE CAN ALSO ACKNOWLEDGE IT'S SMART , AS WELL . UNKNOWNWORD IS TURNING BACK THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE DEVELOPMENT THAT WE HAVE SEEN IN AFRICA AND ELSEWHERE . IT IS DESTABILIZING COUNTRIES AND UNDERMINING ECONOMIES . IN SOME PLACES , UNKNOWNWORD CAN BE EVEN MORE DESTRUCTIVE THAN WAR . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND DESPAIR , AND WE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF HOPE AND PROGRESS . AND NOTHING WILL HELP AMERICA MORE TO WIN HEARTS AND MINDS AROUND THE WORLD MORE THAN SHOWING AMERICA'S TRUE HEART ON PROBLEMS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . IN FACT , WE KNOW OUR VALUES ARE THE SOURCE OF OUR GREATEST STRENGTH . AS THE PEACE PLAN HAS RECOGNIZED SO UNKNOWNWORD , HOWEVER , WE CAN'T ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD IN ISOLATION . UNKNOWNWORD IS DEEPLY UNKNOWNWORD WITH SO MANY OTHER CRISES , AND IF WE ARE SERIOUS ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THIS DISEASE , WE HAVE TO ADDRESS THEM AS WELL . TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO END UNKNOWNWORD IN AFRICA . UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD THE HEALTH UNKNOWNWORD IN THE DEVELOPING WORLD , ACCOUNTING FOR 40 PERCENT OF HEALTH SPENDING IN MANY COUNTRIES - MONEY WE NEED TO FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IS A CHALLENGE TO OUR CONSCIENCE IN ITS OWN RIGHT . IT IS UNKNOWNWORD THAT MORE THAN A MILLION PEOPLE DIE EVERY YEAR FROM A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND NEARLY ALL OF THEM ARE CHILDREN . A CHILD IN AFRICA UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD EVERY 30 UNKNOWNWORD . WE MADE A DECISION TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN NORTH AMERICA AND IN EUROPE . AND WE CAN DO THE SAME IN AFRICA AND ASIA . SO I'LL SET A GOAL OF ENDING ALL UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD IN AFRICA BY THE END OF MY SECOND TERM . WE CAN DO THIS IF WE ARE COMMITTED TOGETHER . WE ALSO NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD CONFRONT UNKNOWNWORD - A DISEASE THAT TAKES THE LIVES OF SO MANY UNKNOWNWORD VICTIMS BEFORE THEY SHOULD GO . A DISEASE THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO BECOME UNKNOWNWORD . THAT UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US . IT MAY START IN AFRICA OR IN A PRISON IN RUSSIA OR IN SOME OTHER FAR AWAY PLACE , BUT IT UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US BECAUSE IN A WORLD WITHOUT BOUNDARIES , PEOPLE AND UNKNOWNWORD MOVE FREELY . TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE ALSO NEED TO EDUCATE ALL THE WORLD'S CHILDREN . EDUCATION NOT ONLY UNKNOWNWORD POVERTY AND IMPROVES HEALTH , IT'S A KEY FORM OF PREVENTION . IT IS WHAT YOU MIGHT CALL A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD " AGAINST THE SPREAD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BUT TODAY , UNKNOWNWORD MILLION YOUNG CHILDREN - MOST OF THEM GIRLS - WILL NOT SET FOOT IN A SCHOOL , AND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS WILL NOT GO BEYOND PRIMARY SCHOOL . IN FACT , THERE ARE MORE YOUNG CHILDREN OUT OF SCHOOL IN AFRICA , THAN THERE ARE CHILDREN IN SCHOOL IN AMERICA . EVERY DAY WE DON'T ACT , WE DENY MORE CHILDREN THE UNKNOWNWORD THEY DESERVE . WE DENY FUTURE MOTHERS THE ABILITY TO READ A STORY TO THEIR CHILDREN OR A WARNING ON A MEDICINE LABEL . WE DENY WHAT IS AT THE HEART OF HUMAN DIGNITY : THE POWER TO LEARN , TO DISCOVER , TO GROW , TO REACH ONE'S GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . SO AS PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK TO PASS AND THEN SIGN MY BIPARTISAN EDUCATION FOR ALL ACT TO HELP PROVIDE A QUALITY , BASIC EDUCATION FOR EVERY SINGLE CHILD AROUND THE WORLD . AND FINALLY , TO END UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO STAND UP FOR WOMEN'S RIGHTS . UNKNOWNWORD TAKES A PARTICULARLY HARSH UNKNOWNWORD ON WOMEN AND GIRLS - ABOUT 60 PERCENT OF PEOPLE LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD AFRICA ARE WOMEN . THEY ARE YOUNG GIRLS WHO ARE TAKEN IN MARRIAGE OR IN UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE WOMEN WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; WHO HAVE NO SAY IN THEIR OWN LIVES , WHO WORK FROM UNKNOWNWORD UP TO UNKNOWNWORD DOWN ; WHO NEVER BELIEVED THEY HAVE ANY WAY TO SPEAK UP OR BE HEARD . THEIR SOCIETIES AND THEIR COUNTRY DON'T RECOGNIZE THEIR RIGHTS TO HEALTH CARE OR EDUCATION . THEY DON'T PARTICIPATE IN THE ECONOMY IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAY , ALTHOUGH THEIR WORK KEEPS PEOPLE ALIVE AND THRIVING . I REMEMBER ONCE DRIVING THROUGH AFRICA ON A BUS WITH A GROUP OF DISTINGUISHED EXPERTS AND IN FIELD AFTER FIELD AND MARKETPLACE AFTER MARKETPLACE WE SAW WOMEN WORKING , WOMEN WORKING HARD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WATER , SELLING THEIR PRODUCTS IN THE VILLAGES . AND THE UNKNOWNWORD SAID , "WELL , IT'S TOO BAD THAT ALL OF THEIR WORK DOESN'T MATTER IN THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY ." AND I SAID , WELL , IF THEY STOPPED ALL OF THEIR WORK , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY WOULD COLLAPSE . AND IT IS TIME WE PAY TRIBUTE AND RESPECT TO THE HARD WORK OF SUCH WOMEN . AND IT IS LONG PAST TIME THAT WE DO EVERYTHING WE CAN TO STAND UP FOR THE PROPOSITION THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS . AS I SAW SO UNKNOWNWORD AT THAT UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD , GIRLS DENIED THEIR HUMAN RIGHTS ARE GIRLS AT RISK OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND EVEN IN OUR OWN COUNTRY TODAY , WOMEN ARE NOW THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , I WENT TO BEIJING ON BEHALF OF OUR COUNTRY FOR THE UNITED NATION'S FOURTH WORLD CONFERENCE ON WOMEN . I SAID WHAT MOST OF US BELIEVE HERE IN AMERICA , THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS ARE HUMAN RIGHTS , BUT IT WAS CONSIDERED A RADICAL STATEMENT . I REMEMBER BEING ON THE VOICE OF AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD AFTER I CAME BACK . IT WAS A CALL IN RADIO SHOW THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THROUGHOUT THE WORLD AND A UNKNOWNWORD FROM IRAN CALLED AND HE ASKED ME UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DID I MEAN BY SAYING THAT WOMEN'S RIGHTS WERE HUMAN RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD AND I SAID , I WANT YOU TO STOP FOR A MINUTE , MAYBE CLOSE YOUR EYES AND THINK ABOUT ALL THE RIGHTS YOU HAVE AS A MAN . THE RIGHT TO WORK , THE RIGHT TO PURSUE AN EDUCATION , THE RIGHT TO START A BUSINESS , THE RIGHT TO BE ACTIVE IN YOUR COUNTRY'S AFFAIRS . THOSE ARE THE RIGHTS I'M TALKING ABOUT . THE RIGHTS THAT ARE THE REAL CORE OF WHO WE ARE AS HUMAN BEINGS . IT'S IMPORTANT WE CONTINUE TO WORK TO EMPOWER WOMEN TO TAKE RESPONSIBILITY FOR THEMSELVES AND THEIR FUTURES WITH INITIATIVES ON EVERYTHING FROM UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH TO UNKNOWNWORD AND ENTREPRENEURSHIP . I'LL CONTINUE THE WORK I STARTED AS FIRST LADY AND NOW AS A SENATOR TO END THE BUYING AND SELLING OF GIRLS AND WOMEN INTO MODERN-DAY SLAVERY . NOW , I KNOW THIS WON'T BE EASY . BUT I ALSO KNOW THE POWER OF AMERICA AT OUR BEST , AND I KNOW THE POWER OF FAITH AND OF PEOPLE OF FAITH , WHEN WE HEED UNKNOWNWORD CALL TO LIFT UP OUR VOICES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD . THE FAITH COMMUNITY LIFTED UP ITS VOICE AGAINST SLAVERY AND HELPED LEAD AMERICA TO END THAT EVIL . THE FAITH COMMUNITY LIFTED ITS VOICE AGAINST DISCRIMINATION HERE IN AMERICA AND AGAINST APARTHEID IN SOUTH AFRICA AND HELPED END BOTH . THE FAITH COMMUNITY LIFTED ITS VOICE FOR DEBT RELIEF FOR THE WORLD'S POOREST COUNTRIES , AND GAVE MANY COUNTRIES A UNKNOWNWORD START IN THE UNKNOWNWORD YEAR . TODAY THE FAITH COMMUNITY IS SPEAKING OUT AGAINST GENOCIDE IN DARFUR . TAKING ON GLOBAL WARMING AND WE CAN SEE FROM THIS ROOM THE AWESOME POWER TO ADDRESS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . TOGETHER I BELIEVE , WE CAN WRITE THE NEXT CHAPTER IN THIS HISTORY . IT IS A PROUD AND UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY . THANK YOU , THANK YOU TO UNKNOWNWORD . THANKS TO ALL OF YOU FOR THE WORK YOU ARE DOING AND FOR LIVING YOUR FAITH IN SUCH A VISIBLE WAY . AND I APPRECIATE THE OPPORTUNITY TO ADD MY VOICE TO YOURS . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH AND GOD UNKNOWNWORD .
BLUE	I'M UNKNOWNWORD TO BE HERE . I APOLOGIZE FOR BEING A LITTLE LATE . APPARENTLY , THERE WAS MORE OF A UNKNOWNWORD THAN UNKNOWNWORD AND IT TOOK US A LOT LONGER AND I APOLOGIZE FOR THAT . AND I THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR BEING HERE AND BEING PART OF THIS EVENT TODAY . I WANT TO RECOGNIZE A FEW PEOPLE BECAUSE I'M SO PLEASED THAT WE COULD HAVE THIS EVENT HERE AT THE BOYS CLUB . AND THAT WOULDN'T HAVE BEEN POSSIBLE WITHOUT ROGER UNKNOWNWORD AND THE BOYS CLUB OF SIOUX CITY FOR UNKNOWNWORD US TODAY . AND I WANT TO THANK MY GOOD FRIEND TOM UNKNOWNWORD , FORMER GOVERNOR UNKNOWNWORD , WHO'S HERE . I WANT TO ALSO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE HEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD HERE IN IOWA ... I WANT TO THANK REPRESENTATIVE ROGER UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD , THANK THEM FOR BEING HERE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE DEMOCRATIC UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD COUNTY . ALSO I WANT TO THANK OUR UNKNOWNWORD UP ON THE STAGE HERE WHO YOU WILL HEAR FROM IN A MINUTE . IN ADDITION TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE FORMER LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR AND A MEMBER OF OUR WOMEN'S LEADERSHIP COUNCIL HERE IN IOWA , UNKNOWNWORD HAS A LOT OF EXPERIENCE ON THE SUBJECT I'M GOING TO BE SPEAKING ABOUT IN A MINUTE , AS DO OUR TWO OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . ONE IS JANE UNKNOWNWORD WHOSE DAUGHTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ASKED ME A QUESTION LAST WEEK WHEN I WAS HERE IN IOWA AND IT TURNED OUT THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS UNKNOWNWORD AND ASKED ME AN EXCELLENT QUESTION AND IT GOT ME THINKING ABOUT ALL OF THE FAMILIES THAT ARE DEALING WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND ALL OF THEIR CHALLENGES . AND DOCTOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO IS ONE OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CARE UNKNOWNWORD AND CARE UNKNOWNWORD IS WITH US NOW . NOW I SEE A LOT OF PEOPLE HOLDING THESE BUMPER UNKNOWNWORD OVER THEIR EYES BECAUSE THE LIGHTS ARE SO POWERFUL ON THEIR EYES AND THAT'S NOT GOOD , IS IT ? SO MAYBE IF SOMEBODY COULD HEAR MY VOICE AND WE COULD DO SOMETHING ABOUT THESE LIGHTS ... I'M SORRY ABOUT THAT , BUT THAT'S MOTHER UNKNOWNWORD AND WE'LL HAVE TO PUT UP WITH THAT . UNKNOWNWORD , TODAY WE ARE HERE AT THE BOYS CLUB BECAUSE OF THE WORK THAT THE BOYS CLUB DOES EVERY SINGLE DAY HERE IN SIOUX CITY . AND ONE OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WHICH THEY HAVE RECOGNIZED IS THE CRITICAL NEED FOR SERVICES FOR CHILDREN WITH UNKNOWNWORD . SO THE BOYS CLUB BEGAN PROVIDING THOSE SERVICES . NOW UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN A STRONG LEADER AND ADVOCATE ON BEHALF OF FAMILIES WITH UNKNOWNWORD FOR YEARS . AS LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR SHE LED THE UNKNOWNWORD ADMINISTRATION'S INITIATIVES FOR HEALTH CARE AND HUMAN SERVICES , AND SHE HAS BEEN AN EFFECTIVE ADVOCATE FOR PEOPLE WITH DISABILITIES . HER WORK WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH SERVES ADULTS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD , IS AN EXAMPLE THAT I'D LIKE TO SEE UNKNOWNWORD ACROSS THE COUNTRY . SHE CAME TO THIS AS MOST PEOPLE WHO ARE ADVOCATES DO , BECAUSE OF HER OWN CHILD . AND TO THE EXTENT WE'RE ADDRESSING UNKNOWNWORD TODAY AS PART OF THE PRESIDENTIAL CAMPAIGN , IT'S BECAUSE OF PARENTS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD WHO FOUGHT FOR THEIR CHILDREN WHEN NO ONE ELSE WOULD EVEN ACKNOWLEDGE THERE WAS A PROBLEM . DRIVEN BY THEIR LOVE AND DEVOTION , MOTHERS AND FATHERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY HAVE RAISED AWARENESS , DEMANDED FUNDING , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR EYES TO THE NEEDS OF SO MANY CHILDREN . NOW , WHEN I WAS IN LAW SCHOOL , I TOOK A SPECIAL YEAR AT THE UNKNOWNWORD CHILD STUDY CENTER . THAT WAS BACK IN THE VERY EARLY 1970'S . AT THAT TIME , SCIENCE WAS STILL UNKNOWNWORD PARENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD . AND THEY PARTICULARLY UNKNOWNWORD MOTHERS . AND I REMEMBER READING SOME OF THE SO-CALLED RESEARCH AND IN PARTICULAR THE WORK OF ONE SCIENTIST WHO HAD A LOT OF NATIONAL AND INTERNATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS UNKNOWNWORD . AND I THOUGHT , YOU KNOW , THAT JUST CAN'T BE RIGHT , THERE'S GOT TO BE MORE TO IT TO THAT . I LATER MOVED TO LITTLE ROCK WHERE ONE OF MY FRIEND HAD A SON WITH UNKNOWNWORD . AND I SPENT TIME IN HER HOME , I SPENT TIME WITH HER AND HER SON AND MY UNKNOWNWORD PERHAPS AS A MOTHER WAS THAT THIS COULD NOT BE THE EXPLANATION . NOW , DESPITE WHAT SCIENCE USED TO DO , UNKNOWNWORD THE PARENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD KIDS , NOW WE KNOW THAT PARENTS ARE THE CHILD'S BEST HOPE TO DEAL WITH WHAT IS A VERY COMPLICATED SET OF CONDITIONS . I WANTED TO DISCUSS THIS ISSUE TODAY BECAUSE THE RECENT INCREASES IN UNKNOWNWORD ARE ALARMING . THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN WITH AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DISORDER , THAT MEANS ACROSS THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM WHAT'S CALLED UNKNOWNWORD SYNDROME , WHERE KIDS WITH IT MAY BE OR ADULTS WITH IT MAY BE NOT AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS YOU OR I WOULD BE BUT THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD PRETTY WELL , ALL THE WAY TO THE MOST SEVERE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD INCLUDING UNKNOWNWORD AND MENTAL UNKNOWNWORD - ALL ALONG THIS UNKNOWNWORD THERE'S SO MANY DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD AND DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD THAT PEOPLE HAVE . THE NUMBER WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DISORDER HAS GROWN FROM 1 IN 10,000 IN UNKNOWNWORD TO 1 IN UNKNOWNWORD IN 2007 , AND THE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO RISE . THE UNKNOWNWORD SOCIETY OF AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS AND THEIR FAMILIES ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY BELIEVE THAT COULD REACH FOUR MILLION IN THE NEXT DECADE . UNKNOWNWORD AFFECTS PEOPLE OF ALL RACIAL , ETHNIC , AND SOCIAL GROUPS , ALTHOUGH IT IS FOUR TIMES MORE LIKELY TO STRIKE BOYS THAN GIRLS WHICH IS WHY THE BOYS CLUB UNKNOWNWORD THIS HERE IN SIOUX CITY IS SUCH A GREAT CONTRIBUTION . AND UNKNOWNWORD IS COSTING THE UNITED STATES AT LEAST 35 BILLION DOLLARS A YEAR . THE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE BECOME ALL TOO UNKNOWNWORD . THE CHILD WHO NEVER MAKES EYE UNKNOWNWORD , DOESN'T NOTICE WHEN HIS DAD COMES HOME AFTER WORK . THE CHILD WHO UNKNOWNWORD BLOCKS OVER AND OVER AND OVER AGAIN . THE CHILD WHO WOULD RATHER UNKNOWNWORD IN A CORNER BY UNKNOWNWORD THAN PLAY WITH OTHER KIDS . THESE CHILDREN HAVE SO MUCH TO CONTRIBUTE , BUT THEY ARE OFTEN TRAPPED INSIDE THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD , UNABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD . YET FOR ALL THE PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD AFFECTS , WE DON'T KNOW THAT MUCH ABOUT WHAT UNKNOWNWORD IT AND WHY IT IS INCREASING IN NUMBER . WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO CURE IT AND WE DON'T EVEN KNOW THE BEST WAYS TO TREAT IT . WE DON'T HAVE ENOUGH SERVICES TO CARE FOR THOSE WHO HAVE IT OR SUPPORT THEIR FAMILIES . I THINK IT'S TIME WE HAD A GOVERNMENT AND A PRESIDENT THAT RECOGNIZED THE SERIOUSNESS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND ADDRESSED IT UNKNOWNWORD . I AM COMMITTED TO THIS CAUSE , AND AS UNKNOWNWORD SAID I HAVE BEEN FIGHTING FOR CHILDREN , PARTICULARLY CHILDREN WITH NEEDS , CHILDREN WITH DISABILITIES , CHILDREN WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD OR NEGLECTED , CHILDREN WITHOUT ADEQUATE EDUCATION OR HEALTH CARE FOR MY ENTIRE ADULT LIFE . ONCE I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND , MY FIRST UNKNOWNWORD WAS TO GO DOOR TO DOOR IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD , MASSACHUSETTS AND FIGURE OUT WHY SO MANY CHILDREN WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD FIGURES WEREN'T UNKNOWNWORD IN SCHOOL . I WENT DOOR TO DOOR , AND HOME AFTER HOME , I FOUND REASON ; I FOUND CHILDREN WHO WERE BLIND OR WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD ; CHILDREN IN WHEELCHAIRS ; CHILDREN WITH UNKNOWNWORD PROBLEMS . THEY WERE KEPT HOME BECAUSE SCHOOLS WOULDN'T ACCOMMODATE THEM . I KNEW THEN THAT I WANTED TO SPEND MY LIFE BEING A VOICE FOR CHILDREN - CHILDREN WHO HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND AND TOO OFTEN FORGOTTEN . I WANTED TO FIGHT TO GIVE ALL CHILDREN THE SAME OPPORTUNITIES I HAD GROWING UP . TODAY , ONE OF THE MOST URGENT - AND LEAST UNDERSTOOD - CHALLENGES FACING OUR CHILDREN IS THIS RISING TIDE OF UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY AS FIRST LADY , I FOUGHT HARD FOR MORE AWARENESS AND MORE FUNDING FOR UNKNOWNWORD . I WAS VERY PROUD WHEN MY HUSBAND SIGNED THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH ACT OF 2000 , WHICH HAD A SPECIAL FOCUS ON UNKNOWNWORD RESEARCH AND LAUNCHED A LONG-TERM STUDY ON ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD ON CHILDREN'S HEALTH . IN THE SENATE , I HELPED DEVELOP AND CO-SPONSORED THE COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD ACT OF 2006 , WHICH WAS SIGNED INTO LAW BY PRESIDENT BUSH . THE BILL AUTHORIZED UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH , SURVEILLANCE , AWARENESS , EARLY UNKNOWNWORD AND EARLY INTERVENTION . AND IN MARCH OF THIS YEAR , I INTRODUCED THE EXPANDING THE PROMISE FOR INDIVIDUALS WITH UNKNOWNWORD ACT ALONG WITH MY COLLEAGUE , SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD FROM UNKNOWNWORD . THIS UNKNOWNWORD ON IMPROVING THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD APPROPRIATE SERVICES THAT WILL CROSS THE LIFE UNKNOWNWORD . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL BUILD ON MY WORK WITH A STRONG COMMITMENT TO FIGHTING UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL START , FIRST , BY INVESTING UNKNOWNWORD IN RESEARCH TO UNDERSTAND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD TO START FINDING UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL INVEST A TOTAL OF UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER FIVE YEARS TO HELP FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD , BECAUSE PRESIDENT BUSH SIGNED THE BILL BUT REFUSED TO PROVIDE THE FUNDING , A UNKNOWNWORD STORY . AND HE JUST VETOED A BILL THAT CONGRESS INCLUDED FUNDING FOR UNKNOWNWORD IN . UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO FUND RESEARCH TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , INCLUDING POSSIBLE ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD . THAT INCLUDES EXPANDING OUR SYSTEM FOR HEALTH TRACKING , SO THAT WE CAN LOOK FOR UNKNOWNWORD BETWEEN THE ENVIRONMENT AND THE RISE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER DISEASES . THAT'S SOMETHING THAT I'VE BEEN FIGHTING FOR SINCE 2001 . I'VE INTRODUCED AN ENVIRONMENTAL HEALTH TRACKING BILL EVERY CONGRESS SINCE THEN BECAUSE I THINK WE NEED TO FACE UP TO THE FACT THAT THERE ARE THREE MAIN UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD OR CONDITIONS THAT IMPACT PEOPLE : UNKNOWNWORD , BEHAVIOR AND ENVIRONMENT AND USUALLY IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE OR MORE OF THOSE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE HAVEN'T DONE ENOUGH TO REALLY FIGURE OUT TO WHAT IT IS WE ARE UNKNOWNWORD OURSELVES AND OUR CHILDREN TO FROM THE ENVIRONMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD , PERHAPS , A UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSE , THAT MAKES PEOPLE WHO ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD SHOW THAT . USUALLY IT'S DIAGNOSED AROUND 18 MONTHS , IF YOU'RE LUCKY TO FIND SOMEBODY WHO KNOWS THE CONDITIONS . UNKNOWNWORD OF TIMES IT DOESN'T HAPPEN UNTIL THE CHILD IS 4 OR UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT MEANS THAT YOU'VE UNKNOWNWORD THE TREATMENT AND INTERVENTION THAT COULD HELP . I'LL ALSO CREATE AN UNKNOWNWORD TASK FORCE UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENTS , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SERVICES . I'M UNKNOWNWORD THIS AFTER WHAT HAS HAPPENED IN BREAST CANCER . BREAST CANCER SURVIVORS BECAME UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND SCIENTISTS AND UNKNOWNWORD IN FINDING WHAT WAS GOING ON THAT CAUSED BREAST CANCER AND WHAT THE BEST TREATMENTS WERE . ONCE THE TASK FORCE HAS DONE ITS WORK , I'LL ACT ON ITS UNKNOWNWORD . MORE RESEARCH IS OUR BEST HOPE FOR COMBATING UNKNOWNWORD , AND , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL FUND IT . FOR THE CHILDREN AND ADULTS WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL INVEST IN THE BEST POSSIBLE CARE THROUGHOUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL COMMIT $500 MILLION ANNUALLY TO PROVIDE CARE AND IMPROVE THE QUALITY OF LIFE FOR INDIVIDUALS LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD . THIS STARTS WITH BETTER UNKNOWNWORD . THE AMERICAN ACADEMY OF UNKNOWNWORD RECENTLY CALLED FOR A UNIVERSAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR ALL CHILDREN UNDER THE AGE OF 2 . NOW , I APPLAUD THIS AND WE'RE GOING TO HAVE TO REALLY ENCOURAGE THE ACADEMY AND UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD TO LEARN ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND BEGIN TO COORDINATE INFORMATION SO THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD IT EARLIER . TO UNKNOWNWORD THOSE EFFORTS , I'LL ENSURE THAT WE GET UNKNOWNWORD INFORMATION TO PROFESSIONALS WHO DEAL WITH YOUNG CHILDREN THROUGH FEDERAL PROGRAMS SUCH AS HEAD START , MEDICAID AND UNKNOWNWORD . NEXT , I'LL EXPAND ACCESS TO UNKNOWNWORD CARE SO THAT WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM DIAGNOSIS TO TREATMENT . TODAY , THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN UNKNOWNWORD IS GROWING FAR FASTER THAN THE CARE AVAILABLE . THAT MEANS PARENTS OFTEN HAVE TO HEAR A DOCTOR SAY : UNKNOWNWORD CHILD HAS UNKNOWNWORD ," AND THEN GET SENT AWAY WITH NO GOOD OPTIONS FOR CARE . THIS IS ESPECIALLY TRAGIC BECAUSE WE KNOW EARLY INTERVENTION CAN MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE . AS UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN REACH UNKNOWNWORD , WE'LL SUPPORT THEM IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WHEREVER POSSIBLE . THE NUMBER OF CHILDREN IN PUBLIC SCHOOLS WITH UNKNOWNWORD HAS DOUBLED IN THE PAST THREE YEARS ALONE . BUT THE TRAINING FOR TEACHERS HASN'T ; IN FACT , A LOT OF TEACHERS GET NO TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL PROVIDE FUNDING FOR TEACHER TRAINING SO THEY CAN FULFILL THEIR MISSION OF TEACHING EVERY CHILD . AND WE WON'T STOP CARING ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD INDIVIDUALS JUST BECAUSE THEY GROW UP . WITH ACCESS TO THE RIGHT UNKNOWNWORD OF SERVICES , INCLUDING HOUSING , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE CAN HELP ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD LIVE RICH AND FULL LIVES . SO I WILL HELP STATES CREATE AND PROVIDE APPROPRIATE SERVICES FOR ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD . FOR PARENTS , WE'LL CREATE AN ONLINE NATIONAL TECHNICAL ASSISTANCE CENTER TO PROVIDE THE BEST POSSIBLE INFORMATION ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENTS , UNKNOWNWORD , AND SERVICES . AND FINALLY , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL FUND QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN . MY AMERICAN HEALTH CHOICES PLAN LETS YOU KEEP YOUR EXISTING COVERAGE IF YOU LIKE IT , BUT IT PROVIDES AFFORDABLE CHOICES IF YOU DON'T HAVE THEM , AND IT COVERS EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN . WHAT HAPPENS IN FAMILIES OF UNKNOWNWORD , OR FAMILIES WITH DIABETES OR FAMILIES WITH A HISTORY OF CANCER OR HEART DISEASE OR ANY OTHER CONDITION , IS THAT UNKNOWNWORD INSURANCE IS SO EXPENSIVE YOU CAN'T AFFORD IT , WHEN THE INSURANCE DOESN'T COVER THE VERY THING YOU NEED IT FOR . EVERYONE WILL HAVE ACCESS TO THE SAME CHOICES MEMBERS OF CONGRESS HAVE , WHICH INCLUDES MENTAL HEALTH CARE . I ALWAYS SAY , IF IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , IT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR AMERICAN FAMILIES . UNDER MY PLAN , YOU AND YOUR CHILD WILL NEVER BE DENIED COVERAGE BECAUSE OF UNKNOWNWORD CONDITIONS OR RISK FACTORS . PARENTS WILL NO LONGER BE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD PREMIUMS JUST BECAUSE THEIR CHILDREN HAVE UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN ALL AMERICANS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTHCARE , WE'LL BE ABLE TO REACH SO MANY MORE CHILDREN EARLY ON . MY HEALTH PLAN , MY UNKNOWNWORD AGENDA , AND ALL OF THE POLICIES THAT I'VE PUT FORWARD ARE UNITED BY MY BELIEF THAT IT'S UP TO US TO RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN , AND ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS A CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . WE HAVE LEARNED THAT CHILDREN AND ADULTS WITH UNKNOWNWORD HAVE GREAT POTENTIAL INDEED . THESE ARE NOT ONLY SPECIAL NEEDS INDIVIDUALS , THESE ARE SPECIAL INDIVIDUALS . THEY HAVE A LOT TO OFFER . JUST LAST WEEK , AT AN EVENT IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , A YOUNG WOMAN WITH UNKNOWNWORD - I HAD NO IDEA , I WAS JUST LOOKING OUT AT A CROWD LIKE THIS , AND SHE WAS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HER HAND WITH THAT BIG UNKNOWNWORD ON HER FACE , ASKING A QUESTION ABOUT POLLUTION AND PROBLEM OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND SHE SAID LATER , SHE IS UNKNOWNWORD WITH UNKNOWNWORD ." NOW , I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT SHE WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN OUR WORLD , AND I AM SO PLEASED TO BE JOINED BY UNKNOWNWORD MOM - JANE UNKNOWNWORD - AND HER DOCTOR - DR . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - TODAY . UNKNOWNWORD NOT ALONE . SO WE SHOULD NEVER GIVE UP ON ANY CHILD ; I THINK THAT IS ONE OF OUR OBLIGATIONS . AND TOGETHER , WE CAN HELP ALL THOSE LIVING WITH UNKNOWNWORD TO LIVE UP TO THEIR POTENTIAL . AND WE CAN COMMIT OURSELVES TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS REALLY DIFFICULT AND VERY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD CONDITION THAT STRIKES CHILDREN , LITERALLY OUT OF THE BLUE . THERE IS NO UNKNOWNWORD FOR IT , WE DON'T KNOW IT'S COMING , AND UNKNOWNWORD THEY ARE NOT QUITE SURE WHAT IS HAPPENING UNTIL THE DIAGNOSIS IS DELIVERED . SO , NOW I WANT TO TURN TO THREE PEOPLE WHO HAVE LIVED WITH IT , WHO CAN ADD TO WHAT I SAID BEFORE WE TURN TO TAKE YOUR QUESTIONS ON ANY ISSUE THAT'S ON YOUR MINDS . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU . UNKNOWNWORD , MY GOODNESS , THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . UNKNOWNWORD , THANK YOU . THAT WAS ABSOLUTELY WONDERFUL . AND THOSE OF YOU FROM UNKNOWNWORD KNOW UNKNOWNWORD DUFFY AS THE UNKNOWNWORD TEACHER , THE INSPIRATION FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT THE HIGH SCHOOL . AND I ASKED HER HOW LONG SHE'D BEEN TEACHING , AND SHE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD YEARS ." AND LET'S GIVE HER A UNKNOWNWORD OF APPLAUSE FOR HER DEDICATION TO EDUCATION . THANK YOU , UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] I ALSO WANT TO THANK DR . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD COMMUNITY SCHOOL UNKNOWNWORD , FOR BEING HERE . THANK YOU SO MUCH , DR . UNKNOWNWORD . AND TIM UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD COUNTY UNKNOWNWORD AND ONE OF MY PRECINCT CAPTAINS , I THANK HIM FOR COMING . I ALSO WANT TO THANK AND RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO IS THE POLITICAL DIRECTOR OF UNKNOWNWORD COUNCIL UNKNOWNWORD . AND THERE IS SOMEONE ELSE I WANT TO INTRODUCE . THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE FIELD ORGANIZER FOR UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD COUNTIES . WHERE IS UNKNOWNWORD ? IF SHE CAN UNKNOWNWORD OR -- THERE SHE IS BACK THERE . THANK YOU SO MUCH . AND SOMEONE ELSE WHO IS VERY , VERY DEAR TO ME , WHO HAS SERVED IOWA FOR MANY YEARS AND HAS BEEN SUCH A GREAT CHAMPION OF EDUCATION AND UNKNOWNWORD , AND THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THANK YOU SO MUCH , UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , I'LL BE ALL OVER THE STATE TODAY AND TOMORROW , AND THEN I THINK WE'RE ALL GOING TO GIVE YOU A BREAK FOR UNKNOWNWORD . DON'T YOU THINK THAT'S A GOOD IDEA ? SO EVERYBODY CAN UNKNOWNWORD WITH FRIENDS AND FAMILY . THAT'S WHAT I'LL BE DOING ; GOING BACK HOME AND WORKING WITH MY DAUGHTER TO CREATE UNKNOWNWORD DINNER , SOMETHING THAT WE LIKE TO DO EVERY YEAR . THEN WE'LL BE BACK OVER THE WEEKEND , TRAVELING THE STATE , MEETING AS MANY IOWANS AS I POSSIBLY CAN . BUT TODAY I WANTED TO COME TO UNKNOWNWORD TO REALLY SOUND THE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT OUR ECONOMY . I THINK IT'S IMPORTANT THAT WE TAKE A FEW MINUTES TO UNKNOWNWORD LOOK AT WHAT'S HAPPENING IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY , BECAUSE THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL INHERIT , UNFORTUNATELY , A LOT OF PROBLEMS . NOW , THIS IS KIND OF A UNKNOWNWORD SITUATION FOR ME , BECAUSE WHEN MY HUSBAND BECAME PRESIDENT HE INHERITED A LOT OF ECONOMIC PROBLEMS . AS SOMEONE SAID THE OTHER DAY , THERE SEEMS TO BE A PATTERN HERE : IT TAKES A CLINTON TO CLEAN UP AFTER A BUSH . AND SO ... [APPLAUSE ] AND SO I WANT TO SPEND SOME TIME TELLING YOU HOW I SEE THIS PROBLEM AND TALKING ABOUT SOME OF THE THINGS THAT I WANT TO DO TO ADDRESS IT , BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL NOT HAVE A MINUTE TO WASTE . YOU KNOW , WE'VE GOT AN ECONOMY THAT IS INCREASINGLY INTERCONNECTED WITH THE GLOBAL ECONOMY . IT IS SHAPED EACH DAY , NOT JUST BY THE BILLIONS OF DECISIONS THAT UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS MAKE , BUT BY BILLIONS MORE THAT ARE MADE AROUND THE WORLD . AND SOMETHING THAT NOW HAPPENS FAR AWAY FROM IOWA CAN HAVE A RIPPLE EFFECT THAT IMPACTS THE QUALITY OF LIFE AND THE STANDARD OF LIVING FOR AMERICANS . OUR ECONOMY IN RECENT MONTHS HAS BEEN THE SUBJECT OF INCREASING WORRY . WE'VE GOT RISING OIL PRICES ; WE'VE GOT A DEEPENING HOUSING CRISIS ; WE HAVE A FALLING DOLLAR , IN TERMS OF ITS VALUE ; WE HAVE A BALLOONING NATIONAL DEBT ; AND WE HAVE WEAKENING CONSUMER CONFIDENCE . JUST 13 PERCENT OF AMERICANS SAY THAT ECONOMIC CONDITIONS IN OUR COUNTRY ARE POSITIVE . THAT IS THE LOWEST READING SINCE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ORGANIZATION STARTED ASKING THE QUESTION BACK IN UNKNOWNWORD . AND IN UNKNOWNWORD , IT WAS THE LOWEST THAT IT HAD BEEN IN 40 YEARS . SO WE UNDERSTAND THAT WE'VE GOT REAL PROBLEMS , BUT WE SEE NOTHING HAPPENING UNDER THIS PRESIDENT TO ADDRESS THOSE PROBLEMS . UNFORTUNATELY , THE PRESIDENT EITHER DOESN'T SEE THEM OR UNKNOWNWORD TO DEAL WITH THEM . AND THE NET EFFECT OF IT ALL IS THAT THE ECONOMY IS NOT WORKING FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES . NOW , WE ALL HOPE THAT THE ECONOMY WILL REMAIN UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE KNOW THAT , IF WE MAKE THE RIGHT CHOICES , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CAN , ONCE AGAIN , CREATE MILLIONS OF JOBS AND LIFT UP THE MIDDLE CLASS . BUT INSTEAD OF POSITIVE POLICIES AIMED AT MAKING THAT HAPPEN , WE'VE HAD THE OPPOSITE : RECKLESS FISCAL POLICIES AND A PRESIDENT WITH A TRAGIC HABIT OF IGNORING PROBLEMS UNTIL THEY BECOME CRISES . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL BE A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY AT A TIME WHEN THE BILLS FROM EIGHT YEARS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD WILL BE COMING DUE . THE NEXT PRESIDENT WILL HAVE TO TURN AROUND OUR NATION AND OUR ECONOMY . MORE THAN EVER BEFORE , WORKERS WILL NEED GOOD JOB TRAINING FOR THE JOBS OF THIS NEW CENTURY , BUT THERE IS ONE JOB WE CAN'T AFFORD ON - UNKNOWNWORD TRAINING FOR : THAT IS THE JOB OF OUR NEXT PRESIDENT . THAT COULD BE THE UNKNOWNWORD JOB TRAINING IN HISTORY . EVERY DAY SPENT LEARNING THE UNKNOWNWORD IS ANOTHER DAY OF RISING COSTS , MOUNTING DEFICITS , AND GROWING ANXIETY FOR OUR FAMILIES . AND THEY CANNOT AFFORD TO KEEP WAITING . WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO UNDERSTANDS THE MAGNITUDE AND COMPLEXITY OF THE CHALLENGES WE FACE AND HAS THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO ADDRESS THEM FROM DAY ONE , A PRESIDENT WHO HAS FAITH THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE AMERICAN ECONOMY ARE UP TO THE TASK . AND IF YOU GIVE ME THAT CHANCE , I WILL BE THAT PRESIDENT FOR ALL OF YOU . [APPLAUSE ] IN RECENT MONTHS , WE'VE SEEN A NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . FIRST , WE HAVE A GROWING CRISIS IN OUR HOUSING MARKET THAT IS THREATENING OUR FAMILIES AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL MARKETS . OVER THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , AS INCOMES FELL , WAGES STAGNATED , MANY FAMILIES WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO RISKY MORTGAGES TO FINANCE THEIR HOMES , WITH RATES THAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND WHAT THEY COULD AFFORD . AND REGULATORS DID LITTLE TO CRACK DOWN ON UNKNOWNWORD BROKERS UNKNOWNWORD LOANS TO UNKNOWNWORD BUYERS . THE RESULT IS UNKNOWNWORD MILLION FORECLOSURES SO FAR THIS YEAR , NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD IN IOWA ALONE THIS PAST THREE MONTHS . THAT IS ALMOST DOUBLE THE FIGURE FROM LAST YEAR . AND HOME PRICES ACROSS AMERICA ARE DROPPING . AND UNFORTUNATELY , A LOT OF EXPERTS UNKNOWNWORD THEY WILL DROP EVEN FURTHER . THAT'S SERIOUS NO MATTER HOW YOU LOOK AT IT , BECAUSE 60 PERCENT OF THE TOTAL WEALTH OF MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES IS IN THEIR HOME EQUITY . AND HOME EQUITY WITHDRAWALS ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN 8 PERCENT OF A FAMILY'S UNKNOWNWORD INCOME IN THE LAST COUPLE OF YEARS . SO AS HOUSING PRICES DECLINE , PEOPLE HAVE LESS MONEY TO DRAW ON FOR EVERYTHING FROM MEDICAL BILLS TO COLLEGE TUITION . TO MAKE MATTERS WORSE , ALL OF THESE MORTGAGE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE CAPITAL MARKETS . BANKS HAVE SUFFERED ENORMOUS LOSSES ON SECURITIES LINKED TO MORTGAGES . THEY'VE WRITTEN DOWN MORE THAN $30 BILLION IN THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . INVESTORS ARE INCREASINGLY UNKNOWNWORD , COMPANIES ARE STRUGGLING TO RAISE THE CAPITAL THEY NEED TO EXPAND , AND BANKS ARE INCREASINGLY UNWILLING TO PROVIDE MORTGAGES AND OTHER LOANS TO FAMILIES . SECOND , SKYROCKETING ENERGY PRICES ARE SQUEEZING MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES ALREADY STRUGGLING WITH FALLING INCOME AND RISING COSTS . YOU KNOW , AFTER SEPTEMBER 11TH , WE HAD A HISTORIC OPPORTUNITY TO CALL AMERICANS , TO CALL ALL OF US TO ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . INSTEAD , WE OUTSOURCED OUR ENERGY POLICY TO DICK CHENEY AND THE OIL COMPANIES . AND TODAY WE ARE EVEN MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL THAN WE WERE ON SEPTEMBER THE 11TH . OIL PRICES HAVE INCREASED MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THIS YEAR . PRICES ARE MOVING UP . IT'S NOW NEARLY $100 A BARREL . GAS HIT UNKNOWNWORD PER UNKNOWNWORD NATIONWIDE , THE HIGHEST PRICE EVER FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR . AS A RESULT , AVERAGE FAMILIES ARE SPENDING ROUGHLY $2,000 MORE A YEAR ON ENERGY COSTS , FOR ELECTRICITY , HOME HEATING , AND GAS . THAT'S A HUGE INCREASE . IT'S LIKE A $2,000 ENERGY TAX IN JUST THE LAST SEVEN YEARS , MORE THAN THREE TIMES WHAT THE TYPICAL AMERICAN FAMILY RECEIVED FROM THE BUSH TAX CUTS . I TALK TO A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO ARE WORRIED THEY'RE NOT GOING TO BE ABLE TO GET THROUGH THE HOLIDAYS AND THE WINTER MONTHS . WE'VE BEEN BLESSED ; THE WEATHER HAS NOT YET GOTTEN COLD . SO A LOT OF PEOPLE HAVE BEEN HOLDING THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IF WE DO HAVE A COLD UNKNOWNWORD , YOU KNOW WHAT WILL HAPPEN : SO MANY FOLKS WILL FIND IT DIFFICULT TO PAY THE PRICE . THIRD , WHILE CORPORATE PROFITS ARE REACHING NEW UNKNOWNWORD , OUR LABOR MARKET IS JUST NOT WORKING FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES . THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE FACT THAT THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE IS UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . BUT DO YOU KNOW ONE OF THE REASONS IT'S UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT ? IT'S BECAUSE MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE HAVE STOPPED LOOKING FOR WORK . WE'VE HAD MILLIONS OF AMERICANS JUST DROP OUT OF THE LABOR FORCE . IF YOU UNKNOWNWORD WHERE WE ARE TODAY WITH WHERE WE WERE WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK OFFICE , IF YOU HAD THE SAME NUMBER OF PEOPLE ACTUALLY WORKING AND ACTIVELY LOOKING FOR JOBS , THE UNEMPLOYMENT RATE WOULD BE CLOSER TO UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT . CORPORATE PROFITS , HOWEVER , ARE AT A UNKNOWNWORD HIGH . SO HERE WE UNKNOWNWORD VERY HIGH CORPORATE PROFITS , AND THE AVERAGE AMERICAN FAMILY HAS LOST $1,000 IN INCOME IN THE LAST SEVEN YEARS . AND OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD PERIOD THAT JUST ENDED IN JULY , THE SLOW GROWTH IN WAGES ACTUALLY ACCOUNTED FOR MORE THAN TWO-THIRDS OF THE INCREASE IN CORPORATE PROFITS . WHAT DOES THAT MEAN ? WELL , THE PROFITS GO UP , BUT UNLIKE EVERY OTHER TIME IN OUR HISTORY , THE CEOS AND THE BOARDS OF THESE COMPANIES ARE NOT SHARING THE WEALTH . SO COMPANIES ARE ACTUALLY PROFITING OFF OF KEEPING WORKERS ' WAGES STAGNANT . AND AMERICAN WORKERS ? WE'RE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER . WE'RE THE HARDEST WORKING PEOPLE IN THE WORLD . SO EVEN THOUGH AMERICAN WORKERS ARE INCREASING THEIR PRODUCTIVITY , THEIR WAGES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD FLAT . AND THE GAP BETWEEN THE RICH AND EVERYBODY ELSE HAS ONLY GOTTEN BROADER . IN 2005 , THE LAST YEAR I COULD FIND THE NUMBERS FOR , ALL INCOME GAINS WENT TO THE TOP 10 PERCENT OF HOUSEHOLDS , WHILE THE BOTTOM 90 PERCENT SAW THEIR INCOMES DECLINE . THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA THAT I GREW UP IN ; THAT IS NOT THE COUNTRY THAT I BELIEVE IS HOLDING OUT THE PROMISE OF PROSPERITY FOR PEOPLE WILLING TO WORK HARD AND TAKE RESPONSIBILITY . THE WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS HELD 22 PERCENT OF AMERICA'S INCOME . THAT'S AN ASTONISHING FIGURE , AND IT IS THE HIGHEST LEVEL OF INCOME INEQUALITY SINCE THE BEGINNING OF THE GREAT DEPRESSION IN 1929 . FOURTH , SEVEN YEARS OF FISCAL RECKLESSNESS HAS DRIVEN UP OUR DEBT , UNKNOWNWORD CONFIDENCE IN OUR ECONOMY , AND LEFT US UNKNOWNWORD TO FOREIGN UNKNOWNWORD . SINCE PRESIDENT BUSH TOOK OFFICE , WE'VE SEEN THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR NATION'S FINANCIAL HEALTH IN HISTORY . RECKLESS TAX CUTS FOR THE WEALTHY , BLOATED SPENDING THAT WASN'T PAID FOR HAVE PUSHED UP OUR NATIONAL DEBT TO UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . THINK ABOUT THAT . WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH BECAME PRESIDENT , HE INHERITED A BALANCED BUDGET AND A SURPLUS , A PROJECTED SURPLUS OF UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . NOW WE'RE BACK INTO DEFICITS , AND WE HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION DEBT . THAT FORCES US EVERY DAY TO BORROW MONEY FROM FOREIGN COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA . SO WHEN PEOPLE ACROSS IOWA ASK ME WHY IT'S SO HARD FOR THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TO GET TOUGH ON CHINA AND OTHER TRADING UNKNOWNWORD , I TELL THEM BECAUSE THESE COUNTRIES ARE NOW OUR BANKERS . WE'RE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . HOW CAN WE TRULY ENFORCE TRADE LAWS AGAINST A COUNTRY LIKE CHINA WHEN WE HAVE TO BORROW MONEY TO FEED THE MASSIVE DEBT THAT GEORGE BUSH HAS DRIVEN UP ? AMERICA'S ECONOMIC STANDING IN THE WORLD HAS UNKNOWNWORD . THE VALUE OF THE DOLLAR HAS BEEN DROPPING . IT IS NOW LESS VALUED THAN OTHER UNKNOWNWORD , SOMETHING ELSE THAT UNKNOWNWORD A LOT OF ANXIETY , IF YOU LOOK OUT AND SEE WHAT THAT MIGHT MEAN IN YEARS TO COME . FINALLY , WE FACE NEW THREATS THAT NEITHER THE PRESIDENT NOR FEDERAL REGULATORS HAVE ADEQUATELY ACKNOWLEDGED OR ADDRESSED . TAKE THE RISK OF SO-CALLED UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCTS THAT WALL STREET IS SELLING . THESE PRODUCTS OFFER NEW OPPORTUNITIES FOR INVESTORS TO UNKNOWNWORD PORTFOLIOS AND PROTECT THEMSELVES AGAINST CERTAIN RISKS . FOR EXAMPLE , A FARMER HERE IN IOWA WHO'S WORRIED ABOUT THE PRICE OF CORN COULD BUY A UNKNOWNWORD THAT INCREASES IN VALUE WHEN THE PRICE OF CORN FALLS , SO REGARDLESS OF WHAT HAPPENS WITH HIS UNKNOWNWORD , HE HAS A CHANCE TO BREAK EVEN . BUT UNKNOWNWORD ALSO CREATE NEW RISKS . THEY CAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN VALUE . IT ISN'T ALWAYS CLEAR WHO UNKNOWNWORD THEM OR HOW MUCH THEY ARE REALLY WORTH . OWNERS DON'T ALWAYS UNDERSTAND THE RISKS , WHICH IS WHY EVEN THE INVESTMENT BANKS THAT CREATED THEM ARE LOSING BILLIONS OF DOLLARS ON THESE UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE RIPPLES ARE BEING FELT FROM WALL STREET TO MAIN STREET . I BELIEVE IN OUR MARKETS , BUT MARKETS WORK BEST WHEN THERE IS INFORMATION FLOW . AND A LOT OF THESE NEW FINANCIAL PRODUCTS ARE NOT UNKNOWNWORD . THE MARKET DOESN'T HAVE ENOUGH INFORMATION ABOUT THEM , AND CERTAINLY BUYERS DON'T . TODAY , WE NEED A SENSIBLE MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD REGULATION AND A UNKNOWNWORD APPROACH TO A RISK THAT CAN HURT THE INNOCENT , AS WELL AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . ANOTHER NEW CHALLENGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD IS THE GROWTH OF SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS . NOW , WHAT ARE THESE ? THESE ARE INVESTMENT FUNDS UNKNOWNWORD BY FOREIGN GOVERNMENTS . THEY'RE NOT BUSINESSES . A GOVERNMENT OF A BIG OIL-PRODUCING COUNTRY CREATES A FUND OF MONEY , PUTS A NAME ON IT , CALLING IT AN INVESTMENT FUND , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE INVESTMENTS OUT OF THIS FUND . THEY'RE USING THESE FUNDS TO BUY UP BILLIONS OF DOLLARS WORTH OF AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD , REAL UNKNOWNWORD , AND CORPORATIONS . NOW , WHERE EXACTLY ARE COUNTRIES GETTING THE MONEY FOR THESE FUNDS ? THEY'RE GETTING IT FROM US . OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL MEANS WE SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS TO COUNTRIES LIKE SAUDI ARABIA AND UNKNOWNWORD . OUR TRADE DEFICIT AND OUR BALLOONING DEBTS MEAN WE SEND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN PAYMENTS TO COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA . THESE COUNTRIES THEN TURN AROUND AND USE OUR DOLLARS TO BUY UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY . TODAY , SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS HOLD AN ESTIMATED UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION . WITHIN A DECADE , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HOLD FIVE TIMES THAT MUCH . WE HAVE NEVER SEEN ANYTHING LIKE THIS , AND YOU DON'T HEAR A UNKNOWNWORD OUT OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION . NOW , WHY EXACTLY ARE THESE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS CAUSE FOR CONCERN ? WELL , LET ME ASK YOU THIS : HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT USED ITS SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUND TO BUY AN AMERICAN CAR COMPANY AND MOVED IT OVERSEAS ? RIGHT NOW , THAT GOVERNMENT MIGHT BE OUR UNKNOWNWORD , BUT WHAT IF THEY BECAME OUR UNKNOWNWORD , AS WELL ? AND HOW WOULD YOU FEEL IF COUNTRIES USED THEIR INVESTMENTS IN AMERICA TO INFLUENCE OUR FOREIGN POLICY ? WHAT IF A COUNTRY SET OUT TO BUY COMPANIES THAT COMPETE WITH THEIR NATIONAL INDUSTRIES AND SHUT THEM DOWN ? I DON'T THINK WE'D BE COMFORTABLE WITH OUR OWN GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD IN REAL UNKNOWNWORD OR BUYING UP COMPANIES , AND WE SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE IDEA OF A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT DOING THESE THINGS IN OUR COUNTRY . IN SHORT , THESE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS REPRESENT A POTENTIAL THREAT TO OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY IF WE DON'T ACT NOW TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR IMPACT ON OUR ECONOMY . SO TODAY WE FACE AN UNKNOWNWORD OF SERIOUS AND GROWING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES THAT CALL FOR A PRESIDENT WILLING TO MAKE RESPONSIBLE ECONOMIC STEWARDSHIP A KEY PRIORITY , WILLING TO CONFRONT COMPLEX PROBLEMS AND DEVISE COMPREHENSIVE RESPONSES , A PRESIDENT WHO ALWAYS PUTS THE MIDDLE CLASS FIRST . BUT FOR SEVEN YEARS , WE'VE HAD JUST THE OPPOSITE . IN FACT , WE'VE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO'S UNKNOWNWORD THE ECONOMY WITH JUST ONE SIMPLE PRINCIPLE IN MIND : TAKE CARE OF THOSE AT THE TOP AND LET MIDDLE - CLASS FAMILIES FEND FOR THEMSELVES . HE CALLS IT THE OWNERSHIP SOCIETY , BUT IT'S REALLY NOTHING MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD ON YOUR OWN ." AND WHAT DO WE GET FROM PRESIDENT BUSH WHEN THE FACT IS THAT MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES ' INCOME HAS DROPPED $1,000 ? A CALL TO CUT TAXES AGAIN FOR AMERICA'S LARGEST CORPORATIONS . AS OUR TRADE DEFICIT HAS DOUBLED AND WE'VE LOST AN ESTIMATED 1'8 MILLION JOBS TO CHINA , WHAT WAS PRESIDENT BUSH'S RESPONSE ? HE THREATENED TO VETO TRADE UNKNOWNWORD ASSISTANCE FOR DISPLACED WORKERS . WHEN FORECLOSURES DOUBLED LAST YEAR , WHAT WAS PRESIDENT BUSH'S RESPONSE ? NOTHING . WHEN FAMILIES AND COMMUNITY GROUPS REPORTED THAT UNKNOWNWORD BUYERS AND LENDERS WERE UNKNOWNWORD ON HOMEBUYERS , NOTHING . BUT WHEN THE HOUSING CRISIS STARTED TO THREATEN LARGE WALL STREET INVESTMENT BANKS , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION UNKNOWNWORD INTO ACTION . IT UNKNOWNWORD MEETINGS AND CONFERENCE CALLS WITH THE HEADS OF MAJOR WALL STREET FIRMS , EAGER TO HELP HOWEVER THEY COULD . WHAT WAS PRESIDENT BUSH'S ANSWER TO SENIORS WHO CAN'T AFFORD TO RETIRE ? UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY . WHAT ABOUT RISING OIL PRICES ? VETO FUNDING TO HELP LOW-INCOME FAMILIES PAY THEIR ENERGY BILLS . NINE MILLION CHILDREN WITHOUT HEALTH CARE ? VETO HEALTH CARE FOR UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN . HIS ANSWER TO MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES WHO FEEL LIKE THEY'RE STANDING ON A UNKNOWNWORD DOOR , JUST ONE PINK SLIP OR ONE MEDICAL DIAGNOSIS OR ONE MISSED MORTGAGE PAYMENT AWAY FROM FALLING THROUGH AND LOSING EVERYTHING ? TAX CUT AFTER TAX CUT FOR THE WEALTHIEST OF AMERICANS . NOW , IT'S NO SURPRISE THAT THE PRESIDENT CONTINUES TO STAND BY HIS FAILED ECONOMIC POLICIES . THIS IS , AFTER ALL , A MAN WHO BELIEVES THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS A VIRTUE . WHAT IS TRULY UNKNOWNWORD , HOWEVER , IS THAT THE REPUBLICAN CANDIDATES FOR PRESIDENT ARE DETERMINED TO CONTINUE THESE FAILED POLICIES . IN FACT , WE CAN DESCRIBE THEIR APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY IN FOUR SIMPLE WORDS : MORE OF THE SAME . THEY SEE UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION IN DEBT AND SAY , "WHY NOT UNKNOWNWORD MORE ?" THEY SEE TAX CUTS FOR WEALTHY AMERICANS AND BIG CORPORATIONS AND SAY , "WHY NOT MORE ?" THEY SEE ONE ATTEMPT TO UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY AND SAY , "WHY NOT ONE MORE ?" IN SHORT , THEY SEE EIGHT YEARS OF BUSH UNKNOWNWORD AND SAY , "WHY NOT EIGHT MORE ?" WELL , HERE'S MY RESPONSE TO THAT : YOU'VE GOT UNTIL JANUARY 20 , 2009 . AND NOT ONE DAY MORE WILL WE PUT UP WITH THESE FAILED POLICIES . [APPLAUSE ] I CAN'T WAIT TO GET ON A STAGE TO DEBATE THE REPUBLICAN NOMINEE AS WE MAKE THE CASE FOR CHANGE AND THEY ARGUE FOR THE STATUS QUO . TO THEM , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD NO BUSH ECONOMIC POLICY BEHIND ." BUT TODAY , AMERICA IS READY FOR CHANGE , BUT CHANGE IS JUST A WORD WITHOUT THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN . IT'S EASY TO GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT RESTORING THE MIDDLE CLASS , BUT IT IS HARD TO ACTUALLY DO IT . IT'S EASY TO MAKE UP A PROGRAM THAT UNKNOWNWORD EVERY ECONOMIC PROBLEM , BUT IT'S HARD TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO PAY FOR IT . WE'VE BEEN HERE BEFORE WITH A PRESIDENT WHO LEAVES THE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD BEAR ON ELECTION DAY . THIS TIME , HOWEVER , WE WON'T JUST HAVE TO CLEAN UP THE ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD HE MADE . WE'LL ALSO HAVE TO END THE WAR HE STARTED AND ADDRESS THE HEALTH CARE CRISIS HE LEFT BEHIND . [APPLAUSE ] SO WE DON'T NEED MORE REPUBLICAN SCARE TACTICS ABOUT A SOCIAL SECURITY CRISIS . AND WE DON'T NEED A UNKNOWNWORD TAX INCREASE THAT WILL HIT FAMILIES ALREADY FACING HIGHER ENERGY , HEALTH CARE AND COLLEGE COSTS . WHAT WE NEED IS TO FOCUS ON THE REAL CRISES OF HEALTH CARE AND MEDICARE AND ON EXPANDING OPPORTUNITIES FOR POOR , WORKING AND MIDDLE - CLASS FAMILIES WHO ARE STRUGGLING NOW . IF THE GATHERING ECONOMIC CHALLENGES STRIKE ALL AT ONCE IN A PERFECT STORM , THESE FAMILIES , AMERICA'S FAMILIES , WILL BE THE HARDEST HIT . SO , IN SHORT , PRESIDENT BUSH HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE MIDDLE CLASS , UNKNOWNWORD THE PLAYING FIELD AGAINST THEM , AND SAID , UNKNOWNWORD ON YOUR OWN ." REPUBLICANS RUNNING TO REPLACE HIM SAY , "IT'S TIME FOR MORE OF THE SAME ." AND I SAY WE NEED A NEW DIRECTION . WE HAD AN ECONOMIC STRATEGY THAT WORKED IN THE 1990S . WE BELIEVED THAT FISCAL RESPONSIBILITY COULD UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMIC GROWTH , SO WE BALANCED THE FEDERAL BUDGET . WE SAW RECORD SURPLUSES , 22 MILLION NEW JOBS , THE LONGEST ECONOMIC EXPANSION IN AMERICAN HISTORY . WE BELIEVE THAT INVESTMENTS IN OUR PEOPLE WERE INVESTMENTS IN OUR ECONOMY , SO WE EXPANDED THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT , PROVIDED HEALTH INSURANCE TO SIX MILLION UNKNOWNWORD CHILDREN , UNKNOWNWORD IN HEAD START AND STUDENT LOANS . WE SAW HISTORIC DECLINES IN CHILD POVERTY , FAMILY INCOMES UP ON AVERAGE MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD , AND MANY AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE MIDDLE CLASS . SO TODAY WE FACE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGES , SOME OF WHICH WE COULD HAVE NEVER IMAGINED BACK IN THE 1990S . BUT I BELIEVE THE PRINCIPLES THAT UNKNOWNWORD US THEN ARE STILL UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . THESE ARE THE PRINCIPLES THAT ARE TRULY AT THE START OF MY PLAN TO HELP RESTORE OUR ECONOMY . I BELIEVE IN AN OPTIMISTIC , UNKNOWNWORD , MODERN APPROACH TO THE ECONOMY . THERE'S NO LIMITS TO WHAT WE CAN DO IF WE SET OUR MINDS TO IT . AND I BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BEGIN ON DAY ONE TO TURN THE ECONOMY AROUND . I HAVE FOUR UNKNOWNWORD : CREATING NEW JOBS , GOOD JOBS , ESSENTIAL TO BROAD-BASED PROSPERITY ; RESTORING FAIRNESS TO OUR ECONOMY ; RENEWING THE BASIC BARGAIN THAT IF YOU WORK HARD YOU CAN GET HEAD ; AND PUTTING OUR FISCAL HOUSE IN ORDER AGAIN . WE'RE GOING TO ASK EVERYBODY TO PARTICIPATE , BUT I AM NOT GOING TO ASK THE MIDDLE CLASS TO DO MORE THAN IT HAS ALREADY DONE . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION HAS BEEN A MAJOR UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] SO WE'RE GOING TO TAKE AWAY THE TAX SUBSIDIES FROM THE OIL COMPANIES , AND WE'RE GOING TO PUT THOSE TO WORK ON BEHALF OF CLEAN , RENEWABLE , ALTERNATIVE ENERGY . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO FORCE THE PHARMACEUTICAL COMPANIES TO COMPETE . WE'RE GOING TO MAKE THEM HAVE TO NEGOTIATE WITH MEDICARE TO GET THOSE DRUG PRICES DOWN . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO TELL THE HEALTH INSURANCE COMPANIES WHO HAVE DENIED SO MANY PEOPLE COVERAGE THAT THEY WILL NO LONGER BE ABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST THE SICK , AND WE'RE GOING TO UNKNOWNWORD EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN FOR QUALITY , AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE . WE'RE GOING TO FIGHT ANY ILL-ADVISED EFFORT TO UNKNOWNWORD SOCIAL SECURITY . WE'RE GOING TO KEEP SOCIAL SECURITY ROCK UNKNOWNWORD FOR GENERATIONS . AND WE'RE GOING TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR RETIREMENT WITH NEW RETIREMENT ACCOUNTS . [APPLAUSE ] AND WHEN IT COMES TO TRADE , WE'RE GOING TO HAVE REAL , UNKNOWNWORD STANDARDS AND PROTECTIONS FOR OUR WORKERS AND OUR ENVIRONMENT . AND UNLIKE THE CURRENT PRESIDENT , I WILL MAKE TRADE ENFORCEMENT A TOP PRIORITY AGAIN . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO HAVE A MANUFACTURING POLICY , BECAUSE I DON'T BELIEVE WE CAN REMAIN A GREAT COUNTRY WITH A STRONG ECONOMY IF WE DON'T MAKE THINGS IN AMERICA . AND I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON MAKING SURE THAT WE CONTINUE TO DO SO . [APPLAUSE ] WE'RE GOING TO PASS LAWS THAT HELP PEOPLE BE ABLE TO JOIN UNIONS AND BARGAIN COLLECTIVELY FOR GOOD WAGES AND FAIR BENEFITS AGAIN . WE'RE GOING TO FOCUS ON FAMILY FARMS , INSTEAD OF CORPORATE FARMS , AND WE'RE GOING TO GIVE FAMILY FARMS THE SUPPORT AND THE TOOLS THAT THEY NEED TO BE SUCCESSFUL . AND WE ARE GOING TO FINALLY CLOSE THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD AND STOP GIVING TAX BREAKS TO COMPANIES THAT SHIP JOBS OVERSEAS . ENOUGH WITH UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN JOBS USING TAXPAYER DOLLARS . [APPLAUSE ] BUT I'M GOING TO GO FURTHER THAN THAT : I WILL PROVIDE TAX RELIEF FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS , BECAUSE YOU HEARD ME SAY THAT , GIVEN THE INCREASE IN ENERGY PRICES SINCE 2000 , ON AVERAGE $2,000 , THAT IS FAR MORE THAN ANY MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILY GOT OUT OF THESE BUSH TAX CUTS . WE'RE NOT GOING TO BE FOOLED . WE'RE GOING TO GET BACK TO REAL TAX RELIEF FOR MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES . I'LL EXTEND THE MIDDLE-CLASS TAX CUTS , GIVE GENEROUS TAX BREAKS TO HELP FAMILIES AFFORD HEALTH CARE , OFFER UP TO $1,000 IN MATCHING TAX CUTS TO HELP FAMILIES SAVE FOR RETIREMENT . I'LL EXPAND THE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT , INCREASE TAX CREDITS FOR CHILD CARE , AND PROVIDE A NEW $3,500 TAX CREDIT TO HELP MIDDLE-CLASS FAMILIES SEND THEIR CHILDREN TO COLLEGE . [APPLAUSE ] AND I WILL TIE THE MINIMUM WAGE TO CONGRESSIONAL SALARIES SO THAT CONGRESS CAN'T GET A RAISE UNTIL WORKING MEN AND WOMEN GET A RAISE IN THE MINIMUM WAGE . [APPLAUSE ] THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT , BUT THERE ARE THINGS WE SHOULD DO RIGHT NOW , IMMEDIATE ACTION TO FACE THE ECONOMIC CHALLENGES . THAT STARTS WITH STEPS TO PREVENT AS MANY HOUSING FORECLOSURES AS POSSIBLE . I'VE ALREADY ANNOUNCED A SERIES OF POLICIES TO DO JUST THAT , INCLUDING A UNKNOWNWORD BILLION FUND TO HELP STATES WORK WITH AT-RISK HOMEOWNERS TO PREVENT FORECLOSURE . TODAY , I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO CONVENE A CRISIS CONFERENCE , BRINGING TOGETHER ALL THE STAKEHOLDERS IN THE HOUSING CRISIS , FROM LENDERS TO HOMEOWNERS TO COMMUNITY GROUPS , TO FIGURE OUT A SOLUTION TO THE HOUSING CRISIS . THE TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IS OVER . WE NEED URGENT ACTION . AND INSTEAD OF JUST TRYING TO HELP THE BIG BANKS , HOW ABOUT HELPING AMERICA , MR . PRESIDENT , TO DEAL WITH THIS FORECLOSURE CHALLENGE THAT WE'RE FACING ? [APPLAUSE ] SECOND , WE NEED TO IMMEDIATELY ADDRESS THE IMPENDING HOME HEATING CRISIS THAT COULD AFFECT SO MANY FAMILIES THIS YEAR . NOW , THE ONLY LONG-TERM SOLUTION TO HIGH ENERGY PRICES IS REDUCING OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CARBON INTENSITY OF OUR ECONOMY . I'VE OUTLINED A COMPREHENSIVE PLAN TO DO THAT THAT I TALKED ABOUT OUTSIDE OF CEDAR RAPIDS , AT NEWTON , AND OTHER PLACES THROUGHOUT IOWA , AND I HAVE SET GOALS TO BE ABLE TO MOVE TOWARD ACHIEVING THAT . BUT IT'S NOT GOING TO HAPPEN UNTIL WE SEE THE END OF THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION . AND I BELIEVE , IF WE DO IT , WE CAN CREATE FIVE MILLION NEW JOBS . YOU KNOW ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD JOBS AND UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . HOW ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD JOBS FOR PEOPLE WHO ARE GOING TO PUT SOLAR PANELS ON UNKNOWNWORD , DO THE WORK ON BIO-FUELS AND EVERYTHING ELSE ? BUT WITH OIL APPROACHING $100 A BARREL , IT'S GOING TO COST FAMILIES 20 PERCENT TO 25 PERCENT MORE TO HEAT THEIR HOMES THIS WINTER . TOO MANY FAMILIES CAN'T AFFORD THAT . SO I WAS OUTRAGED LAST WEEK WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH VETOED EMERGENCY ENERGY ASSISTANCE FUNDING FOR FAMILIES . BECAUSE OF HIS VETO , STATE AGENCIES RIGHT HERE IN IOWA AND ACROSS AMERICA HAVE BEEN FORCED TO TURN AWAY UNKNOWNWORD FAMILIES . IF PRESIDENT BUSH GETS HIS WAY , ONE MILLION FAMILIES WILL BE CUT OFF FROM HEATING ASSISTANCE THIS WINTER . THAT IS UNCONSCIONABLE . I'VE LIVED IN THE WHITE HOUSE . THEY KEEP IT WARM IN THE WHITE HOUSE . AND MAYBE THE PRESIDENT SHOULD GET OUT OF THE WHITE HOUSE AND COME TO IOWA AND MEET SOME OF THOSE FAMILIES WHO ARE GOING TO GET CUT OFF OF ENERGY ASSISTANCE BECAUSE OF HIS VETO . I CALL ON THE PRESIDENT TO PUT PARTISAN POLITICS ASIDE AND COMMIT EMERGENCY FUNDS TODAY , NOT MONTHS DOWN THE ROAD , WHEN MILLIONS OF SENIORS AND LOW-INCOME FAMILIES HAVE LITERALLY BEEN LEFT OUT IN THE COLD . LET'S ENSURE THAT NO ELIGIBLE FAMILY GETS TURNED AWAY AND THAT ASSISTANCE KEEPS PACE WITH THE RISING ENERGY PRICES . IN ADDITION , WE SHOULD COMMIT UNKNOWNWORD BILLION TO AN EMERGENCY HOME CONSERVATION PROGRAM TO LOWER COSTS FOR FAMILIES IN UNKNOWNWORD STATES . THIS PROGRAM WILL ALLOW STATES TO MAKE WEATHERIZATION UNKNOWNWORD AVAILABLE TO THREE MILLION FAMILIES . THESE UNKNOWNWORD WOULD INCLUDE UNKNOWNWORD ITEMS , LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD , AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR YOUR WATER UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD FOR DOORS AND WINDOWS . WE KNOW FROM EXPERIENCE THIS CAN REDUCE A FAMILY'S HEATING BILL BY UP TO 20 PERCENT . THIRD , WE NEED TO WORK WITH GOVERNMENTS AROUND THE WORLD TO SET UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE THESE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS MORE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU KNOW , HERE IN AMERICA , WE WOULD NEVER FEAR PEOPLE FROM OTHER NATIONS WHO HAVE CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AND WANT TO INVEST AND CREATE JOBS HERE . BUT WHEN THE INVESTOR IS A FOREIGN GOVERNMENT , WE NEED TO BE VIGILANT ABOUT ENSURING THAT THE INVESTMENTS DON'T THREATEN OUR ECONOMIC SOVEREIGNTY . CURRENTLY , THESE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS DON'T HAVE TO DISCLOSE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , THEIR INVESTMENT OBJECTIVES , THEIR INVESTMENT UNKNOWNWORD , OR THEIR MANAGEMENT STRUCTURES , SO IT'S HARD TO UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER THEY'RE INTRODUCING UNNECESSARY RISKS INTO OUR MARKETS , HARD TO KNOW WHETHER THEY'RE BUYING OR SELLING ASSETS TO MAKE A PROFIT OR MAKE A POINT . SO TODAY I CALL ON THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION , THE WORLD BANK , THE INTERNATIONAL MONETARY FUND TO BEGIN IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD TRANSPARENCY UNKNOWNWORD FOR THESE SOVEREIGN WEALTH FUNDS . UNKNOWNWORD DISCLOSURE REQUIREMENTS ARE CRITICAL TO HELP US UNDERSTAND HOW THESE FUNDS ARE OPERATING . AND , FINALLY , WE NEED TO START ADDRESSING THE RISKS POSED BY UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER COMPLEX FINANCIAL PRODUCTS . YOU CAN'T LET WALL STREET SEND THE BILL TO YOUR STREET WITH THE BRIGHT IDEAS THAT JUST DON'T WORK OUT . UNKNOWNWORD AND PRODUCTS LIKE THEM ARE POSING REAL RISKS TO FAMILIES , AS WALL STREET UNKNOWNWORD DOWN TENS OF BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN INVESTMENTS . COMPANIES ARE TAKING THE LOSS OF A BILLION HERE AND A BILLION THERE SIMPLY BECAUSE THE SECURITIES THEY OWN ARE WORTH LESS THAN THEY THOUGHT . SO AS PRESIDENT , I WILL MOVE TO ESTABLISH THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WE NEED IN A UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL MARKETPLACE . I WILL CALL FOR AN IMMEDIATE REVIEW OF THESE NEW INVESTMENT PRODUCTS AND FOR PLANS TO MAKE THEM MORE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I WOULD HOPE THAT THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION WOULD DO IT BEFORE I'M UNKNOWNWORD IN . I DON'T WANT TO SEE ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD MONTHS OF POTENTIAL RISKS BEING UNKNOWNWORD INTO OUR ECONOMY WITH ALL OF THE OTHER FACTORS AT WORK . YOU KNOW , PRESIDENT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT , WHO SAID A LOT OF REALLY SMART THINGS , SAID ECONOMIC LAWS ARE NOT MADE BY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY'RE MADE BY HUMAN BEINGS . NEVER BEFORE HAS AMERICA BEEN AT SUCH AN IMPORTANT ECONOMIC UNKNOWNWORD . THE THREATS TO OUR SUCCESS ARE MANY ; THEY'VE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY MISGUIDED GOVERNMENT POLICIES AND FAILED ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP AND AN EFFORT TO TURN OUR GOVERNMENT INTO A GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW , BY THE FEW , AND FOR THE FEW . BUT , YOU KNOW , AMERICA'S STRENGTHS ARE UNKNOWNWORD , AND I THINK WE'RE READY TO COME TOGETHER AGAIN AND DO WHAT IT TAKES TO SUCCEED . WE JUST NEED A PRESIDENT READY TO CHANGE OUR POLICIES AND LEAD OUR PEOPLE . I BELIEVE I CAN PROVIDE THE ECONOMIC LEADERSHIP WE NEED TO MAKE THE CHANGES THAT ARE SO DESPERATELY REQUIRED , AND I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT AND YOUR COUNSEL AND YOUR HELP AS WE MAKE THIS JOURNEY TOGETHER . THANK YOU ALL VERY , VERY MUCH .
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD EVERYONE . I AM SO SORRY I CAN NOT BE WITH YOU IN PERSON TODAY . BUT I AM PLEASED TO HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO TALK WITH YOU UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON THE FIRST DAY OF YOUR UNKNOWNWORD ANNUAL CONVENTION . I ESPECIALLY WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE EXECUTIVE BOARD FOR THEIR OUTSTANDING LEADERSHIP . AND I'D LIKE TO RECOGNIZE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , ONE OF MY CAMPAIGN UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FOR THEIR TREMENDOUS SUPPORT AND FRIENDSHIP . FINALLY , I WANT TO HONOR ALL OF YOU GATHERED HERE TODAY FOR YOUR LEADERSHIP AND SERVICE IN YOUR NATIONS -- AND FOR YOUR CONTRIBUTIONS TO OUR SHARED FUTURE . YOUR COMMITMENT TO OUR ENVIRONMENT , TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF FAMILY AND COMMUNITY THAT BIND US TO EACH OTHER , TO MAKING DECISIONS BASED NOT ON JUST THEIR IMPACT TODAY -- BUT ON GENERATIONS TO COME -- IS IMPORTANT FOR ALL OF US TO REMEMBER . UNFORTUNATELY , THE UNITED STATES HAS NOT ALWAYS HONORED ITS OBLIGATIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS -- AND UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY STILL FEELS THE EFFECTS EVERY SINGLE DAY . DURING THE PAST SEVEN YEARS , THE SITUATION HAS ONLY GOTTEN WORSE . WE'VE SEEN FUNDING CUTS AND FAILURES TO HONOR TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY . PRESIDENT BUSH HAS UNKNOWNWORD THE TRIBAL GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD POSITION WITHIN THE WHITE HOUSE AND UNKNOWNWORD AFFAIRS OFFICE -- A POSITION STARTED BY MY HUSBAND . FIVE OF THE EIGHT UNKNOWNWORD . ATTORNEYS FIRED BY ATTORNEY GENERAL UNKNOWNWORD WERE LEADERS IN UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . WELL , I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR A NEW BEGINNING . IT'S TIME FOR OUR GOVERNMENT TO WORK TOGETHER AS UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN , LIKE WE USED TO . I'M PROUD OF WHAT WE ACCOMPLISHED TOGETHER DURING THE 1990S . I WAS HONORED TO VISIT UNKNOWNWORD DURING MY TIME AS FIRST LADY AND TO WORK WITH TRIBAL LEADERS TO SUPPORT MY HUSBAND'S INITIATIVE TO TRAIN AND FUND UNKNOWNWORD NEW UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN TEACHERS . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL RESTORE THAT PARTNERSHIP AND RENEW OUR SHARED MISSION TO LIFT UP OUR FAMILIES AND BUILD THE FUTURE OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN AND FUTURE GENERATIONS DESERVE . I WILL START BY FULLY SUPPORTING TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND UNKNOWNWORD THE GOVERNMENT TO GOVERNMENT RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD AND THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT -- NOT JUST WITH TALK , BUT WITH ACTION . I'LL SIGN AN EXECUTIVE ORDER THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR GOVERNMENT TO UNKNOWNWORD AND MEANINGFUL COLLABORATION WITH TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS . AND I WILL ALWAYS HONOR OUR FEDERAL TRUST RESPONSIBILITY -- IT'S NOT JUST A LAW , IT IS A FUNDAMENTAL MORAL OBLIGATION , NOTHING LESS . SECOND , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL APPOINT UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS TO KEY POSITIONS THROUGHOUT THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT . I'LL RESTORE THE SENIOR POSITION IN THE OFFICE OF UNKNOWNWORD AFFAIRS . THIS PERSON WILL SERVE AS MY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN COMMUNITIES . AND I'LL WORK TO APPOINT UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN JUDGES AND OTHERS WHO TRULY UNDERSTAND TRIBAL SOVEREIGNTY AND RESPECT THE NEEDS OF UNKNOWNWORD COMMUNITIES . THIRD , IMPROVING HEALTHCARE IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY WILL BE AT THE TOP OF MY NATIONAL AGENDA . IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT THE AVERAGE LIFE UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD IS NEARLY FIVE YEARS LESS THAN THE REST OF THE POPULATION . IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS ARE MORE THAN FOUR TIMES AS LIKELY TO DIE FROM DIABETES AND MORE THAN 50 % MORE LIKELY TO DIE FROM UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS UNACCEPTABLE THAT WHILE THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT SPENDS NEARLY $6,000 FOR EACH MEDICARE UNKNOWNWORD -- IT SPENDS ONLY $2,000 PER PERSON FOR UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH SERVICE MEDICAL CARE . I WAS PROUD TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE UNKNOWNWORD ACT AMENDMENT . THIS BILL WILL EXPAND COVERAGE FOR QUALIFIED UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS IN THE STATE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM , A PROGRAM I HELPED TO CREATE AS FIRST LADY . IT WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH SERVICES DIRECTOR TO THE UNKNOWNWORD SECRETARY LEVEL . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , UNKNOWNWORD HEALTHCARE WILL BE A NATIONAL PRIORITY ALONG WITH QUALITY , AFFORDABLE CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILY . I WON'T REST UNTIL I GET IT DONE . FOURTH , I WILL WORK EVERY DAY TO ENSURE THAT EVERY CHILD IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY HAS THE CHANCE TO LIVE UP TO HIS OR HER GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL . I'LL START RIGHT AT THE BEGINNING , BY INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD HEAD START PROGRAM . A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD STUDY FROM LAST SEPTEMBER UNKNOWNWORD THAT TRIBAL LANGUAGES ARE THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ENTIRE WORLD . THAT'S ONE OF THE MANY REASONS WHY HEAD START IS CRITICAL . IT PROVIDES A FOUNDATION FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD LANGUAGES AND SUPPORT FOR TRIBAL CULTURES . IN FACT , MORE THAN 80 DIFFERENT LANGUAGES ARE SPOKEN IN UNKNOWNWORD HEAD START PROGRAMS . I'VE ALSO PROPOSED UNIVERSAL PRE-KINDERGARTEN FOR ALL UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN CHILDREN , BECAUSE STUDIES SHOW THAT PROVIDING UNKNOWNWORD OLDS WITH A HIGH-QUALITY EARLY EDUCATION LEADS TO HIGHER ACHIEVEMENT AND UNKNOWNWORD RATES AND UNKNOWNWORD JOBS . I'LL INCREASE SUPPORT FOR TRIBAL COLLEGES AND INSTITUTIONS SERVING UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN STUDENTS . THESE INSTITUTIONS PLAY A CRITICAL ROLE , PROVIDING UNKNOWNWORD TEACHING , COMMUNITY OUTREACH , AND RESEARCH SERVICES TO TRIBAL COMMUNITIES . SO IT'S TIME THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT GAVE THEM THE RESOURCES THEY DESERVE . FIFTH , AS PRESIDENT , I'LL WORK TO IMPROVE HOUSING FOR UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILIES . TODAY , ROUGHLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN FAMILIES ARE HOMELESS OR UNKNOWNWORD , AND AN ESTIMATED UNKNOWNWORD HOUSING UNKNOWNWORD ARE NEEDED IMMEDIATELY IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . SO WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL INVEST IN BUILDING AND UNKNOWNWORD AFFORDABLE HOUSING ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . THAT MEANS BOTH INCREASING FUNDING FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN HOUSING BLOCK GRANT AND MODERNIZING THE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN HOUSING ASSISTANCE AND UNKNOWNWORD ACT . UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL WORK TO SUPPORT ENERGY EFFICIENT DEVELOPMENT IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . I FULLY SUPPORT THE RIGHTS OF TRIBAL GOVERNMENTS TO SHAPE THEIR OWN ENVIRONMENTAL POLICIES . I'LL SUPPORT YOUR EFFORTS BY CREATING AND EXPANDING UNKNOWNWORD PARTNERSHIPS TO PROMOTE SOLAR , WIND , AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY . AS PART OF A NATIONAL WEATHERIZATION INITIATIVE , I'LL WORK TO UNKNOWNWORD EVERY LOW-INCOME HOME IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . LAST WINTER , THE AVERAGE FUEL BILL FOR OUR FAMILIES WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD -- IT'S EXPECTED TO UNKNOWNWORD TO $1,000 THIS WINTER . SO UNKNOWNWORD HOMES IS A UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSITION : GOOD FOR THE ENVIRONMENT AND FOR OUR BUDGETS . SEVENTH , WE NEED A UNKNOWNWORD FOCUS ON LAW ENFORCEMENT EFFORTS ON UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . IT'S SIMPLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WHEN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD ARE TWICE AS LIKELY TO BE VICTIMS OF VIOLENT CRIMES , THERE ARE FEWER THAN HALF AS MANY POLICE ON TRIBAL LANDS AS UNKNOWNWORD LANDS . AND WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD CRISIS AFFECTING SO MANY COMMUNITIES , THE NEED FOR LAW ENFORCEMENT RESOURCES IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY IS GREATER THAN EVER . I'LL START BY IMPROVING THE COLLECTION OF DATA ON CRIME IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . WE CAN'T TRULY FIX THE PROBLEM UNLESS WE TRULY UNDERSTAND IT . I'LL ALSO MAKE THE INVESTMENTS WE NEED TO STEP UP LAW ENFORCEMENT IN UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY AND PROMOTE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AGREEMENTS TO REDUCE CRIME AND KEEP OUR FAMILIES SAFE . FINALLY , ON THIS UNKNOWNWORD OF VETERANS DAY , I WANT YOU TO KNOW THAT AS PRESIDENT , I WILL STAND UP FOR OUR VETERANS EVERY DAY . AS YOU KNOW , UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS HAVE ONE OF THE HIGHEST RATES OF SERVICE OF ANY GROUP IN AMERICA . AT THE END OF THE UNKNOWNWORD CENTURY , WE HAD NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN VETERANS IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE ONE OF THE MOST FUNDAMENTAL OBLIGATIONS OF THE NEXT PRESIDENT IS TO KEEP FAITH WITH THESE VETERANS -- TO PROVIDE THE HEALTHCARE AND BENEFITS THEY'VE EARNED AND THE RESPECT AND GRATITUDE THEY DESERVE . SO I'LL FULLY FUND THE VA , I'LL CUT THE RED UNKNOWNWORD , I'LL CREATE A NEW GI BILL FOR A NEW GENERATION OF VETERANS . I WILL NEVER BACK DOWN AND NEVER STOP FIGHTING FOR THOSE WHO FOUGHT FOR US . IN CLOSING , I WANT AGAIN TO THANK YOU AGAIN FOR GIVING ME THE OPPORTUNITY TO SPEAK WITH YOU TODAY -- IT MEANS A GREAT DEAL TO ME . AND I URGE YOU TO DO EVERYTHING YOU CAN TO MAKE YOUR VOICES HEARD IN THIS ELECTION . YOUR VOTES CAN MAKE THE DIFFERENCE IN ELECTING A PRESIDENT WHO IS A TRUE PARTNER WITH UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRY . IF YOU GIVE ME THE HONOR OF BEING ELECTED , I WILL BE THAT PARTNER . THANK YOU ALL VERY MUCH .
BLUE	THANK YOU . THANK YOU . THANK YOU SO MUCH . THANK YOU IOWA DEMOCRATS . THANK YOU ALL . THANK YOU . WHAT A NIGHT . WHAT A GREAT , GREAT NIGHT . THANK YOU ALL . THERE'S NO BETTER PLACE TO BE THAN RIGHT HERE IN IOWA WITH THE GREAT ELECTED OFFICIALS THAT YOU HAVE : YOUR GOVERNOR , YOUR LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR , YOUR CONGRESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD , OUR WONDERFUL FRIEND , SENATOR TOM HARKIN AND HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD . ISN'T IT A SPECIAL TREAT TO HAVE THE SPEAKER OF THE HOUSE , UNKNOWNWORD SPEAKER HERE TONIGHT ? [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , ON JANUARY 20TH , 2009 , SOMEONE WILL STAND ON THE STEPS OF THE CAPITOL AND RAISE HIS OR HER HAND - [APPLAUSE ] - TO TAKE THE OATH OF OFFICE AS THE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . AND WE ARE HERE TONIGHT TO MAKE SURE THAT THAT NEXT PRESIDENT IS A DEMOCRAT . [APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE , WE KNOW , AFTER SEVEN YEARS OF GEORGE W . BUSH , SEVEN YEARS OF INCOMPETENCE , CRONYISM , AND CORRUPTION , SEVEN YEARS OF A GOVERNMENT OF THE FEW BY THE FEW AND FOR THE FEW . WE , AS A NATION CANNOT AFFORD ANY OTHER CHOICE . WE HAVE TO HAVE A DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT BECAUSE WE HAVE BIG CHALLENGES TO MEET . WE HAVE A WAR TO END . WE HAVE AN ECONOMY TO UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE A 47 MILLION AMERICANS TO UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE AN ENERGY CRISIS TO SOLVE . WE HAVE A HOMELAND TO PROTECT , WE HAVE ALLIANCES TO REBUILD AND WE HAVE A WORLD TO LEAD . SO , WE ARE READY FOR CHANGE . [APPLAUSE ] BUT , YOU KNOW WHAT ? CHANGE , CHANGE IS JUST A WORD IF YOU DO NOT HAVE THE STRENGTH AND EXPERIENCE TO MAKE IT HAPPEN . [APPLAUSE ] WE MUST NOMINATE A NOMINEE WHO HAS BEEN TESTED , AND ELECT A PRESIDENT WHO IS READY TO LEAD ON DAY ONE . [APPLAUSE ] I KNOW WHAT IT IS GOING TO TAKE TO WIN . I KNOW IT'S GOING TO TAKE ALL OF US AND MILLIONS MORE AND A CANDIDATE WHO WILL WORK AND FIGHT EVERY SINGLE DAY FOR THE NEXT YEAR AND THEN WILL GO INTO THE WHITE HOUSE DETERMINED TO BRING ABOUT THAT CHANGE THAT WE CARE SO MUCH ABOUT . FORTUNATELY , I HAVE A LITTLE EXPERIENCE STANDING UP AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE IS RIGHT AND WHAT I THINK AMERICA NEEDS AND HOW WE CAN GET THERE TOGETHER . [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE SPENT 35 YEARS MAKING A DIFFERENCE AND FIGHTING FOR WHAT I BELIEVE MATTERS TO PEOPLE . AS A YOUNG LAWYER , I WENT TO WORK FOR THE CHILDREN'S DEFENSE FUND , FIGHTING FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND NEGLECTED KIDS , FIGHTING FOR KIDS IN THE FOSTER CARE SYSTEM , FIGHTING FOR KIDS WITH DISABILITIES , KIDS WITHOUT HEALTH CARE , KIDS WITHOUT EDUCATIONAL OPPORTUNITIES . IN ARKANSAS , I HELPED TO EXPAND HEALTH CARE INTO RURAL AREAS AND TO REFORM THE SCHOOL SYSTEM SO THAT EVERY CHILD WOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CONTINUE THOSE FIGHTS . CONTINUE SO THAT WE LEAVE NO PERSON AND NO CHILD OUT OF AMERICA'S PROMISE . AS FIRST LADY , I FOUGHT MY HEART OUT FOR HEALTH CARE , AND , WELL - [APPLAUSE ] - WE MIGHT NOT HAVE BEEN SUCCESSFUL THAT TIME , BUT I AM SO PROUD THAT I PLAYED A PART HELPING TO CREATE THE CHILDREN'S HEALTH INSURANCE PROGRAM AND TO UNKNOWNWORD 6 MILLION CHILDREN . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE ARE GOING TO FINISH THE JOB AND PROVIDE QUALITY AFFORDABLE HEALTH CARE FOR EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN MAN , WOMAN , AND CHILD . [APPLAUSE ] AND , AS SENATOR , I HAVE CONTINUED TO FIGHT FOR FAMILY FARMERS AND FOR WORKERS . TO FIGHT FOR SOLDIERS TO GET THE BODY UNKNOWNWORD THEY NEEDED , AND FOR FIRST UNKNOWNWORD TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THEY REQUIRED AFTER 9/11 . I HAVE FOUGHT AGAINST THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SOCIAL SECURITY AND AGAINST THE FAILED POLICIES OF GEORGE W . BUSH AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . [APPLAUSE ] AND , WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , I WILL WORK TO REVERSE THE DAMAGE OF THE EIGHT YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH AND I WILL RESTORE THE PRIDE AND PROGRESS IN AMERICA THAT SHOULD BE OUR BIRTHRIGHT . THAT IS WHO AMERICA IS . WE WANT TO BE PROUD AGAIN . WE WANT TO BE UNKNOWNWORD AGAIN AND WE WILL , WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY THAT THEY DO NOT KNOW WHERE I STAND . WELL , I THINK YOU KNOW BETTER THAN THAT . I STAND WHERE I HAVE STOOD FOR 35 YEARS . I STAND WITH YOU AND WITH YOUR CHILDREN , AND WITH EVERY AMERICAN WHO NEEDS A UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR CORNER FOR A BETTER LIFE . NOW , I KNOW HOW EASY IT IS IN A CAMPAIGN TO GET UNKNOWNWORD ; TO FOCUS ON WHO IS UP AND WHO IS DOWN , AND WHO SAYS WHAT ABOUT WHOM . BUT , THAT IS NOT WHAT THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THOSE IOWANS AND THOSE AMERICANS WHO FEEL INVISIBLE IN THEIR OWN COUNTRY ; WHO FEEL INVISIBLE TO THEIR OWN PRESIDENT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE WOMAN I MET IN UNKNOWNWORD . SHE AND HER HUSBAND BOTH WORK REALLY HARD , BUT THEY HAD TO SELL HALF THE FAMILY FARM TO PAY THEIR MEDICAL EXPENSES . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT A VETERAN I MET IN SIOUX CENTER , WHO BRAVELY FOUGHT IN IRAQ AND CAME HOME AND HAD TO KEEP FIGHTING TO GET THE HEALTH CARE THAT HE NEEDED . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT THE MOTHER FROM UNKNOWNWORD , WHOSE DAUGHTER GOT SICK AND THEY DID NOT HAVE INSURANCE , AND SHE DIED . AND ON HER DEATH UNKNOWNWORD , THEY COULD NOT EVEN PUT A CAUSE OF DEATH , BECAUSE NOBODY HAD EVER MADE A DIAGNOSIS . SHE WAS JUST UNKNOWNWORD OLD . THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY INVISIBLE AMERICANS AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL NOT BE . WE WILL HAVE A PRESIDENT AGAIN , WHO GETS UP EVERY DAY , WORRIES ABOUT , THINKS ABOUT , AND FIGHTS FOR EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US . THAT'S WHAT AMERICA DESERVES , AND THAT IS WHAT MY CANDIDACY OFFERS . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , WE ARE GETTING CLOSER TO THE IOWA CAUCUSES . THEY ARE GOING TO BE EARLIER THAN EVER BEFORE . I KNOW AS THE CAMPAIGN GOES ON , THAT IT'S GOING TO GET A LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD OUT THERE . BUT THAT IS FINE WITH ME . BECAUSE , YOU KNOW , AS HARRY TRUMAN SAID , IF YOU CAN'T STAND THE HEAT , GET OUT OF THE KITCHEN . I'LL TELL YOU WHAT , I FEEL REALLY COMFORTABLE IN THE KITCHEN . [APPLAUSE ] SO , WE HAVE TO ASK OURSELVES , WHAT IS THIS ELECTION GOING TO BE FOCUSED ON ? WELL , I WILL TELL YOU WHAT I WANT TO DO . I AM NOT INTERESTED IN UNKNOWNWORD MY OPPONENTS . I AM INTERESTED IN UNKNOWNWORD THE PROBLEMS OF AMERICA , AND I BELIEVE -- [APPLAUSE ] -- WE SHOULD BE TURNING UP THE HEAT ON THE REPUBLICANS ; THEY DESERVE ALL THE HEAT WE CAN GIVE THEM . [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , YOU LISTEN TO THE REPUBLICANS WHO ARE RUNNING THIS YEAR , THEY SEE EIGHT MORE YEARS OF GEORGE BUSH . THEY SEE A NINE TRILLION DOLLAR DEBT AND SAY LET'S SPEND UNKNOWNWORD MORE . THEY SEE THAT WE HAD ONE UNKNOWNWORD TO WAR AND THEN SAY , WAIT , WAIT , WHY HAVE ONE MORE ? WELL , I THINK WE ARE GOING TO TELL THEM , IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , THAT THEY DO NOT HAVE ANY MORE TIME . AMERICA IS DONE WITH THE REPUBLICANS AND THEIR FAILED POLICIES AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO GIVE AMERICA BACK THE FUTURE THAT WE DESERVE . BUT WE DEMOCRATS , WE HAVE TO DECIDE WHAT WE ARE FOR . WE DEMOCRATS BELIEVE THAT THE MIDDLE CLASS IS THE BACKBONE OF OUR COUNTRY AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE AMERICAN DREAM . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STAND BY AND WATCH RISING GAS PRICES AND RISING HEALTH CARE COSTS AND INCREASE IN COLLEGE TUITION AND FALLING HOUSING PRICES , AND STRUGGLING FAMILIES , AND THEY HAVE TURNED CHINA INTO OUR UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT ARE WE GOING TO DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE THAT EVERY CHILD HAS A GOD-GIVEN POTENTIAL THAT WE WANT TO HELP UNKNOWNWORD . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS CUT HEAD START , AND REFUSE TO FIX NO CHILD LEFT BEHIND ? WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WHEN WE DEMOCRATS FIGHT FOR UNIVERSAL HEALTH CARE AND THE REPUBLICANS VETO HEALTH CARE FOR CHILD AND THE LET THE INSURANCE COMPANIES AND THE DRUG COMPANIES UNKNOWNWORD HEALTH CARE FOR THE REST OF US , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN LABOR RIGHTS AND WOMEN'S RIGHTS AND GAY RIGHTS , AND CIVIL RIGHTS . [APPLAUSE ] AND WE BELIEVE IN A DEPARTMENT OF LABOR THAT IS ACTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD LABOR , AND A DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE THAT UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TRIED TO TURN THE UNKNOWNWORD BACK ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS , WHEN THEY TRIED TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT LABOR UNIONS , WHEN THEY TRY TO UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL RIGHTS , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN PROTECTING THE ENVIRONMENT AND WE BELIEVE IN SOLVING THE ENERGY CRISIS . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS TURN OVER OUR ENERGY POLICY TO THE OIL COMPANIES AND DENY GLOBAL WARMING , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR ALL AMERICANS AGAIN . WE ACTUALLY BELIEVE IN APPOINTING QUALIFIED PEOPLE TO DO THE JOBS IN THE UNITED STATES GOVERNMENT . SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS STOCK THE GOVERNMENT WITH THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN THEY GIVE NO-BID CONTRACTS TO UNKNOWNWORD AND LEGAL UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND WE DEMOCRATS , WE BELIEVE IN THE POWER OF SCIENCE AND INNOVATION . WE KNOW IT CAN LIFT UP LIVES AND GROW THE ECONOMY , SO WHEN PRESIDENT BUSH UNKNOWNWORD A WAR ON SCIENCE , WHEN HE BANS STEM CELL RESEARCH , WHEN HE TRIES TO TURN WASHINGTON INTO AN EVIDENCE FREE ZONE AND PUT IDEOLOGY IN FRONT OF FACTS . WHAT DO WE DO ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! AND FINALLY , WE BELIEVE THAT OUR COUNTRY IS BOTH GREAT AND GOOD . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL END THE WAR IN IRAQ , END THE ERA OF COWBOY DIPLOMACY AND RESTORE AMERICA'S STANDING AND LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD . [APPLAUSE ] SO , WHEN THE REPUBLICANS ENGAGE IN FEAR-MONGERING AND SABER-RATTLING AND TALK ABOUT WORLD WAR UNKNOWNWORD , WHAT DO WE DO TO THEM ? TURN UP THE HEAT ! WELL , THAT IS WHAT IT'S GOING TO TAKE . WE ARE GOING TO TURN UP THE HEAT ON THE REPUBLICANS AND WE ARE GOING TO TURN AMERICA AROUND . BUT , WE CANNOT DO IT IF WE ARE NOT UNITED AND TOGETHER ; NOT ONLY DEMOCRATS , BUT INDEPENDENTS , AND EVEN REPUBLICANS WHO REJECT THIS RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD IN EXTREMISM . I KNOW WE CAN WIN THIS ELECTION AND I KNOW WE DON'T HAVE A CHOICE . I AM PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY DEMOCRATS AND DEMOCRATIC LEADERS FROM ACROSS AMERICA . AND I AM ESPECIALLY PROUD TO HAVE THE SUPPORT OF SO MANY DEMOCRATIC LEADERS FROM THE SO - CALLED RED STATES TO KNOW THAT I CAN WIN . LEADERS LIKE THE GOVERNOR UNKNOWNWORD OF ARKANSAS AND SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND GOVERNOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHO IS HERE WITH ME TONIGHT . [APPLAUSE ] BECAUSE , DEMOCRATS KNOW , WHEN WE WIN UNKNOWNWORD , WE WIN THE WHITE HOUSE . [APPLAUSE ] I AM SO GRATEFUL TO ALL OF THE IOWANS WHO ARE SUPPORTING ME AND I ABSOLUTELY APPRECIATE EVERYTHING YOU HAVE DONE FOR ME AND FOR ALL OF THE CANDIDATES THROUGHOUT THE CAMPAIGN . I ASK ALL OF YOU TO JOIN MY CAMPAIGN . I ASK YOU TO GO AND STAND FOR ME IN THE CAUCUS ON JANUARY 3 . IF YOU WILL STAND FOR ME FOR A NIGHT , I WILL STAND AND FIGHT FOR YOU EVERY DAY IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND EVERY DAY IN THE WHITE HOUSE . BECAUSE TOGETHER , WE ARE GOING TO RESTORE AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP , REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE-CLASS , REFORM THE GOVERNMENT AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . LET'S DO IT , IOWA DEMOCRATS . LET'S MAKE SURE THAT WE TURN UP THE HEAT AND TURN AMERICA AROUND . THANK YOU AND GOD BLESS YOU .
BLUE	THANK YOU ALL SO MUCH . THANK YOU SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD . THANK YOU ALL FOR BEING HERE . THIS IS SUCH AN EXCITING DAY BECAUSE WE ARE IN THIS FACILITY BEING PART OF THE FUTURE THAT WE WILL MAKE TOGETHER FOR OUR COUNTRY . I WANT TO THANK SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE , HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD ON RENEWABLE ENERGY , HE'S UNKNOWNWORD ON THE FUTURE WE NEED FOR OUR CHILDREN . AND I'M THRILLED TO HAVE SO MANY OTHERS HERE WITH ME TODAY . I WANT TO THANK COUNTY UNKNOWNWORD JIM UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD LABOR COUNCIL . I WANT TO THANK STATE REPRESENTATIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I WANT TO THANK STATE REPRESENTATIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WANT TO THANK MY DEAR FRIEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO'S WITH ME AND I WANT TO ESPECIALLY THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OTHER PEOPLE ARE TALKING AND YOU'RE DOING . YOU'RE MAKING IT HAPPEN . [APPLAUSE ] I HAVE BEEN LOOKING FORWARD TO BEING HERE BECAUSE I KNOW HOW IMPORTANT IT IS THAT THOSE OF US WHO ARE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT , ASKING THE GOOD PEOPLE OF IOWA FOR YOUR SUPPORT , THAT WE TELL YOU WHAT WE WILL DO WHEN WE'RE PRESIDENT TO DEAL WITH THE BIG PROBLEMS FACING AMERICA . AND TODAY I WANT TO FOCUS ON ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE . TWO YEARS AGO AS PART OF A BIPARTISAN CONGRESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD , I TRAVELED TO UNKNOWNWORD , ALASKA . THAT'S THE NORTHERN MOST POINT OF THE UNITED STATES . AND I ALSO TRAVELED THROUGH ON MY WAY THERE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN CANADA . TRAVELING OVER THOSE VAST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT BLANKET THOSE HARSH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I LOOKED DOWN TO SEE DEAD UNKNOWNWORD AS FAR AS THE EYE COULD REACH . THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE PART OF AN UNKNOWNWORD FORMED TO SURVIVE BRUTAL CONDITIONS . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , SOME CENTURIES OLD , ARE NO MATCH FOR A RELATIVE UNKNOWNWORD : A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD KNOWN AS THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD , IT TURNS OUT , WERE ONCE PROTECTED BY COLD , COLD UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD COULD NOT SURVIVE . BUT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAVE ALLOWED THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO TRAVEL INTO HIGHER UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IN ONCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THERE WAS UNKNOWNWORD . MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WHOLE UNKNOWNWORD OF LAND - ONCE GREEN - NOW BROWN . WHEN WE ARRIVED IN UNKNOWNWORD , VIRTUALLY EVERYONE I SPOKE TO HAD A PERSONAL WAKE UP CALL ABOUT WHAT WAS HAPPENING IN THE CLIMATE . A VISIT TO A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HOLE UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD UP UNKNOWNWORD . A UNKNOWNWORD VILLAGE UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . I MET UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD RACES WHO TOLD ME THEY NO LONGER EVEN NEEDED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING THOSE RACES . AT THE TOP OF THE WORLD , YOU HEAR STORIES -- UNKNOWNWORD BY DECADES OF UNKNOWNWORD INVESTIGATION -- OF CHANGING WEATHER PATTERNS , UNKNOWNWORD ICE , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNPRECEDENTED UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . YOU CAN SEE THE EVIDENCE WITH YOUR OWN EYES . THERE ARE NO CLIMATE CHANGE UNKNOWNWORD INSIDE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . OF COURSE , THIS IS A STORY ABOUT A PLACE THOUSANDS OF MILES FROM HERE , IN ONE OF THE MOST UNKNOWNWORD REGIONS OF OUR PLANET . BUT I SHARE IT BECAUSE IT IS NOT AN UNKNOWNWORD EXPERIENCE ANY LONGER . IT IS A PART OF OUR STORY . IT IS PART OF IOWA'S STORY AND AMERICA'S STORY . ALARMING CLIMATE CHANGES , A STAGNANT ECONOMY , OUR HEALTH WEAKENED , OUR NATIONAL SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD -- BECAUSE OF OUR FAILURE TO MOVE TO A CLEAN , EFFICIENT ENERGY FUTURE . IT IS OUR STORY BECAUSE THE CLIMATE CRISIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CHANGES TO OUR WAY OF LIFE . THE LAST TWO DECADES OF THE 20TH CENTURY WERE THE UNKNOWNWORD IN 400 YEARS . THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE FOUND THAT 11 OF THE PAST 12 YEARS ARE AMONG THE UNKNOWNWORD SINCE UNKNOWNWORD . RISING UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS ALONG THE UNKNOWNWORD UNITED STATES COULD COST UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN THE COMING DECADES . BEYOND OUR SHORES , YOU HAVE AFRICAN COUNTRIES UNKNOWNWORD WATER STRESS , ASIAN COUNTRIES UNKNOWNWORD WITH INCREASING UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S OUR STORY BECAUSE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL THREATENS OUR ECONOMY . AMERICA'S NATIONAL AND ECONOMIC SECURITY HAS TAKEN A UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . GAS PRICES HAVE DOUBLED OVER THE PAST SIX YEARS . NATIONWIDE , UNKNOWNWORD RECENTLY HIT AN ALL-TIME HIGH . YOU KNOW GASOLINE PRICES , UNKNOWNWORD UPON WHERE YOU SHOP , ARE AROUND $3 A UNKNOWNWORD . TWO UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICANS NOW SAY THAT RISING GAS PRICES ARE A HARDSHIP FOR THEIR FAMILIES . ONE IN FOUR LOW INCOME FAMILIES HAVE ALREADY MISSED A MORTGAGE OR A UNKNOWNWORD PAYMENT BECAUSE OF RISING ENERGY COSTS . MEANWHILE , WE ARE MORE DEPENDENT ON FOREIGN OIL TODAY THAN WE WERE ON 9/11 . AND ONE THIRD OF OUR TRADE DEFICIT IS THE PETROLEUM WE UNKNOWNWORD , AS WE TRANSFER MASSIVE UNKNOWNWORD OF WEALTH TO UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENTS THAT USE THOSE FUNDS TO STIFLE OPPOSITION AND FINANCE EXTREMISM . IT'S OUR STORY BECAUSE THE CARBON ECONOMY UNKNOWNWORD OUR HEALTH , THE AIR WE BREATHE , AND THE ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE RAISE OUR CHILDREN . ONE STUDY FOUND THAT POLLUTION FROM POWER PLANTS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR COUNTRY EACH YEAR . NEARLY A THIRD OF OUR CHILDHOOD UNKNOWNWORD CASES ARE CAUSED BY AIR POLLUTION AND ENVIRONMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND FINALLY , IT'S OUR STORY BECAUSE THE PRESIDENT HAS UNKNOWNWORD UNDERMINED OUR PATH TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD EVIDENCE , THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS LAUNCHED A WAR ON SCIENCE ITSELF . POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD STUDIES ON GLOBAL WARMING , UNKNOWNWORD CLIMATE EXPERTS . UNKNOWNWORD TO A UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNION OF CONCERNED SCIENTISTS , NEARLY THREE UNKNOWNWORD OF CLIMATE EXPERTS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN CLIMATE RESEARCH . AND JUST THIS PAST MARCH , THE ADMINISTRATION ISSUED A UNKNOWNWORD ORDER TO EMPLOYEES OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND WILDLIFE SERVICE UNKNOWNWORD THEM TO SPEAK ABOUT THE PLIGHT OF UNKNOWNWORD BEARS WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OFFICIAL UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF AN ALL OUT OPTIMISTIC UNKNOWNWORD ON THE PROBLEM , THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION LAUNCHED AN UNKNOWNWORD ON THE PROBLEM SOLVERS . THE PRESIDENT TOOK SEVEN YEARS TO RECOGNIZE CLIMATE CHANGE . HE REFUSED REALLY TO ENGAGE IN TALKS WITH OTHER GLOBAL LEADERS AT THE UNITED NATIONS AND EVEN TRIED TO STOP INDIVIDUAL STATES FROM TAKING THEIR OWN ACTION TO REDUCE UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS UNDER THE CLEAN AIR ACT . THIS IS THE BIGGEST CHALLENGE WE HAVE FACED IN A GENERATION . IT IS A CHALLENGE TO OUR ECONOMY , TO OUR SECURITY , TO OUR HEALTH , AND TO OUR PLANET . AND IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO MEET IT . IT IS TIME TO GET BACK INTO THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS . AND THAT IS WHAT AMERICA DOES BETTER THAN ANYBODY ELSE . [APPLAUSE ] YOU KNOW , WHEN AMERICA CONFRONTED A GREAT DEPRESSION , WE DID NOT WRING OUR HANDS . WE UNKNOWNWORD UP OUR SLEEVES . TRY ROLLING UP YOUR SLEEVES WHILE YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD YOUR HANDS . IT CAN'T BE DONE . AND WE CREATED THE NEW DEAL AND INVENTED SOCIAL SECURITY . WHEN THE GREATEST GENERATION WAS CALLED UPON TO SAVE THE WORLD FROM TYRANNY IN WORLD WAR II , OUR WHOLE COUNTRY RESPONDED . WHILE YOUNG MEN FOUGHT OVERSEAS , AMERICANS DID THEIR PART TO SUPPORT THE WAR EFFORT HERE AT HOME . WHEN THE SOVIET UNION LAUNCHED UNKNOWNWORD , WE DIDN'T UNKNOWNWORD THE CHALLENGE OR UNKNOWNWORD THE SCIENTISTS WHO WANTED TO GET OUT AND MEET IT . INSTEAD , WITHIN ONE YEAR , PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD HAD CREATED THE DEFENSE ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY , CREATED UNKNOWNWORD , AND PASSED THE NATIONAL DEFENSE EDUCATION ACT THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE NEXT GENERATION OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS . OUR NATION WAS SO UNITED AND DETERMINED THAT WE ANSWERED PRESIDENT KENNEDY'S CALL TO LAND AN AMERICAN ON THE MOON AND RETURN HIM SAFELY TO EARTH WITHIN THE DECADE . FOR THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS , CLIMATE CHANGE IS OUR SPACE RACE . IT IS OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DURING WORLD WAR II AND IT IS OUR RESPONSE TO THE GREAT DEPRESSION . UNKNOWNWORD TO STUDIES , THE NEGATIVE ECONOMIC CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE WILL AFFECT EVERY PART OF OUR COUNTRY , VIRTUALLY EVERY SECTOR OF OUR ECONOMY , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR LOCAL GOVERNMENTS , COST JOBS , AND UNKNOWNWORD A HORRIFIC HUMAN UNKNOWNWORD . I'M VERY PROUD THAT VICE PRESIDENT GORE AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON CLIMATE CHANGE JUST WON THE NOBEL PEACE UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL OF US MUST RESPOND TO . [APPLAUSE ] THERE ARE ALSO SECURITY IMPLICATIONS . A GROUP OF RETIRED 3 AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ISSUED A RECENT UNKNOWNWORD DESCRIBING IN UNKNOWNWORD THE THREAT THAT GLOBAL WARMING POSES TO OUR NATIONAL SECURITY , FROM INCREASED CONFLICT OVER NATURAL RESOURCES TO UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . EARLIER THIS YEAR , THE SENATE PASSED MY LEGISLATION TO REQUIRE THE DEPARTMENT OF DEFENSE TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS ISSUE INTO OUR PLANNING . AND FOR THOSE WHO STILL BELIEVE THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO TACKLE CLIMATE CHANGE , THE PRICE OF INACTION IS FAR HIGHER THAN THE PRICE OF ACTION . I BELIEVE AMERICA IS READY TO TAKE ACTION , TO BREAK THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE OLD ENERGY ECONOMY , TO PROVE THAT THE CLIMATE CRISIS IS ONE OF THE GREAT ECONOMIC OPPORTUNITIES IN THE HISTORY OF OUR COUNTRY . UNKNOWNWORD IT WILL UNLEASH A UNKNOWNWORD OF INNOVATION , CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS , ENHANCE OUR SECURITY , AND LEAD THE WORLD IN A REVOLUTION IN HOW WE PRODUCE AND USE ENERGY . IT CAN LITERALLY BE A NEW BEGINNING FOR THE 21ST CENTURY . [APPLAUSE ] AFTER 35 YEARS OF ADVOCACY ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN AND FAMILIES , I BELIEVE SOLVING THE CLIMATE AND ENERGY CRISIS IS CRITICAL TO LEAVING OUR CHILDREN A WORLD AS HEALTHY AND WELCOMING AS THE ONE WE INHERITED . [APPLAUSE ] AFTER EIGHT YEARS IN THE WHITE HOUSE AND SEVEN YEARS IN THE SENATE , I BELIEVE I KNOW HOW TO GET THE JOB DONE . I KNOW THAT A TRUE AMERICAN RESPONSE OFFERS US A WAY NOT JUST TO BRIDGE THE ECONOMIC DIVIDE , BUT TO HEAL THE PARTISAN DIVIDE THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD OUR POLITICS AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR FUTURE . THERE IS SOMETHING FOR EVERYONE TO DO , AND SUCCESS WILL REQUIRE EACH OF US DO OUR PART . SO , IF YOU'RE READY FOR CHANGE , I AM READY TO LEAD . [APPLAUSE ] WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE WILL SET THREE MAJOR ENERGY GOALS FOR AMERICA . ONE , TO REDUCE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS 80 PERCENT FROM UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY 2050 , THE AMOUNT NECESSARY TO AVOID THE MOST DANGEROUS AND DESTRUCTIVE CONSEQUENCES OF CLIMATE CHANGE . [APPLAUSE ] TWO , TO CUT FOREIGN OIL IMPORTS BY TWO UNKNOWNWORD FROM PROJECTED LEVELS BY UNKNOWNWORD TO MOVE AMERICA TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . AND THREE , TO MOVE US FROM A UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY TO AN EFFICIENT , GREEN ECONOMY BY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD INNOVATION IN CLEAN ENERGY AND ENERGY EFFICIENCY . I BELIEVE THAT WILL CREATE AT LEAST FIVE MILLION GOOD NEW JOBS FROM CLEAN ENERGY OVER THE NEXT DECADE . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , HOW WILL WE ACHIEVE THESE GOALS ? WELL , FIRST , AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LEAD A NATIONAL COMMITMENT TO ENERGY EFFICIENCY . THIS IS THE CHEAPEST , UNKNOWNWORD , FASTEST WAY TO REDUCE ENERGY CONSUMPTION AND SAVE ENERGY COSTS , AND TO CREATE GOOD NEW JOBS THAT CANNOT BE OUTSOURCED . THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE CAN REDUCE ENERGY USE IN UNKNOWNWORD BUILDINGS 20 % BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN DO BETTER THAN THAT I BELIEVE . BY SOME UNKNOWNWORD ALL THE FUTURE GROWTH IN ENERGY DEMAND IN NORTH AMERICA , ALL OF IT , COULD BE MET THROUGH INVESTMENTS IN EFFICIENCY ALONE . AND WE KNOW HOW TO DO THIS . SINCE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL NEW DEMAND HAS BEEN MET SIMPLY BY USING ENERGY MORE EFFICIENTLY . OVER THE PAST THREE DECADES , CALIFORNIA HAS HELD ITS ELECTRICITY USE PER PERSON FLAT . IN OTHER WORDS , THERE'S BEEN NO INCREASE IN ELECTRICITY USE PER PERSON IN THE ENTIRE STATE OF CALIFORNIA FOR 30 YEARS . THEY'VE DONE IT THROUGH PRACTICAL STEPS IN CONSERVATION AND EFFICIENCY . DURING THE SAME 30 YEAR PERIOD , ENERGY DEMAND IN THE REST OF COUNTRY , UNKNOWNWORD BY 50 UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FLAT . WE'VE ALL GONE UP 50 UNKNOWNWORD NOW , DID CALIFORNIA GET LEFT BEHIND ? DID PEOPLE UNKNOWNWORD CALIFORNIA BECAUSE IT WAS NO LONGER A GOOD PLACE TO LIVE ? JUST THE OPPOSITE . IT HAS PROSPERED . A STUDY RELEASED EARLIER THIS YEAR BY THE UNIVERSITY OF CALIFORNIA UNKNOWNWORD FOUND THAT CUTTING GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY UNKNOWNWORD , THROUGH FURTHER IMPROVEMENTS IN EFFICIENCY , COULD CREATE MORE THAN 1 MILLION NEW JOBS IN CALIFORNIA ALONE . AND IF AMERICAN ELECTRICITY USE HAD FALLEN AT THE SAME RATE AS CALIFORNIA USE , OUR WHOLE COUNTRY WOULD BE USING UNKNOWNWORD % LESS ELECTRICITY TODAY . SO WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , INCREASING ENERGY EFFICIENCY QUICKLY WILL BE PRIORITY ONE . WE WILL SET A GOAL OF REDUCING ELECTRICITY DEMANDS 20 % BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE MUST CHANGE THE WAY UTILITIES MAKE MONEY . TODAY THE INCENTIVES ARE BACKWARDS . THE LESS WE CONSERVE , THE MORE CARBON WE UNKNOWNWORD , THE MORE MONEY UTILITIES EARN . WE'LL CHANGE THAT WITH ENERGY EFFICIENCY TARGETS FOR UTILITIES AND INCENTIVES FOR SAVING POWER INSTEAD OF GENERATING MORE OF IT . THIS SEEMINGLY SIMPLE CHANGE , CALLED UNKNOWNWORD , HAS TRANSFORMATIONAL POTENTIAL BECAUSE UTILITIES ARE IN THE BEST POSITION TO HELP BUSINESSES AND FAMILIES MAKE INVESTMENTS IN EFFICIENCY . UNKNOWNWORD STATES ALREADY HAVE SOME FORM OF EFFICIENCY GOALS FOR UTILITIES AND MORE UTILITIES ARE EMBRACING THAT AS WELL . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A UTILITY TO INVEST IN EFFICIENCY . UNKNOWNWORD POWER AND OTHER UTILITIES HAVE COMMITTED TO GO BEYOND THAT . THEY ARE OFFERING ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD TO ALL OF THEIR CUSTOMERS . THEY'RE HELPING THEIR CUSTOMERS COME UP WITH PLANS TO CUT CONSUMPTION AND TO FINANCE THE UNKNOWNWORD OVER 20 TO 30 YEARS , AS IF EFFICIENCY GAINS WERE UNKNOWNWORD PLANTS . IT WORKS LIKE THIS : THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SOLAR POWER AND COLD RESISTANT GLASS AND OTHER IMPROVEMENTS CUT YOUR UTILITY BILL 30 UNKNOWNWORD THE UTILITY PAYS THE UNKNOWNWORD COST OF THOSE IMPROVEMENTS AND THEN A PORTION OF THE EFFICIENCY SAVINGS GOES TO YOU TO CUT YOUR BILLS , AND THE OTHER GOES TO THE UTILITIES TO PAY OFF THE COST OF THE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU GET A LOWER UTILITY BILL , THEY GET MORE POWER WITH NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS . IN THE PROCESS A LOT OF JOBS ARE CREATED - INSTALLING THE NEW PRODUCT , MANUFACTURING , UNKNOWNWORD AND SELLING . THE SYSTEM IS UNKNOWNWORD FRIENDLY , FASTER , CHEAPER AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN BUILDING A NEW POWER PLANT . A LOT OF PEOPLE WHO BUILD THINGS FOR A LIVING , SAY 'WELL , BUT IF WE DON'T KEEP BUILDING POWER PLANTS , WE'RE GOING TO LOSE JOBS .' IT'S JUST THE CONTRARY . IF WE'RE BUILDING MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD PLANTS WE'RE GOING TO CREATE MORE JOBS . THAT'S WHAT I WANT TO SEE FOR US . ONCE WE HAVE NATIONWIDE UNKNOWNWORD , EVERY UTILITY SHOULD IMPLEMENT THIS TYPE OF SYSTEM AND UNKNOWNWORD EFFICIENCY BEFORE BUILDING ANY NEW POWER PLANTS . AND THAT'S JUST THE BEGINNING . AT YOUR OFFICE , YOU PROBABLY HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD COMPUTER , A THOUSAND TIMES MORE POWERFUL AND HALF THE PRICE THAN COMPUTERS AVAILABLE 20 YEARS AGO . AN UNKNOWNWORD CAN HOLD MORE UNKNOWNWORD THAN YOU CAN LISTEN TO IN A MONTH . WE CAN TALK TO ANYONE , ANYWHERE , AT ANY TIME USING 21ST CENTURY INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY , WHICH HAS TRANSFORMED OUR ECONOMY . BUT ALL OF THIS DEPENDS ON A POWER GRID ALL BUT UNCHANGED IN HALF A CENTURY . IT IS TIME TO START BUILDING A 21ST CENTURY GRID . RIGHT NOW THE SYSTEM UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . THE ONLY CONNECTION BETWEEN YOUR HOME AND THE GRID IS THE POWER YOU DRAW . BUT WHAT IF WE UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF THE ADVANCES IN INFORMATION TECHNOLOGY ? IMAGINE IF YOU COULD TIME YOUR AIR UNKNOWNWORD , OR YOUR UNKNOWNWORD OR YOU UNKNOWNWORD TO TURN ON WHEN DEMAND FOR POWER WAS LESS AND THE COST LOWER . IMAGINE IF YOU COULD CHARGE YOUR CAR IN YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AT NIGHT , AND SELL POWER BACK TO THE UTILITY WHEN YOUR CAR IS UNKNOWNWORD AT WORK DURING THE HOURS OF UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY DEMAND . IMAGINE IF YOU COULD SELL BACK THE EXCESS POWER YOU GENERATE WITH SOLAR PANELS ON YOUR UNKNOWNWORD . IMAGINE IF THE SYSTEM COULD MANAGE THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE GRID UNKNOWNWORD , CUTTING UNKNOWNWORD DEMAND TO AVOID BROWN UNKNOWNWORD , CONSERVE POWER AND SAVE MONEY . JUST A UNKNOWNWORD % DROP IN UNKNOWNWORD DEMAND WOULD SAVE UNKNOWNWORD BILLION IN ENERGY COSTS OVER 10 YEARS . WE CAN HARNESS THIS TECHNOLOGY . AS PRESIDENT I WILL FUND TEN UNKNOWNWORD GRID CITIES ," PROVIDE SMART GRID TAX INCENTIVES TO UTILITIES AND ENCOURAGE STATE UTILITY UNKNOWNWORD TO PROVIDE INCENTIVES AS WELL . WE WILL ALSO MAKE APPLIANCES MORE EFFICIENT , SAVING CONSUMERS UNKNOWNWORD BILLION BETWEEN NOW AND UNKNOWNWORD . YOU KNOW THE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESSFUL ENERGY STAR PROGRAM PROVIDES VALUABLE INFORMATION TO CONSUMERS ABOUT HOW TO SAVE ENERGY AND SAVE MONEY BY UNKNOWNWORD MORE EFFICIENT PRODUCTS . LET'S TAKE IT FURTHER AND CREATE A CLIMATE STAR INITIATIVE , TO PROVIDE CONSUMERS WITH INFORMATION TO UNKNOWNWORD THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD OF PRODUCTS THAT THEY BUY . WE WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD -- THE TECHNOLOGY THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I THINK UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WOULD SUPPORT THIS IDEA . IN FACT , HE'D PROBABLY BE THERE HELPING US DEVELOP THE UNKNOWNWORD -- FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - THEY MAY LOOK FUNNY - THEY USE A QUARTER THE AMOUNT OF ENERGY AND LAST UNKNOWNWORD TO 10 TIMES LONGER THAN THE TYPICAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE MOVE TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , OR OTHER EQUALLY ENERGY SAVING ALTERNATIVES , WE WILL CUT OUR NATIONAL ELECTRIC BILL BY MORE THAN $10 BILLION OVER JUST 8 YEARS . I ALSO WANT TO LAUNCH A GREEN BUILDING FUND TO INVEST UNKNOWNWORD BILLION PER YEAR INTO ENERGY EFFICIENCY IN PUBLIC BUILDINGS LIKE SCHOOLS , POLICE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND OFFICES . WE'LL HELP 20 MILLION LOW-INCOME FAMILIES MODERNIZE THEIR HOMES TO BE MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT . BUILDINGS ACCOUNT FOR 40 % OF AMERICA'S CARBON EMISSIONS -- AND THERE ARE SO MANY SIMPLE , COST EFFECTIVE STEPS WE CAN TAKE TO REDUCE HEATING BILLS , LIGHT BILLS , SAVE TAXPAYERS ' MONEY , AND CUT POLLUTION . IN THE PROCESS WE CAN CREATE HUNDREDS OF THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS . I WILL ALSO CREATE A PROGRAM CALLED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ," THAT STANDS FOR THE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD MORTGAGE ASSOCIATION . THIS IS A GREAT IDEA THAT VICE PRESIDENT GORE HAS CHAMPIONED . THE EXTRA COST OF THICKER UNKNOWNWORD AND EFFICIENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , FOR EXAMPLE , ARE OFTEN UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD AND BUYERS LOOKING TO SAVE MONEY -- EVEN THOUGH THESE GREEN PRODUCTS ACTUALLY PAY FOR THEMSELVES IN LOWER UTILITY BILLS . CONNIE UNKNOWNWORD WILL MAKE IT EASIER FOR FAMILIES TO SECURE AFFORDABLE LOANS FROM PRIVATE LENDERS TO IMPROVE THE EFFICIENCY IN THEIR OWN HOME . IT'S A WIN FOR THE BANKERS , HOMEBUYERS AND THE PLANET . YESTERDAY NIGHT I WAS AT THE GREAT RIVER MEDICAL CENTER . IT'S IN WEST UNKNOWNWORD , AND I LEARNED IT IS THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT HOSPITAL IN AMERICA . THIS IS HAPPENING IN IOWA RIGHT NOW . IT'S JUST HAPPENING SO UNKNOWNWORD AND ON SUCH AN INDIVIDUAL UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE DON'T REALIZE ALL OF THE BENEFITS THAT WE CAN GET . THE GREAT RIVER MEDICAL CENTER IS POWERED BY THE WORLD'S LARGEST UNKNOWNWORD GEOTHERMAL HEATING AND UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM . I THOUGHT THAT WAS PRETTY UNKNOWNWORD . RIGHT HERE IN IOWA . THE MOST ENERGY EFFICIENT HOSPITAL IN AMERICA . [APPLAUSE ] THE SECOND PIECE OF MY AGENDA ASKS THE NATIONAL GOVERNMENT TO SET THE RULES AND LEAD THE WAY . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL PUT IN PLACE A MARKET-BASED CAP AND TRADE SYSTEM TO REDUCE CARBON POLLUTION . HERE'S HOW IT WILL WORK : THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR 100 % OF THE NATION'S CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS . COMPANIES PURCHASE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD BUT THEY CAN BE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , BOUGHT , AND SOLD . THE MARKET WILL DETERMINE THE COST OF CARBON POLLUTION AND COMPANIES WILL BE REWARDED FOR CUTTING EMISSIONS . IN UNKNOWNWORD WITH EFFICIENCY , FUEL ECONOMY STANDARDS AND OTHER PROPOSALS , THIS SYSTEM WILL ENSURE WE MEET OUR GOAL OF REDUCING OUR CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING BELOW UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS BY 80 UNKNOWNWORD WE KNOW THIS CAN WORK . IT WAS EXACTLY WHAT WE DID IN THE 1990S TO REDUCE ACID RAIN , CUTTING UNKNOWNWORD DIOXIDE EMISSIONS BY 10 MILLION UNKNOWNWORD BELOW 1980 LEVELS . WHILE SETTING DOWN THE RULES , THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL ALSO SET AN EXAMPLE . ALL NEW FEDERAL BUILDINGS DESIGNED AFTER UNKNOWNWORD JANUARY 20 , 2009 , WHEN I BECOME PRESIDENT , WILL HAVE TO BE CARBON UNKNOWNWORD -- THAT IS ZERO EMISSIONS . NO NEW FEDERAL BUILDINGS THAT DON'T MEET THAT STANDARD . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ASK THE DEPARTMENT OF HOUSING AND URBAN DEVELOPMENT TO STRENGTHEN ENERGY EFFICIENCY STANDARDS FOR PUBLIC HOUSING AND DEVELOP MODEL STANDARDS FOR ALL NEW CONSTRUCTION . AND WE WILL MAKE ENERGY EFFICIENCY A CORE MISSION FOR THE GOVERNMENT SERVICES ADMINISTRATION , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD FEDERAL BUILDINGS . I ALSO WANT TO HELP LOCAL GOVERNMENTS GO GREEN . MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD MAYORS HAVE SIGNED A PLEDGE TO CUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD CONTRIBUTION TO CLIMATE CHANGE AND MEET THE STANDARDS SET BY THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THIRD , I WILL ASK AUTOMAKERS TO PLAY A ROLE . TODAY , YOUR CAR MAY HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , A UNKNOWNWORD SYSTEM AND GPS . WE HAVE FRONT AND SIDE IMPACT UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , TECHNOLOGY THAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CHANGES IN ROAD CONDITIONS . HENRY FORD WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL HE UNKNOWNWORD THE HOOD . BECAUSE HE WOULD RECOGNIZE THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE SAME BASIC UNKNOWNWORD THAT HE PUT IN TO THE MODEL T ALMOST A CENTURY AGO . IN FACT , THAT MODEL T GOT BETTER GAS MILEAGE THAN YOUR TYPICAL UNKNOWNWORD DOES TODAY . WE CAN'T CONTINUE THIS . IT'S TIME FOR A CHANGE . FOR TWO DECADES , UNKNOWNWORD . FUEL ECONOMY HAS STAGNATED . CARS AND LIGHT TRUCKS ACCOUNT FOR UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF OIL CONSUMED EVERY DAY IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE AMERICA SHOULD DO WHAT WE DO BEST : LEAD THE INNOVATION RACE . IMAGINE IF OVER THE PAST CENTURY , WE'D ADVANCED AS FAR IN UNKNOWNWORD OUR CARS AS WE HAVE IN KEEPING OUR CARS SAFE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL RAISE THE FUEL EFFICIENCY STANDARDS TO 40 MILES PER UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD AND 55 BY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] THAT WILL SAVE CONSUMERS MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION DOLLARS IN FUEL BILLS EACH YEAR AND SAVE US UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD OF OIL EACH DAY . BUT I'M NOT GOING TO ASK THE AUTO COMPANIES TO DO IT ALONE . I WANT TO BE A PARTNER , A GOOD PARTNER , TO HELP THEM UNKNOWNWORD TO A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . I'LL PROVIDE $20 BILLION IN "GREEN VEHICLE UNKNOWNWORD " TO HELP DOMESTIC AUTOMAKERS RETOOL THEIR OLDER PLANTS TO MANUFACTURE NEW , MORE EFFICIENT CARS AND TRUCKS . WE'VE ALSO GOT TO INVEST MORE IN NEW BATTERIES , UNKNOWNWORD AND OTHER TECHNOLOGIES . I WILL CREATE A TAX CREDIT TO HELP AUTO MAKERS COVER THE LEGACY HEALTH CARE AND RETIREMENT COSTS THEY FACE . NEXT , WE'LL ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION OF PLUG-IN HYBRIDS . THESE ARE VEHICLES THAT CAN BE FILLED UP AT THE GAS STATION AND UNKNOWNWORD UP IN A STANDARD UNKNOWNWORD . A VEHICLE POWERED BY ELECTRICITY UNKNOWNWORD ONE-THIRD LESS GLOBAL WARMING POLLUTION , EVEN IF THE ELECTRICITY COMES FROM COAL . THESE CARS CAN OFFER THE PROMISE OF 100 MILES TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF THE PLUG-IN IS A UNKNOWNWORD VEHICLE RUNNING ON UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL , IT COULD UNKNOWNWORD TRAVEL UNKNOWNWORD MILES FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF GAS CONSUMED . [APPLAUSE ] NOW , THE GOOD NEWS IS , DETROIT IS ALREADY EMBRACING THIS EXISTING TECHNOLOGY . IT IS POISED TO BE A WORLD LEADER . GENERAL MOTORS PLANS TO BRING A PLUG-IN HYBRID TO MARKET IN 2010 , AND FORD IS LOOKING AT UNKNOWNWORD AS WELL . BUT THE PLUG-IN REVOLUTION CAN'T HAPPEN FAST ENOUGH . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL INVEST $2 BILLION IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT TO REDUCE THE COST , IMPROVE THE CAPACITY AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD BATTERIES . I WILL OFFER CONSUMERS A TAX CREDIT OF UP TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD A PLUG-IN HYBRID . AND I WANT TO ADD 100,000 PLUG-IN HYBRIDS TO THE FEDERAL FLEET BY 2015 . AT THE SAME TIME , WE'VE GOT TO INCREASE ACCESS TO PUBLIC TRANSPORTATION . FOR EVERY UNKNOWNWORD YOU TRAVEL ON A UNKNOWNWORD , A BUS OR A TRAIN INSTEAD OF IN A CAR , YOU PRODUCE 95 % LESS CARBON UNKNOWNWORD AND HALF AS MUCH CARBON DIOXIDE . IF WE HAVE CLEAN BUSES , MORE EFFICIENT UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD COULD EVEN BE GREATER . I WANT TO INCREASE FUNDING FOR PUBLIC TRANSIT BY MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION EACH YEAR AND LINK THAT TO SMART POLICIES THAT DISCOURAGE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . FOURTH , WE'LL ASK THE OIL COMPANIES TO DO THEIR PART . I HAVE PROPOSED A $50 BILLION STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND TO INVEST IN THE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OF THE FUTURE . HERE'S HOW WE'LL PAY FOR IT -- BY ENDING THE TAX BREAKS THAT OIL COMPANIES RECEIVE TO MAINTAIN THE EXISTING OIL DEPENDENCE ECONOMY . [APPLAUSE ] OIL IS NOW OVER UNKNOWNWORD A BARREL . A LOT OF FOLKS THINK IT'S GOING TO GET TO OVER $100 A BARREL . THE OIL COMPANIES DON'T NEED YOUR TAX DOLLARS TO HELP THEM . WE'RE GOING TO GIVE THESE COMPANIES THAT HAVE MADE THE HIGHEST PROFITS IN THE HISTORY OF THE WORLD A CHOICE : PAY INTO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND OR INVEST MORE IN RENEWABLE ENERGY . WE CANNOT LET THE MIDDLE CLASS PAY TWICE TO SOLVE THE ENERGY CRISIS , IN HIGHER PRICES AT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND IN UNKNOWNWORD THE LARGEST BURDEN OF UNKNOWNWORD TO A GREEN ECONOMY . A PORTION OF THE OIL COMPANIES ' PROFITS SHOULD ALSO BE USED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL HELP AMERICA THE WORLD'S LEADER IN UNKNOWNWORD THAT TECHNOLOGY . I WILL ALSO REQUIRE OIL COMPANIES AND OTHER MAJOR GASOLINE UNKNOWNWORD TO INSTALL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AT HALF OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN THE NEXT FIVE YEARS AND ALL OF THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN TEN . IT'S TIME FOR THE OIL COMPANIES TO BECOME ENERGY COMPANIES . THAT'S GOOD FOR OUR COUNTRY AND THEY MUST BEGIN TO DO IT . FIFTH , WE WILL SUPPORT THE INNOVATIVE COMPANIES , THE SKILLED WORKERS , THE UNKNOWNWORD ENTREPRENEURS AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHO ARE DRIVING THE NEXT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD . GERMANY , JAPAN AND OTHER COUNTRIES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD US IN THE PRODUCTION OF SOLAR , WIND , GEOTHERMAL AND OTHER VITAL TECHNOLOGIES . WE'VE ALWAYS BEEN THE INNOVATION NATION , AND IT'S TIME FOR US TO LEAD AGAIN . TOMORROW , I WILL BE IN NEWTON UNKNOWNWORD MY ENERGY JOBS AGENDA . BUT WE NEED LOOK NO FURTHER THAN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] IN A FEW SHORT YEARS , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAS SET AN EXAMPLE OF HOW CREATING CLEAN ENERGY CAN CREATE GOOD JOBS . THIS IS A UNKNOWNWORD SQUARE FOOT FACILITY . YOU EMPLOY MORE THAN 250 PEOPLE HELPING TO DEVELOP AND UNKNOWNWORD THE NEXT GENERATION OF WIND TECHNOLOGY . JUST ONE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL BE FUELED BY THESE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS REALLY THE BRAIN OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , CAN POWER UNKNOWNWORD HOMES WITHOUT PRODUCING ANY POLLUTION AT ALL . [APPLAUSE ] AS PRESIDENT , I WILL BE A GOOD PARTNER FOR UNKNOWNWORD AND FOR OTHER COMPANIES AND INNOVATORS WHO ARE NOT ONLY CONTRIBUTING TO THEIR BOTTOM LINE AND CREATING JOBS , BUT I THINK BEING REAL PATRIOTS . THIS IS THE NEW CHALLENGE . WHAT DOES IT MEAN TO BE A PATRIOT FOR AMERICA IN THE 21ST CENTURY ? END OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL AND AN OLD ENERGY SYSTEM THAT UNDERMINES OUR GROWTH AND OUR FUTURE . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ALSO INCREASE THE GOAL FOR BIOFUELS TO 60 BILLION GALLONS BY UNKNOWNWORD , WITH ALMOST HALF OF THAT COMING FROM ADVANCED BIOFUELS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL . WE WILL ACCELERATE THE PRODUCTION OF ADVANCED COAL TECHNOLOGY . COAL CURRENTLY PROVIDES UNKNOWNWORD OUR ELECTRICITY IN AMERICA , BUT IT COMES AT A HIGH PRICE IN GREENHOUSE GASES AND OTHER POLLUTANTS . WE NEED TO ACCELERATE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF TECHNOLOGY THAT CAN SAFELY CAPTURE AND STORE CARBON DIOXIDE EMISSIONS . THAT IS WHY I WILL PROVIDE FUNDING IMMEDIATELY FOR 10 UNKNOWNWORD PROJECTS . AT THE SAME TIME , WE NEED TO STOP BUILDING COAL PLANTS THE WAY WE HAVE IN THE PAST . I WILL REQUIRE UTILITY UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER THE ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD MAKES POSSIBLE CAN MEET EXPECTED DEMAND BEFORE UNKNOWNWORD ANY NEW COAL PLANT . IN ANY EVENT , I WILL REQUIRE ALL NEW COAL PLANTS TO BE BUILT SO THAT CAPTURE AND STORAGE TECHNOLOGY CAN BE ADDED AS SOON AS IT IS AVAILABLE . I WILL STRONGLY SUPPORT A RENEWABLE UNKNOWNWORD STANDARD , WITH 25 % OF ELECTRICITY COMING FROM WIND , SOLAR , AND OTHER RENEWABLE SOURCES BY UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] WE HAVE LOST SO MUCH TIME IN THE LAST YEARS . TODAY AMERICA PRODUCES BETWEEN 2 % AND 3 % OF OUR POWER THROUGH RENEWABLE SOURCES . MEANWHILE , DENMARK PLANS TO MEET ONE HALF OF ITS ENERGY NEEDS WITH WIND BY UNKNOWNWORD . LAST YEAR , GERMANY PRODUCED HALF OF THE WORLD'S SOLAR ELECTRICITY . WHILE THESE COUNTRIES PROVIDE INCENTIVES FOR ENERGY INDEPENDENCE , THEIR COMPANIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD NEW TECHNOLOGIES AROUND THE WORLD , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR ECONOMIES AND CREATING NEW JOBS . IN JUST THE LAST TWO YEARS , THE UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY ADDED UNKNOWNWORD NEW JOBS IN RENEWABLE ENERGY . AS A POINT OF COMPARISON , SINCE WE HAVE ALMOST FOUR TIMES THE POPULATION THEY HAVE ; THEY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD MILLION , WE HAVE A LITTLE OVER UNKNOWNWORD MILLION , WE COULD HAVE ADDED SOME 300,000 GOOD JOBS FROM THE SAME SOURCES IF WE HAD BEEN LEADING THE WAY INSTEAD OF DRAGGING OUR FEET . AND CLEAN ENERGY WILL ALSO IMPROVE BOTH THE HEALTH OF OUR FAMILIES . UNKNOWNWORD RATES ARE SOARING IN PART BECAUSE OF THE WAY WE PRODUCE ENERGY . NO ONE , CAN ANY LONGER , IGNORE THE HEALTH AFFECTS OF UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY . THE INTERNATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD COMMITTEE IS CONSIDERING UNKNOWNWORD SOME EVENTS AT THE 2008 OLYMPICS IN BEIJING DUE TO POOR AIR QUALITY . SO CHINA IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD TO INSTITUTE TOUGHER EMISSIONS STANDARDS TO CLEAN UP THE AIR BEFORE THE GAMES BEGIN . AS PRESIDENT , TO HELP US REACH 25 % BY UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL MAKE THE PRODUCTION TAX CREDIT FOR WIND AND SOLAR PERMANENT . NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO GET AS YOU MOVE FORWARD WITH YOUR PRODUCTION . [APPLAUSE ] I WILL ALSO PROVIDE TAX INCENTIVES FOR HOMES AND BUSINESSES TO INSTALL TECHNOLOGIES , AND ESTABLISH A NATIONAL NET UNKNOWNWORD STANDARD -- SO , FAMILIES AND COMPANIES THAT INSTALL THESE NEW TECHNOLOGIES CAN SELL POWER BACK TO THE GRID FOR A FAIR PRICE ALL OVER THE COUNTRY . THAT HAPPENS IN SOME STATES , BUT IT UNKNOWNWORD AT THE BORDER . WE NEED TO MAKE IT NATIONAL . FINALLY , THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND I'VE PROPOSED WILL DOUBLE INVESTMENT IN ENERGY RESEARCH AND INVEST IN A NEW INITIATIVE CALLED THE ENERGY ADVANCED RESEARCH PROJECTS AGENCY . I WANT TO BRING TOGETHER THE BEST MINDS IN THE PUBLIC AND PRIVATE , AND ACADEMIC UNKNOWNWORD TO THINK OUTSIDE THE UNKNOWNWORD . IF WE HAVE THE BEST MINDS THINKING ABOUT AN ALTERNATIVE TO THE INTERNAL COMBUSTION ENGINE , WHO KNOWS WHAT WE WOULD CREATE ? WE NEED TO BE DOING THIS . THE AGENCY THAT HELPED US WIN THE SPACE RACE , THAT LITERALLY CREATING THE INTERNET , CAN BE THE WAY WE DEAL WITH OUR NEW ENERGY CHALLENGES . AMERICA CAN LEAD THE WORLD'S GREEN REVOLUTION . OUR ENTREPRENEURIAL CAPACITY , OUR CAPITAL MARKETS , OUR RESEARCH INSTITUTIONS AND OUR SKILLED WORKFORCE ARE UNMATCHED . WE ARE THE BEST IN THE WORLD , LET'S START ACTING LIKE WE'RE THE BEST AGAIN . [APPLAUSE UNKNOWNWORD THIS WILL CREATE AT LEAST UNKNOWNWORD MILLION JOBS . YOU'VE HEARD OF WHITE COLLAR JOBS . YOU'VE HEARD OF BLUE COLLAR JOBS . THESE WILL BE NEW "GREEN COLLAR " JOBS ALL ACROSS AMERICA . [APPLAUSE ] THINK ABOUT IT . UNKNOWNWORD LEVEL JOBS UNKNOWNWORD HOUSES AND INSTALLING GREEN UNKNOWNWORD ON BUILDINGS . HIGH-WAGE CONSTRUCTION JOBS MODERNIZING OUR GRID AND BUILDING GREEN BUILDINGS . FARM JOBS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HIGH-TECH UNKNOWNWORD JOBS IN UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL . MANAGEMENT JOBS IN NEW , CLEAN ENERGY COMPANIES . HIGH TECH JOBS DEVELOPING NEW , AFFORDABLE UNKNOWNWORD OF CLEAN ENERGY . AND LAST BUT NOT LEAST , MANUFACTURING JOBS BUILDING WIND UNKNOWNWORD , SOLAR PANELS AND OTHER PRODUCTS , JUST LIKE HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD . [APPLAUSE ] UNKNOWNWORD , SHAPING OUR OWN CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE WILL ENABLE AMERICA TO PLAY AN INDISPENSABLE ROLE IN SHAPING THE WORLD'S CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . WE CAN'T MEET THESE CHALLENGES ALONE . WE COULD BE AS CLEAN AS ALL OF US HOPE TO BE IN 10 , 15 , 20 YEARS , IF OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA ARE UNKNOWNWORD THE ATMOSPHERE , ALL OF THEIR POLLUTION WILL GET UP IN THE WIND CURRENTS AND FALL RIGHT DOWN ON US . WE CAN'T JUST ACT LIKE THE WORLD DOESN'T NEED OUR LEADERSHIP THE WAY WE HAVE FOR THE LAST 6 AND HALF YEARS . OTHER COUNTRIES LIKE CHINA AND INDIA , THEY SEE WE'VE DONE NOTHING . THEY FEEL FREE , THEREFORE , TO DO VERY LITTLE . THAT IS NOT THE WAY WE CAN LEAD . WE HAVE TO PROVE THAT MOVING AWAY FROM A CARBON ECONOMY IS GOOD FOR GROWTH AND LEAD THE WORLD TO A NEW UNKNOWNWORD AGREEMENT TO REDUCE EMISSIONS DRAMATICALLY . THE PRESIDENT'S FAILED UNILATERAL ENERGY POLICY IS A PART OF OUR FAILED UNILATERAL FOREIGN POLICY . IT'S UNKNOWNWORD US OF THE CREDIBILITY AND THE LEVERAGE WE NEED TO SOLVE THE CLIMATE CRISIS . I'LL CHANGE THAT BY LEADING THE PROCESS TO DEVELOP A NEW TREATY TO REPLACE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS SET TO UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . ONE OF THE WORST MESSAGES THE PRESIDENT SENT WAS WHEN HE TOOK OFFICE AND REJECTED UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HE COULD HAVE SAID WE DON'T LIKE UNKNOWNWORD BUT WE'RE IMMEDIATELY STARTING A NEW PROCESS . BUT THAT DIDN'T HAPPEN . WELL , COME JANUARY 2009 , I'M SENDING A DIFFERENT MESSAGE . I WANT TO ACT QUICKLY TO HELP DEVELOP A NEW TREATY . I WILL ENGAGE IN HIGH LEVEL MEETINGS WITH LEADERS AROUND THE WORLD EVERY THREE MONTHS , IF THAT'S WHAT IT TAKES TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT A NEW AGREEMENT . MY GOAL WILL BE TO SECURE A DEAL BY 2010 . WE CAN'T WAIT FOR TWO MORE YEARS . I WILL ESTABLISH AN UNKNOWNWORD THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD WHICH IS WHERE THE BIG INDUSTRIAL ECONOMIES COME TOGETHER . WE NEED THE WORLD'S MAJOR UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS TO COME TOGETHER TO TACKLE THESE CHALLENGES . I WANT TO FOCUS ON INTERNATIONAL ATTENTION TO SOLVE THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE LOSING OUR UNKNOWNWORD DRAMATICALLY . THEY PLAY SUCH AN IMPORTANT ROLE IN REMOVING CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE AND WE NEED TO FIGURE OUT HOW TO HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD STRATEGY FOR THAT . WE'VE SEEN HOW GOOD LEADERSHIP CAN MAKE A DIFFERENCE IN SOLVING GLOBAL CLIMATE AND ENVIRONMENTAL PROBLEMS . FORMER PRIME MINISTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNDERSTOOD THE URGENCY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , CALLED A MEETING IN LONDON AND WAS A DRIVING FORCE IN BANNING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . SEVENTH , EVERY SINGLE AMERICAN WILL HAVE A ROLE TO PLAY . EVERYWHERE I GO , I MEET PEOPLE , AND PARTICULARLY YOUNG PEOPLE AND CHILDREN , WHO ASK ME WHAT THEY CAN DO TO FIGHT GLOBAL WARMING . WHAT THEY CAN DO TO BE MORE ENERGY INDEPENDENT . NOW , I ALWAYS TELL THEM ABOUT MY LATE FATHER WHO TURNED OFF EVERY LIGHT BEFORE HE LEFT ANY ROOM AND HE USED TO TURN OFF THE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN WE WENT TO BED AT NIGHT . AS HE USED TO SAY , 'I'M NOT PAYING TO HEAT THE HOUSE , SO GET MORE COVERS .' THAT SOUNDS KIND OF FUNNY , BUT THAT'S WHAT OUR PARENTS AND OUR GRANDPARENTS USED TO DO . WE'VE GOT TO BE MORE UNKNOWNWORD OF HOW WE LIVE TODAY . ON UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL UNKNOWNWORD IN GREATER UNKNOWNWORD THE WAYS INDIVIDUALS , COMMUNITIES , COLLEGES , SCHOOLS , ALL OF US CAN PLAY OUR ROLE . IT STARTS BY ASKING EVERY AMERICAN WHO WISHES TO SIGN A PLEDGE TO DO SO TO REDUCE YOUR PERSONAL CONTRIBUTION TO GLOBAL WARMING -- ENCOURAGE YOUR NEIGHBORS TO DO THE SAME . IF EVERY HOME REPLACED - THIS IS ASTONISHING AND I KEPT SAYING ARE YOU SURE THIS IS TRUE , LISTEN TO THIS - IF EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR HOMES REPLACED JUST ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD WITH ONE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT WOULD SAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO LIGHT MORE THAN 3 MILLION HOMES AND PREVENT THE GREENHOUSE GAS EMISSIONS EQUAL TO THE AMOUNT PRODUCED BY UNKNOWNWORD CARS IN A YEAR . SO WHEN PEOPLE SAY WELL WE'VE GOT TO WAIT FOR THE GOVERNMENT , WE GOT TO WAIT FOR GREAT COMPANIES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD , THAT'S NOT TRUE . THERE'S SOMETHING EVERY ONE OF US CAN DO . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE INDIVIDUALS AND BUSINESSES TO SET THEIR OWN ENERGY SAVING GOALS . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE SCHOOLS , COLLEGES , AND UNIVERSITIES AND STUDENTS TO DO THE SAME . AND GIVE AWARDS SO WE CAN REALLY HOLD UP THE BEST LEADERS . I'M GOING TO CHALLENGE COMMUNITIES TO DO THE SAME AS WELL . WE'RE GOING TO INVEST IN NEW MANAGEMENT TOOLS SO THAT CITIES AND COMMUNITIES CAN KEEP TRACK OF WHAT THEY UNKNOWNWORD AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THE UNITED STATES TREASURY WILL ISSUE UNKNOWNWORD INDEPENDENCE UNKNOWNWORD " DEDICATED TO THE STRATEGIC ENERGY FUND . DURING WORLD WAR II , AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD BILLION WORTH OF WAR UNKNOWNWORD . MORE THAN 6 MILLION AMERICANS VOLUNTEERED TO PARTICIPATE IN BOND DRIVES . I HAVE NO DOUBT THAT WE CAN UNKNOWNWORD TO THAT SAME SENSE OF DUTY AND PATRIOTISM TODAY . AS VICE PRESIDENT GORE SAYS , POLITICAL WILL IS A RENEWABLE RESOURCE . EIGHTH AND UNKNOWNWORD , I AM UNKNOWNWORD MORE THAN A PLAN . I HAVE A STRATEGY TO MAKE THIS REAL . I HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN NOT TO JUST TO MAKE SPEECHES ABOUT WHAT I WANT TO DO , BUT TO TELL YOU HOW I WILL PAY FOR IT AND HOW I WILL DO IT . ONE OF THE BIGGEST PROBLEMS FACING THOSE COUNTRIES THAT DID SIGN THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS TURNING GOOD INTENTIONS INTO ACTUAL , ECONOMICALLY UNKNOWNWORD RESULTS . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CREATE A NATIONAL ENERGY COUNCIL , UNKNOWNWORD ON THE NATIONAL ECONOMIC COUNCIL AND THE NATIONAL SECURITY COUNCIL , TO BRING TOGETHER ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT TO ENSURE THAT WE ALL HAVE THE SAME PRIORITIES AND WE FOLLOW A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PLAN . FOR EXAMPLE , THE ENERGY DEPARTMENT WILL WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE EDUCATION DEPARTMENT ON GOOD MODELS FOR SCHOOL CONSTRUCTION . THE TRANSPORTATION DEPARTMENT WILL WORK MORE CLOSELY WITH THE EPA ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE COUNCIL WILL BE LED BY A NATIONAL ENERGY ADVISER WITH A DIRECT LINE TO THE PRESIDENT TO COORDINATE OUR UNKNOWNWORD EFFORTS AND MAINTAIN ACCOUNTABILITY . I WILL ALSO REFORM THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY . THIS ENERGY TODAY IS FOCUSED UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD FUELS AND NUCLEAR POWER , WITH MUCH LESS ATTENTION TO UNKNOWNWORD LIKE WIND . I WILL FOCUS THE MISSION OF THE DEPARTMENT OF ENERGY ON MOVING US TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE , WITH A NEW APPROACH TO SOLAR AND WIND AND BIOFUELS AND UNKNOWNWORD AND GEOTHERMAL AND OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS A TRANSFORMATIONAL CHALLENGE FOR OUR NATION AND OUR GOVERNMENT . I WILL START MEETING IT ON DAY ONE . IN ONE OF AMERICA'S DARKEST HOURS - SOON AFTER THE ATTACK ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , LONG BEFORE VICTORY WAS ASSURED - PRESIDENT ROOSEVELT ADDRESSED THE NATION IN ONE OF HIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . THE PRESIDENT DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD WORDS . HE SPOKE HONESTLY AND IN GREAT UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT THE SCALE AND UNKNOWNWORD OF THE THREATS WE FACED . HE EVEN ASKED AMERICANS TO TAKE OUT A MAP OF THE WORLD SO THEY COULD FOLLOW ALONG WHAT HE WAS TALKING ABOUT . THE PRESIDENT SAID , 'THE TASK THAT WE AMERICANS NOW FACE WILL TEST US TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE BEEN CALLED UPON FOR SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT . NEVER BEFORE HAVE WE HAD SO LITTLE TIME IN WHICH TO DO SO MUCH .' AMERICANS WERE UP TO THAT TASK . WHILE YOUNG BRAVE TROOPS SERVED , AND BLED AND DIED OVERSEAS , HERE AT HOME AMERICANS DID THEIR PART . MEN AND WOMEN WENT TO WORK IN FACTORIES TO BUILD SHIPS AND UNKNOWNWORD . AMERICANS GREW VICTORY UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD WAR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD FUEL AND ELECTRICITY . THE TASK BEFORE US COMMANDS THE SAME URGENCY AND DEMANDS THE SAME RESOLVE . UNKNOWNWORD THE ENERGY CRISIS IS THE CALLING OF OUR TIME . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , IT WILL BE THE CALLING OF OUR NATION . AND IT WILL UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US . AND JUST AS THE GREATEST GENERATION ROSE TO THE OCCASION , I BELIEVE THE UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION WILL DO THE SAME . [APPLAUSE ] IN MY CAMPAIGN , I HAVE DEFINED THE FOUR BIG GOALS FOR OUR COUNTRY : RESTORE OUR LEADERSHIP IN THE WORLD , REBUILD A STRONG AND PROSPEROUS MIDDLE CLASS , REFORM OUR GOVERNMENT AND RECLAIM THE FUTURE FOR OUR CHILDREN . MEETING THE ENERGY AND CLIMATE CHANGE CHALLENGE IS ESSENTIAL TO REACHING EVERY ONE OF THOSE . I DO NOT WANT TO BE PART OF THE FIRST GENERATION TO LEAVE AMERICA AND THE WORLD IN WORSE SHAPE THAN WHEN WE FOUND THEM . IT WILL NOT HAPPEN ON MY WATCH . [APPLAUSE ] IF YOU WANT AMERICA TO BE IN THE SOLUTIONS BUSINESS AGAIN , IF YOU WANT TO END THE DESTRUCTIVE PARTISANSHIP , IF YOU WANT TO BRING PEOPLE TOGETHER -- JOIN WITH ME IN EMBRACING ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES WE'VE EVER FACED . IT WILL BE AN EXCITING , NOBLE , AND REWARDING UNKNOWNWORD , TAKING US TO PLACES WE CAN'T EVEN IMAGINE TODAY . JUST LIKE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD SHIPS UNKNOWNWORD UP THE WORLD TO AMERICA , WE'RE GOING OPEN UP THE FUTURE TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . AND IF WE DO IT RIGHT THEY WILL LOOK BACK WITH PRIDE ON THIS MOMENT WHEN AMERICANS CAME TOGETHER TO TURN A THREAT TO OUR FUTURE INTO THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS NEW CENTURY .
BLUE	LET ME START BY UNKNOWNWORD A GREAT AMERICAN , AL GORE , FOR BEING NAMED THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NOBEL PEACE UNKNOWNWORD . VICE PRESIDENT GORE HAS BEEN AN EXTRAORDINARY LEADER FOR THIS COUNTRY . THROUGH HIS MANY YEARS OF PUBLIC SERVICE ; HIS EARLY AND UNKNOWNWORD OPPOSITION TO THE WAR IN IRAQ ; AND -- ABOVE ALL -- HIS SINGULAR LEADERSHIP IN DRAWING ATTENTION TO THE GLOBAL CLIMATE CRISIS , AL GORE HAS ADVANCED THE CAUSE OF PEACE AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . THIS AWARD IS RICHLY DESERVED . YOU KNOW , IT WAS FIVE YEARS AGO YESTERDAY THAT THE UNITED STATES SENATE VOTED TO GIVE PRESIDENT BUSH THE AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR IN IRAQ . AT THE TIME , I WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THE U.S . SENATE AND I SPOKE OUT STRONGLY IN OPPOSITION TO GOING TO WAR . NEARLY ALL OF MY OPPONENTS FOR THE DEMOCRATIC NOMINATION FOR PRESIDENT MADE A DIFFERENT CHOICE , AND VOTED TO AUTHORIZE THE WAR . NOW , SOME HAVE ASKED ME , "WHY ARE YOU ALWAYS REMINDING US THAT YOU OPPOSED THE WAR ? ISN'T THAT UNKNOWNWORD NEWS ? IS THAT EXPERIENCE REALLY UNKNOWNWORD ?" AND WHAT I ALWAYS SAY IS THIS -- THIS ISN'T JUST ABOUT THE PAST , IT'S ABOUT THE FUTURE . I DON'T TALK ABOUT MY OPPOSITION TO THE WAR TO SAY "I TOLD YOU SO ." I WISH THE WAR HAD GONE DIFFERENTLY . BUT THE REASON I TALK ABOUT IT IS BECAUSE I TRULY BELIEVE THAT THE JUDGMENT , AND THE CONVICTION , AND THE ACCOUNTABILITY THAT EACH OF US SHOWED ON THE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY DECISION OF OUR LIVES IS THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD YOU HAVE OF HOW EACH OF US WILL MAKE THOSE DECISIONS GOING FORWARD . HOW WE MADE THAT DECISION , AND HOW WE TALK ABOUT IT , IS CRITICAL TO UNDERSTANDING WHAT WE WOULD DO AS PRESIDENT . WILL WE CAREFULLY UNKNOWNWORD THE EVIDENCE AND THE CONSEQUENCES OF ACTION , OR WILL WE UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE INTELLIGENCE AND SCARE PEOPLE WITH THE CONSEQUENCES OF INACTION ? WILL WE MAKE THESE DECISIONS BASED ON POLLS , OR BASED ON OUR PRINCIPLES ? WILL WE HAVE THE COURAGE TO MAKE THE TOUGH CHOICE , OR WILL WE JUST CHOOSE THE COURSE THAT MAKES US LOOK TOUGH ? THESE DECISIONS AREN'T JUST WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD GAMES ABOUT WHO'S UP AND WHO'S DOWN . THESE ARE LIFE AND DEATH DECISIONS . THEY IMPACT YOUR SAFETY AND SECURITY . ABOVE ALL , THEY IMPACT THE SOLDIER FROM IOWA , OR THE UNKNOWNWORD FROM ILLINOIS , AND EVERY SINGLE ONE OF OUR BRAVE YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE IN HARM'S WAY , AND ALL OF THEIR FAMILIES AND FRIENDS BACK HOME . NOW , IT'S EASY TO OPPOSE A WAR AFTER IT HAS GONE WRONG . IT'S EASY TO SAY -- YEARS LATER -- THAT THE WAR SHOULDN'T HAVE HAPPENED , GIVEN WHAT WE KNOW NOW ABOUT HOW BADLY IT HAS TURNED OUT . BUT EVERY SINGLE ONE OF US RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT ONLY HAD ONE CHANCE TO MAKE A JUDGMENT ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO WAR . AS I TRAVEL AROUND THE COUNTRY , SO MANY AMERICANS ASK ME : HOW DID WE GO SO WRONG IN IRAQ ? AND THEY'RE NOT JUST ASKING BECAUSE THEY WANT TO UNDERSTAND THE PAST -- THEY'RE ASKING BECAUSE THEY DON'T WANT THEIR LEADERS TO MAKE THE SAME MISTAKES AGAIN IN THE FUTURE . THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD US DOWN IN UNNECESSARY WARS ; THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO ALLOW AMERICA TO LOSE ITS STANDING ; AND THEY DON'T WANT LEADERS WHO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ANYTHING LESS THAN THE FULL TRUTH ABOUT WHERE THEY STAND AND WHAT UNKNOWNWORD DO . THAT IS A BIG PART OF WHAT THIS CAMPAIGN IS ABOUT . BECAUSE WE NEED TO LEARN THE PAINFUL LESSONS OF THE IRAQ WAR IF WE'RE GOING TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY AND RENEW AMERICA'S LEADERSHIP . THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO UNDERSTAND IS WHAT HAPPENED IN IRAQ . BECAUSE THERE ARE TWO WAYS TO LOOK AT THIS . THE FIRST WAY IS TO SAY THAT IRAQ IS A UNKNOWNWORD BECAUSE OF GEORGE BUSH'S UNKNOWNWORD . OR BECAUSE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND INCOMPETENCE OF DICK CHENEY OR UNKNOWNWORD RUMSFELD IN UNKNOWNWORD THE WAR . OR BECAUSE IRAQ'S PRIME MINISTER JUST HASN'T BEEN UP TO THE JOB . BUT I TAKE A DIFFERENT VIEW . I THINK THE PROBLEM ISN'T JUST HOW WE'VE FOUGHT THE WAR -- IT'S THAT WE FOUGHT THE WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE . BECAUSE THE TRUTH IS , THE WAR IN IRAQ SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN AUTHORIZED , AND IT SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN WAGED . THE IRAQ WAR HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH AL QAEDA OR 9/11 . IT WAS BASED ON UNKNOWNWORD FEARS AND UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE . AND IT HAS LEFT AMERICA LESS SAFE , AND LESS RESPECTED AROUND THE WORLD . FIVE YEARS AGO , MY FRIENDS WARNED ME NOT TO SPEAK UP AGAINST THE WAR . GOING TO WAR WAS POPULAR . SO WAS PRESIDENT BUSH . YOU'LL BE PUTTING YOUR POLITICAL CAREER ON THE LINE , THEY SAID . BUT I JUST DIDN'T SEE HOW SADDAM HUSSEIN POSED AN IMMINENT THREAT . I WAS CONVINCED THAT A WAR WOULD DISTRACT US FROM AFGHANISTAN AND AL QAEDA , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF EXTREMISM AND TERRORISM . AND I DIDN'T GET INTO POLITICS TO STAY SILENT ON THE TOUGH ISSUES , OR TO UNKNOWNWORD MY POSITIONS TO THE POLLS . I DIDN'T WANT TO LOOK BACK , AFTER AN UNNECESSARY WAR HAD BEEN WAGED , AND REGRET THAT I DIDN'T SPEAK OUT AGAINST GOING TO WAR JUST BECAUSE GOING TO WAR WAS POPULAR . SO I SPOKE OUT AGAINST WHAT I CALLED A UNKNOWNWORD WAR " -- A UNKNOWNWORD BASED NOT ON REASON BUT ON POLITICS ." BUT THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING IN WASHINGTON LINED UP FOR WAR . THE PRESIDENT AND HIS ADVISORS TOLD US THAT THE ONLY WAY TO STOP SADDAM HUSSEIN FROM GETTING A NUCLEAR WEAPON WAS TO GO TO WAR , THAT WE COULDN'T LET THE UNKNOWNWORD GUN BE A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . LEADING DEMOCRATS -- INCLUDING SENATOR CLINTON -- ECHOED THE UNKNOWNWORD LINE THAT THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA . WE WERE COUNSELED BY SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED VOICES IN WASHINGTON THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO LOOK TOUGH WAS TO TALK , ACT , AND VOTE LIKE REPUBLICANS . THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT PRESIDENT BUSH FAILED US IN THE UNKNOWNWORD TO WAR . BUT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST FAILED BY THE PRESIDENT -- THEY WERE FAILED BY THE CONGRESS . TOO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS FAILED TO ASK HARD QUESTIONS . TOO MANY MEMBERS OF CONGRESS , INCLUDING SOME OF MY OPPONENTS IN THIS RACE , FAILED TO READ THE NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE ESTIMATE FOR THEMSELVES -- AN INTELLIGENCE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WAS SO UNKNOWNWORD , AND SO FILLED WITH QUALIFICATIONS , THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE DECIDED TO VOTE AGAINST THE WAR WHEN HE READ IT FOR HIMSELF . TOO MANY DEMOCRATS FELL IN LINE WITH GEORGE BUSH , AND VOTED TO GIVE HIM THE OPEN-ENDED AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR THAT HE USES TO THIS DAY . SO LET'S BE CLEAR : WITHOUT THAT VOTE , THERE WOULD BE NO WAR . SENATOR EDWARDS VOTED FOR THE WAR IN 2002 . HE HAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT VOTE , INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT WAS A VOTE FOR ANYTHING BUT WAR . BUT SENATOR CLINTON MAKES A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT . SHE SAYS THAT SHE WASN'T REALLY VOTING FOR WAR BACK IN 2002 , SHE WAS VOTING FOR MORE UNKNOWNWORD , OR SHE WAS VOTING FOR MORE DIPLOMACY . BUT ALL OF US KNOW WHAT WAS BEING DEBATED IN THE CONGRESS IN THE FALL OF 2002 . WE DIDN'T NEED TO AUTHORIZE A WAR IN ORDER TO HAVE UNITED NATIONS WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD . NO ONE THOUGHT CONGRESS WAS DEBATING WHETHER OR NOT TO CONDUCT DIPLOMACY . THE HEADLINES ON UNKNOWNWORD 12 , 2002 DID NOT READ : UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY WITH IRAQ " -- THE HEADLINES ON UNKNOWNWORD 12 , 2002 READ UNKNOWNWORD BACKS WAR ." IN THE COURSE OF THIS CAMPAIGN , WE HAVEN'T JUST SEEN DIFFERENT CANDIDATES TALK ABOUT THEIR VOTE IN DIFFERENT WAYS -- WE'VE SEEN HOW DIFFERENT CANDIDATES HAVE DRAWN DIFFERENT LESSONS FROM THEIR EXPERIENCE OF THE IRAQ WAR . FIVE YEARS LATER , WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSONS OF THAT VOTE -- WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THAT YOU CAN'T GIVE THIS ADMINISTRATION AN EXCUSE TO WAGE WAR . BUT JUST LAST MONTH , THE SENATE VOTED FOR AN AMENDMENT THAT RAISES THE RISK THAT WE COULD UNKNOWNWORD THE MISTAKE OF IRAQ . HERE IS WHY THIS AMENDMENT IS SO RECKLESS . IT OPENS WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD IRAN'S INFLUENCE INSIDE OF IRAQ . THEN IT SAYS WE HAVE TO STRUCTURE OUR MILITARY PRESENCE INSIDE IRAQ TO COUNTER IRAN . IT GOES ON TO SAY THAT IT IS "A CRITICAL NATIONAL INTEREST OF THE UNITED STATES " TO PREVENT THE IRANIAN GOVERNMENT FROM UNKNOWNWORD INFLUENCE INSIDE IRAQ . WHY IS THIS AMENDMENT SO DANGEROUS ? BECAUSE GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY COULD USE THIS LANGUAGE TO UNKNOWNWORD KEEPING OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ AS LONG AS THEY CAN POINT TO A THREAT FROM IRAN . AND BECAUSE THEY COULD USE THIS LANGUAGE TO UNKNOWNWORD AN ATTACK ON IRAN AS A PART OF THE ONGOING WAR IN IRAQ . I DON'T WANT TO GIVE THIS PRESIDENT ANY EXCUSE , OR ANY OPENING FOR WAR . BECAUSE AS WE LEARNED WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQ WAR -- WHEN YOU GIVE THIS PRESIDENT A BLANK CHECK , YOU CAN'T BE SURPRISED WHEN HE UNKNOWNWORD IT . SENATOR CLINTON IS THE ONLY DEMOCRATIC CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT WHO SUPPORTS THIS AMENDMENT . SHE SAID , LIKE SHE DID FIVE YEARS AGO , THAT IT IS A WAY TO SUPPORT DIPLOMACY . I DISAGREE . WE ALL KNOW THAT IRAN POSES A THREAT . WE DO NEED TO MOUNT INTERNATIONAL PRESSURE TO STOP IRAN'S NUCLEAR PROGRAM . WE DO NEED TO TIGHTEN SANCTIONS ON THE IRANIAN REGIME -- PARTICULARLY ON IRAN'S REVOLUTIONARY GUARD , WHICH SUPPORTS TERRORISM . BUT THIS MUST BE DONE UNKNOWNWORD FROM ANY SABER-RATTLING ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD IRANIAN INFLUENCE WITH OUR MILITARY PRESENCE IN IRAQ . WE SHOULD NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR TROOPS HAVE TO STAY IN IRAQ TO COUNTER IRAN . NOW IS THE TIME TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ . NOW IS THE TIME TO START BRINGING OUR TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ -- IMMEDIATELY . THAT'S WHY I HAVE A PLAN TO REMOVE ONE OR TWO COMBAT BRIGADES A MONTH SO THAT WE GET ALL OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ WITHIN 16 MONTHS -- THAT'S AS QUICKLY AND RESPONSIBLY AS WE CAN DO THIS . THE ONLY TROOPS I WILL KEEP IN IRAQ FOR A LIMITED TIME WILL PROTECT OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND CARRY OUT TARGETED STRIKES ON AL QAEDA -- NOT UNKNOWNWORD COMBAT . AND I WILL LAUNCH THE DIPLOMATIC AND UNKNOWNWORD INITIATIVES THAT ARE SO BADLY NEEDED . SO LET THERE BE NO DOUBT : I WILL END THIS WAR . NOW IS NOT THE TIME TO GIVE GEORGE BUSH AND DICK CHENEY ANY EXCUSE TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS WAR . NOW IS NOT THE TIME FOR THE CONGRESS TO SEND MIXED MESSAGES . THAT'S WHY MY POSITION TODAY IS THE SAME AS IT WAS WHEN I STOOD UP IN IOWA ON SEPTEMBER 12 AND SAID : UNKNOWNWORD BUSH AND DICK CHENEY MUST HEAR -- LOUD AND CLEAR -- FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE CONGRESS : YOU DON'T HAVE OUR SUPPORT , AND YOU DON'T HAVE OUR UNKNOWNWORD FOR ANOTHER WAR ." FIVE YEARS AFTER THAT VOTE FOR WAR , WE SHOULD ALL HAVE LEARNED THE LESSON THAT THE COWBOY DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING TO PEOPLE WE DON'T LIKE DOESN'T WORK . WE DO NEED TOUGHER DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN . BUT THE WAY TO SUPPORT TOUGH DIPLOMACY IS NOT TO VOTE FOR RECKLESS UNKNOWNWORD -- THE WAY TO SUPPORT DIPLOMACY IS TO ACTUALLY PURSUE IT . THAT'S WHAT I'VE CALLED FOR THROUGHOUT THIS CAMPAIGN -- DIRECT DIPLOMACY , WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD . AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . NOT THE BUSH-CHENEY DIPLOMACY OF TALKING TO OUR FRIENDS AND IGNORING OUR ENEMIES . REAL , DIRECT , AND UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY . A COUPLE OF MONTHS AGO , SENATOR CLINTON CALLED ME UNKNOWNWORD AND IRRESPONSIBLE " FOR TAKING THIS POSITION , AND SAID THAT WE COULD LOSE UNKNOWNWORD BATTLES IF WE MET WITH LEADERS WE DIDN'T LIKE . JUST YESTERDAY , THOUGH , SHE CALLED FOR DIPLOMACY WITH IRAN WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD . SO I'M NOT SURE IF ANY OF US KNOWS EXACTLY WHERE SHE STANDS ON THIS . BUT I CAN TELL YOU THIS : WHEN I AM PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND THE WORLD WILL ALWAYS KNOW WHERE I STAND . I DON'T SEE HOW WE CAN RALLY THE WORLD UNLESS WE HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO LEAD . I'M NOT AFRAID THAT AMERICA WILL LOSE A UNKNOWNWORD BATTLE WITH A PETTY UNKNOWNWORD -- WE NEED TO GO BEFORE THE WORLD AND WIN THOSE BATTLES . AND AS PRESIDENT , I WILL . YOU KNOW , THE UNKNOWNWORD , CONVENTIONAL THINKING IN WASHINGTON SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS CAN'T TAKE THESE POSITIONS . OR THAT WE NEED TO SAY ONE THING IN A CAUCUS AND PRIMARY CAMPAIGN , BUT ANOTHER IN A GENERAL ELECTION . THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT SAID THAT DEMOCRATS HAD TO VOTE FOR WAR IN 2002 BECAUSE THERE WAS AN ELECTION COMING UP -- AN ELECTION THAT WE LOST . THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT SAYS THAT DEMOCRATS CAN'T WIN ELECTIONS , UNLESS THEY TALK , ACT AND VOTE LIKE REPUBLICANS WHEN IT COMES TO FOREIGN POLICY AND NATIONAL SECURITY . WELL , I'M NOT RUNNING TO CONFORM TO WASHINGTON'S CONVENTIONAL THINKING -- I'M RUNNING TO CHALLENGE IT . THAT'S WHAT I DID IN 2002 . THAT'S WHAT I DID IN 2004 . AND THAT'S WHAT I WILL DO AS PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES . BECAUSE I THINK THE PUNDITS HAVE IT WRONG . I THINK THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO GO OUT OF THEIR WAY TO LOOK TOUGH , WHO SAY ONE THING IN A CAUCUS AND ANOTHER IN A GENERAL ELECTION . WHEN I AM THE NOMINEE OF OUR PARTY , THE CHOICE WILL BE CLEAR . MY REPUBLICAN OPPONENT WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE BOTH SUPPORTED THIS WAR IN IRAQ . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT WE REALLY AGREE ABOUT USING THE WAR IN IRAQ TO UNKNOWNWORD MILITARY ACTION AGAINST IRAN , OR ABOUT THE DIPLOMACY OF NOT TALKING AND SABER-RATTLING . HE WON'T BE ABLE TO SAY THAT I HAVEN'T BEEN OPEN AND STRAIGHT WITH THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , OR THAT I'VE CHANGED MY POSITIONS . AND YOU KNOW WHAT ? THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WANT THAT CHOICE . BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT'S WHAT WE NEED IN OUR NEXT PRESIDENT . WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF A MISGUIDED WAR IN IRAQ THAT NEVER SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOUGHT -- A WAR THAT NEEDS TO END . WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF PRESIDENTS WHO PUT TOUGH TALK AHEAD OF REAL DIPLOMACY . AND WE'VE HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO PUT POWER OVER PRINCIPLE , OF A GOVERNMENT IN WASHINGTON THAT UNKNOWNWORD YOU OUT , AND OF PRESIDENTS WHO DON'T HOLD THEMSELVES ACCOUNTABLE . THIS IS ABOUT WHAT WE STAND FOR AS DEMOCRATS . BUT MUCH MORE THAN THAT -- IT'S ABOUT WHAT WE STAND FOR AS AMERICANS . BECAUSE THERE ARE PLENTY OF DEMOCRATS AND PLENTY OF INDEPENDENTS AND , YES , PLENTY OF REPUBLICANS OUT THERE WHO ARE READY TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE BROKEN POLITICS AND UNKNOWNWORD FOREIGN POLICY COMING FROM WASHINGTON . THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER . THAT'S HOW WE'RE GOING TO RESTORE OUR SECURITY AND RENEW OUR STANDING IN THE WORLD . NOT BY UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD , BUT BY STANDING STRONG IN ANY STORM , AND STANDING UP FOR WHAT WE BELIEVE . I WOULD NOT BE ON THIS STAGE TODAY IF THE PROMISE OF AMERICA HAD NOT BROUGHT MY FATHER ACROSS AN OCEAN . I WOULD NOT BE ON THIS STAGE IF GENERATIONS OF AMERICANS HAD NOT FOUGHT BEFORE ME SO THAT THE AMERICAN DREAM COULD BE EXTENDED TO A MAN NAMED BARACK OBAMA . THAT'S WHY I HAVE SPENT MY OWN LIFE FIGHTING FOR THAT DREAM , NO MATTER HOW DIFFICULT IT'S BEEN , NO MATTER HOW TOUGH IT WAS TO TAKE A STAND . THAT'S WHY I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU WHERE I STAND AND WHAT I BELIEVE . AND WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THAT IS HOW WE WILL MEET THE HARD CHALLENGES , AND RECLAIM THAT DREAM , AND MAKE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA A LIGHT TO THE WORLD ONCE MORE .
BLUE	 TWO WEEKS AGO , UNKNOWNWORD FROM SOME OF THE WORLD'S LARGEST UNKNOWNWORD OF GREENHOUSE GASES WERE INVITED TO WASHINGTON BY THE PRESIDENT FOR A GLOBAL CONFERENCE ON CLIMATE CHANGE . FOR A UNKNOWNWORD MOMENT , THERE WAS A HOPE THAT MAYBE THIS CONFERENCE WOULD BE DIFFERENT - THAT MAYBE AMERICA WOULD FINALLY COMMIT TO THE STEPS THAT NEARLY EVERY SCIENTIST AND EXPERT BELIEVES WE MUST TAKE ; THAT MAYBE THE UNKNOWNWORD ONLY SUPERPOWER WOULD FINALLY LEAD THE WORLD - OR AT THE VERY LEAST , FOLLOW IT - IN TAKING ON THE UNKNOWNWORD GREATEST THREAT . INSTEAD , THE WORLD TRAVELED THOUSANDS OF MILES TO WASHINGTON ONLY TO FIND THAT WASHINGTON IS STILL MILES AWAY FROM THE WORLD IN ITS WILLINGNESS TO ADDRESS ONE OF THE MOST URGENT CHALLENGES OF OUR GENERATION . SOME OF THE UNKNOWNWORD SAID THEY WERE AMAZED AT HOW UNKNOWNWORD THE WHITE HOUSE VIEW HAD BECOME . OTHERS UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENT'S CREDIBILITY ENTIRELY . AND ANOTHER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE GLOBAL DEBATE ON CLIMATE CHANGE , OUR COUNTRY IS STRUGGLING JUST TO STAY UNKNOWNWORD . STRUGGLING JUST TO STAY UNKNOWNWORD . THAT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE KNOW . IT IS NOT THE AMERICA WE BELIEVE IN . WE ARE A NATION THAT HAS LED THE WORLD EVER SINCE THE MOMENT A UNKNOWNWORD BAND OF COLONISTS PROVED THAT FREEDOM COULD UNKNOWNWORD OVER TYRANNY . WE ARE THE COUNTRY THAT SUMMONED THE COURAGE OF ITS PEOPLE TO BUILD AN ARSENAL OF DEMOCRACY THAT UNKNOWNWORD A CONTINENT AND BROUGHT PEACE TO A WORLD AT WAR . WE ARE A LAND OF MOON SHOTS AND UNKNOWNWORD OF SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE LIVES OF MILLIONS ACROSS THE PLANET . AND WHEN THAT PLANET IS CHALLENGED OR WHEN IT IS THREATENED , THE EYES OF THE WORLD HAVE ALWAYS TURNED TO THIS NATION AS THE UNKNOWNWORD , BEST HOPE OF EARTH ." THAT IS THE AMERICA I WANT TO LEAD AS PRESIDENT . I BELIEVE THAT WHEN IT COMES TO THE ISSUE THAT WILL DETERMINE THE VERY FUTURE OF LIFE ON THIS EARTH , WE ARE STILL EARTH'S BEST HOPE . AND WHEN THE WORLD UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WHITE HOUSE TO HEAR WHAT AMERICA HAS TO SAY ABOUT CLIMATE CHANGE , I WILL LET THEM KNOW THAT AMERICA IS UP TO THE CHALLENGE . THAT AMERICA IS READY TO LEAD AGAIN . WE HAVE NOT FALLEN BEHIND ON ENERGY DUE TO A LACK OF INGENUITY OR INITIATIVE FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I HAVE SEEN TOO MUCH INNOVATION AND POSSIBILITY IN THIS COUNTRY TO BELIEVE THAT . RIGHT HERE IN NEW HAMPSHIRE , I'VE FILLED UP AT A BIODIESEL UNKNOWNWORD AT UNKNOWNWORD , WHERE THIS YEAR STUDENTS AND UNKNOWNWORD WILL REMOVE OVER 200 UNKNOWNWORD OF CARBON DIOXIDE FROM THE ATMOSPHERE . NEW HAMPSHIRE IS ALREADY REDUCING ITS GREENHOUSE GAS POLLUTION AS PART OF THE REGIONAL GREENHOUSE GAS INITIATIVE , AND THANKS TO THE LEADERSHIP OF SENATOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND GOVERNOR UNKNOWNWORD , YOU'LL GET 25 % OF YOUR ENERGY FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES BY UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD IS ONE OF AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD CITIES , AND I UNDERSTAND THAT UNKNOWNWORD TOWNS HAVE NOW PASSED A RESOLUTION DEMANDING THAT WASHINGTON TAKE ACTION ON CLIMATE CHANGE BUT WASHINGTON HASN'T UNKNOWNWORD ; AND THAT IS THE REAL REASON WHY AMERICA HASN'T LED . WASHINGTON'S FAILURE TO LEAD ON ENERGY IS THE FAILURE OF A PRESIDENT WHO SPENT MOST OF HIS TIME IN OFFICE DENYING THE VERY UNKNOWNWORD OF GLOBAL WARMING - A PRESIDENT WHO PUT MORE FAITH IN THE SPIN OF A SCIENCE FICTION UNKNOWNWORD THAN THE SCIENCE FACTS OF REAL EXPERTS . IT'S THE FAILURE OF AN ADMINISTRATION THAT DEVELOPED AMERICA'S ENERGY POLICY WITH A SECRET TASK FORCE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE DOOR TO OIL LOBBYISTS AND THEN SHUT IT TO EVERY OTHER UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S A FAILURE OF LEADERSHIP THAT HAS NEVER CALLED ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO DO ANYTHING MORE THAN GO SHOPPING . AND IT'S ALSO A FAILURE OF OUR POLITICS THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE PRESIDENCY OF GEORGE W . BUSH . WE HAVE HEARD PROMISES ABOUT ENERGY INDEPENDENCE FROM EVERY SINGLE U.S . PRESIDENT SINCE RICHARD NIXON - REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS . WE'VE HEARD PROPOSALS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR USE OF FOSSIL FUELS IN NEARLY EVERY STATE OF THE UNION ADDRESS SINCE THE OIL UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BACK THEN WE UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT A THIRD OF OUR OIL . NOW WE UNKNOWNWORD OVER HALF . BACK THEN GLOBAL WARMING WAS JUST THE THEORY OF A FEW SCIENTISTS . NOW IT IS A FACT THAT THREATENS OUR VERY UNKNOWNWORD . THE TRUTH IS , OUR ENERGY PROBLEM HAS BECOME AN ENERGY CRISIS BECAUSE NO MATTER HOW UNKNOWNWORD THE PROMISE - NO MATTER HOW BOLD THE PROPOSAL - THEY ALL FALL UNKNOWNWORD TO THE SAME WASHINGTON POLITICS THAT HAS ONLY BECOME MORE DIVIDED AND UNKNOWNWORD ; MORE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE POWERFUL INTERESTS THAT HAVE THE BIGGEST STAKE IN THE STATUS QUO . THERE ARE SOME IN THIS RACE WHO ACTUALLY MAKE THE ARGUMENT THAT THE MORE TIME YOU SPEND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE BROKEN POLITICS OF WASHINGTON , THE MORE LIKELY YOU ARE TO CHANGE IT . I ALWAYS FIND THIS A LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD . I KNOW THAT CHANGE MAKES FOR GOOD CAMPAIGN RHETORIC , BUT WHEN THESE SAME PEOPLE HAD THE CHANCE TO ACTUALLY MAKE CHANGE HAPPEN , THEY DIDN'T LEAD . WHEN THEY HAD THE CHANCE TO STAND UP AND REQUIRE AUTOMAKERS TO RAISE THEIR FUEL STANDARDS , THEY REFUSED . WHEN THEY HAD MULTIPLE CHANCES TO REDUCE OUR DEPENDENCE ON FOREIGN OIL BY INVESTING IN RENEWABLE FUELS THAT WE CAN LITERALLY GROW RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA , THEY SAID NO . NOW , I KNOW THAT SOME OF THESE POLICIES ARE DIFFICULT POLITICALLY . THEY AREN'T EASY . BUT BEING PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES ISN'T ABOUT DOING WHAT'S EASY . IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S HARD . IT'S ABOUT DOING WHAT'S RIGHT . LEADERSHIP ISN'T ABOUT TELLING PEOPLE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR - IT'S ABOUT TELLING THEM WHAT THEY NEED TO HEAR . WHEN I ARRIVED IN THE U.S . SENATE , I WANTED TO DO WHATEVER I COULD TO MAKE REAL PROGRESS TOWARD ENERGY INDEPENDENCE . I REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO PASS A LAW THAT WILL GIVE MORE AMERICANS THE CHANCE TO FILL UP THEIR CARS WITH CLEAN BIOFUELS . I PASSED A LAW THAT WILL FUEL THE RESEARCH NEEDED TO DEVELOP A CAR THAT WILL GET UNKNOWNWORD MILES TO THE UNKNOWNWORD . I EVEN VOTED FOR AN ENERGY BILL THAT WAS FAR FROM PERFECT BECAUSE I WAS ABLE TO ENSURE THAT IT CONTAINED SOME REAL INVESTMENTS IN RENEWABLE SOURCES OF ENERGY . AND I'VE FOUGHT TO ELIMINATE THE TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO OIL COMPANIES THAT WERE UNKNOWNWORD INTO THAT BILL - OIL COMPANIES THAT HAVE SPENT HALF A BILLION DOLLARS LOBBYING CONGRESS IN THE LAST TEN YEARS WHILE THEIR PROFITS HAVE RISEN TO RECORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND I DID SOMETHING ELSE . I KNEW THAT AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD RAISED THE FUEL STANDARDS FOR OUR CARS IN TWENTY YEARS . EVEN THOUGH WE HAD THE TECHNOLOGY ON THE UNKNOWNWORD . EVEN THOUGH JAPANESE CAR COMPANIES THAT MAKE MORE FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS ARE RUNNING UNKNOWNWORD AROUND OUR OWN CAR COMPANIES . EVEN THOUGH WE SEND HUNDREDS OF MILLIONS OF DOLLARS A DAY TO SOME OF THE WORLD'S MOST DANGEROUS REGIMES FOR THEIR OIL . SO I DECIDED TO TRY SOMETHING NEW . I REACHED ACROSS THE AISLE TO COME UP WITH A PLAN TO RAISE OUR FUEL STANDARDS THAT WON SUPPORT OF UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAD NEVER SUPPORTED RAISING FUEL STANDARDS BEFORE . AND I DIDN'T JUST GIVE A SPEECH ABOUT IT IN FRONT OF SOME ENVIRONMENTAL AUDIENCE IN CALIFORNIA . I WENT TO DETROIT , I STOOD IN FRONT OF A GROUP OF AUTOMAKERS , AND I TOLD THEM THAT WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , THERE WILL BE NO MORE EXCUSES - WE WILL HELP THEM RETOOL THEIR FACTORIES , BUT THEY WILL HAVE TO MAKE CARS THAT USE LESS OIL . NOW I HAVE TO ADMIT - THE ROOM WAS PRETTY QUIET AFTER THAT . BUT I SAID WHAT I DID BECAUSE I BELIEVE AMERICA HAS HAD ENOUGH OF POLITICIANS WHO JUST TELL EVERYONE WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR . WE HAVE TO TELL PEOPLE THE TRUTH . AND THE TRUTH IS THAT WE CAN'T AFFORD TO LET THE SAME OLD POLITICS STAND IN THE WAY OF OUR FUTURE ANYMORE . WE CAN'T AFFORD THE SAME KIND OF CAUTION WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR SECURITY IS AT STAKE . WE KNOW THAT THE MONEY THAT AMERICA SPENDS ON FOREIGN OIL IS FUNDING BOTH SIDES OF THE WAR ON TERROR ; THAT IT PAYS FOR EVERYTHING FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT PLANT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TERROR IN YOUNG MINDS TO THE SUNNI UNKNOWNWORD THAT ATTACK OUR TROOPS IN IRAQ . WE KNOW THIS MONEY CORRUPTS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND ALLOWS DICTATORS FROM HOSTILE REGIMES TO THREATEN THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY . IT EVEN UNKNOWNWORD A TARGET FOR OSAMA BIN LADEN , WHO HAS TOLD AL QAEDA TO , UNKNOWNWORD YOUR OPERATIONS ON OIL , SINCE THIS WILL CAUSE UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS ] TO DIE OFF ON THEIR OWN ." WE CAN'T BE AFRAID TO STAND UP TO THE OIL AND AUTO INDUSTRY WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR ECONOMY IS AT STAKE . WHEN WE LET THESE COMPANIES OFF THE HOOK ; WHEN WE TELL THEM THEY DON'T HAVE TO BUILD FUEL-EFFICIENT CARS OR UNKNOWNWORD TO RENEWABLE FUELS , IT MAY BOOST THEIR SHORT-TERM PROFITS , BUT IT IS KILLING THEIR LONG-TERM CHANCES FOR SURVIVAL AND THREATENING TOO MANY AMERICAN JOBS . THE GLOBAL MARKET IS ALREADY MOVING AWAY FROM FOSSIL FUELS . THE QUESTION IS NOT IF A RENEWABLE ENERGY ECONOMY WILL THRIVE IN THE FUTURE , IT'S WHERE . AND IF WE WANT THAT PLACE TO BE THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , WE CAN'T AFFORD TO WAIT ANY LONGER . MOST OF ALL , WE CANNOT AFFORD MORE OF THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD POLITICS WHEN THE FUTURE OF OUR PLANET IS AT STAKE . GLOBAL WARMING IS NOT A SOMEDAY PROBLEM , IT IS NOW . IN A STATE LIKE NEW HAMPSHIRE , THE UNKNOWNWORD INDUSTRY IS FACING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND LOSING JOBS . WE ARE ALREADY BREAKING RECORDS WITH THE INTENSITY OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD , THE NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . BY 2050 UNKNOWNWORD COULD FORCE MORE THAN 250 MILLION FROM THEIR HOMES - UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES OF WAR AND STRIFE IN MANY OF THE WORLD'S UNKNOWNWORD STATES . THE UNKNOWNWORD ICE CAPS ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD FASTER THAN SCIENCE HAD EVER UNKNOWNWORD . AND IF WE DO NOTHING , UNKNOWNWORD LEVELS WILL RISE HIGH ENOUGH TO UNKNOWNWORD LARGE UNKNOWNWORD OF EVERY UNKNOWNWORD CITY AND TOWN . THIS IS NOT THE FUTURE I WANT FOR MY DAUGHTERS . IT'S NOT THE FUTURE ANY OF US WANT FOR OUR CHILDREN . AND IF WE ACT NOW AND WE ACT BOLDLY , IT DOESN'T HAVE TO BE . BUT IF WE WAIT ; IF WE LET CAMPAIGN PROMISES AND STATE OF THE UNION UNKNOWNWORD GO UNKNOWNWORD FOR YET ANOTHER YEAR ; IF WE LET THE SAME BROKEN POLITICS THAT'S HELD US BACK FOR DECADES WIN ONE MORE TIME , WE WILL LOSE ANOTHER CHANCE TO SAVE OUR PLANET . AND WE MIGHT NOT GET MANY MORE . I REJECT THAT FUTURE . I WOULD NOT BE RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THAT THIS TIME COULD BE DIFFERENT . NOT BECAUSE I HAVE SOME PERFECT SOLUTION THAT EVERY OTHER EXPERT AND CANDIDATE HAS SOMEHOW MISSED . NOT BECAUSE I THINK I CAN LOCK MYSELF IN THE WHITE HOUSE WITH A SECRET TASK FORCE AND GET THIS DONE ON MY OWN . BUT BECAUSE I BELIEVE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE READY FOR A PRESIDENT WHO CAN UNITE US AROUND A COMMON PURPOSE AGAIN . I BELIEVE THAT WE ARE READY TO LEAD AGAIN . MAKE NO MISTAKE - DEVELOPING THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENERGY WILL BE ONE OF THE GREATEST CHALLENGES THAT THIS GENERATION OF AMERICANS WILL EVER FACE . IT WILL NOT BE EASY . IT WILL NOT COME WITHOUT COST OR WITHOUT SACRIFICE . AND IF ANYONE TRIES TO TELL YOU OTHERWISE , THEY ARE EITHER UNKNOWNWORD THEMSELVES OR TRYING TO UNKNOWNWORD YOU . I WILL SET BIG GOALS FOR THIS COUNTRY AS PRESIDENT - SOME SO LARGE THAT THE TECHNOLOGY TO REACH THEM DOES NOT YET EXIST . BUT THAT HAS NOT STOPPED US BEFORE . WHEN PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD ADVISORS INFORMED HIM THAT HIS GOALS FOR UNKNOWNWORD PRODUCTION WERE IMPOSSIBLE TO MEET , HE UNKNOWNWORD THEM OFF AND SAID UNKNOWNWORD ME , THE PRODUCTION PEOPLE CAN DO IT IF THEY REALLY TRY ." AND THEY DID . WHEN THE SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS TOLD JOHN F . KENNEDY THAT THEY HAD NO IDEA HOW TO PUT A MAN ON THE MOON , HE TOLD THEM THEY WOULD FIND A WAY . AND WE FOUND ONE . I BELIEVE WE WILL AGAIN . IN THE SPEECH I GAVE IN DETROIT , I LAID OUT THE FIRST PART OF MY COMPREHENSIVE ENERGY PLAN - A PROPOSAL THAT WILL REQUIRE OUR CARS TO USE LESS OIL AND OUR FUELS TO USE LESS CARBON . IT'S A PROPOSAL THAT ALONE UNKNOWNWORD 50 MILLION CARS ' WORTH OF POLLUTION FROM THE ROAD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR OIL CONSUMPTION UNKNOWNWORD MILLION UNKNOWNWORD A DAY BY UNKNOWNWORD - THE EQUIVALENT OF ALL THE OIL WE UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . TODAY I WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE SECOND PART OF MY PLAN - A SET OF PROPOSALS THAT WILL ALLOW AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD IN COMBATING GLOBAL CLIMATE CHANGE . FROM THE MOMENT I TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT , I WILL CALL TOGETHER SCIENTISTS AND ENTREPRENEURS ; HEADS OF INDUSTRY AND LABOR ; DEMOCRATS , REPUBLICANS AND AMERICANS FROM ALL UNKNOWNWORD OF LIFE TO HELP DEVELOP AND UNKNOWNWORD THE NEXT GENERATION OF ENERGY THAT WILL ALLOW US TO BUILD THE NEXT GENERATION'S ECONOMY . AFTER ALL , IN MEETING THE CHALLENGES OF EARLIER GENERATIONS , WE DIDN'T JUST END A COSTLY WAR OR BEAT THE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE MOON - WE ALSO UNLEASHED OPPORTUNITIES WE HAD NEVER DREAMED OF . THE GI BILL SENT AN ENTIRE GENERATION OF AMERICANS - INCLUDING MY GRANDFATHER - TO COLLEGE AND THEN ON TO THE MIDDLE-CLASS . UNKNOWNWORD OF SCIENTISTS AND ENGINEERS UNKNOWNWORD FROM OUR RACE TO SPACE WHOSE DISCOVERIES AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE FOREVER CHANGED THE WORLD . THIS SAME OPPORTUNITY EXISTS TODAY . THAT'S WHY MY PLAN ISN'T JUST ABOUT MAKING UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY EXPENSIVE , IT'S ABOUT MAKING CLEAN ENERGY AFFORDABLE - A PROJECT THAT WILL CREATE MILLIONS OF NEW JOBS AND ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES RIGHT HERE IN AMERICA . THE FIRST STEP IN DOING THIS IS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT A UNKNOWNWORD ECONOMY THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD OUR CHANGING CLIMATE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL SET A HARD CAP ON ALL CARBON EMISSIONS AT A LEVEL THAT SCIENTISTS SAY IS NECESSARY TO UNKNOWNWORD GLOBAL WARMING - AN 80 % UNKNOWNWORD BY 2050 . TO ENSURE THIS ISN'T JUST TALK , I WILL ALSO COMMIT TO UNKNOWNWORD TARGETS TOWARD THIS GOAL IN UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . THESE UNKNOWNWORD WILL START IMMEDIATELY , AND WE'LL CONTINUE TO FOLLOW THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TOP SCIENTISTS TO ENSURE THAT OUR TARGETS ARE STRONG ENOUGH TO MEET THE CHALLENGE WE FACE . IN ADDITION TO THIS CAP , ALL POLLUTERS WILL HAVE TO PAY BASED ON THE AMOUNT OF POLLUTION THEY UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE SKY . THE MARKET WILL SET THE PRICE , BUT UNLIKE THE OTHER UNKNOWNWORD PROPOSALS THAT HAVE BEEN OFFERED IN THIS RACE , NO BUSINESS WILL BE ALLOWED TO UNKNOWNWORD ANY UNKNOWNWORD GASES FOR FREE . BUSINESSES DON'T OWN THE SKY , THE PUBLIC DOES , AND IF WE WANT THEM TO STOP UNKNOWNWORD IT , WE HAVE TO PUT A PRICE ON ALL POLLUTION . IT'S TIME TO MAKE THE CLEANER WAY OF DOING BUSINESS THE MORE UNKNOWNWORD WAY OF DOING BUSINESS . THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS UNKNOWNWORD WILL BE COSTLY IN THE SHORT-TERM . TO MAKE IT EASIER , WE WILL PROVIDE ASSISTANCE TO AMERICANS WHO NEED HELP WITH THEIR ENERGY BILLS . WE'LL HELP FAMILIES MAKE THEIR HOMES MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT , AND WE'LL HELP WORKERS AND FACTORIES RETOOL THEIR FACILITIES SO THEY CAN COMPETE AND THRIVE IN A CLEAN ENERGY ECONOMY . AND ONCE WE MAKE AMERICA MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT AND START PRODUCING MORE RENEWABLE ENERGY , WE WILL SAVE MONEY AND BRING ENERGY COSTS DOWN IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE MUST ACT NOW . ONCE WE MAKE UNKNOWNWORD ENERGY EXPENSIVE , THE SECOND STEP IN MY PLAN IS TO INVEST UNKNOWNWORD BILLION OVER THE NEXT DECADE TO ENSURE THE DEVELOPMENT AND DEPLOYMENT OF CLEAN , AFFORDABLE ENERGY . THAT STARTS WITH THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUELS . WE KNOW THAT CORN ETHANOL HAS BEEN THE MOST SUCCESSFUL ALTERNATIVE FUEL WE HAVE EVER DEVELOPED . I'VE BEEN A CHAMPION FOR ETHANOL . IN JUST TWO YEARS , THE RENEWABLE FUEL STANDARD I HELPED PASS HAS UNKNOWNWORD AN HISTORIC EXPANSION OF ETHANOL PRODUCTION . IT HAS HELPED UNKNOWNWORD FOREIGN OIL AND STRENGTHEN OUR RURAL ECONOMY . AND WE SHOULD FIGHT THE EFFORTS OF BIG OIL AND BIG UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS EMERGING INDUSTRY . BUT THE TRUTH IS , CORN ETHANOL IS NEITHER THE PERFECT NOR THE PERMANENT ANSWER TO OUR ENERGY CHALLENGE . THERE ARE LEGITIMATE ECONOMIC AND UNKNOWNWORD CONCERNS ABOUT AN UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL . AND EVEN IF WE DOUBLE OR UNKNOWNWORD ITS PRODUCTION , IT WON'T REPLACE EVEN A TENTH OF OUR DEMAND FOR GASOLINE . THAT'S WHY WE MUST INVEST IN THE NEXT GENERATION OF ADVANCED BIOFUELS LIKE UNKNOWNWORD ETHANOL THAT CAN BE MADE FROM THINGS LIKE SWITCHGRASS AND UNKNOWNWORD . THE STRUGGLING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE BACK IN BUSINESS IF THEY COULD USE UNKNOWNWORD TO PRODUCE BIOFUELS . WE SHOULD SET A GOAL TO PRODUCE THE FIRST TWO BILLION GALLONS OF ADVANCED BIOFUELS BY UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE SHOULD MAKE SURE THAT MORE LOCAL FARMS AND LOCAL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE THE CHANCE TO BE A PART OF THIS NEW INDUSTRY . WE'LL ALSO INVEST IN CLEAN ENERGY SOURCES LIKE WIND POWER AND SOLAR POWER , SO THAT BY UNKNOWNWORD , AMERICA CAN MEET A NEW STANDARD THAT WILL REQUIRE 25 % OF ALL OUR ELECTRICITY TO COME FROM RENEWABLE SOURCES . AND WE MUST FIND A WAY TO STOP COAL FROM UNKNOWNWORD OUR ATMOSPHERE WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD THAT OUR NATION'S MOST ABUNDANT ENERGY SOURCE WILL JUST GO AWAY . IT WON'T . IT WILL ALSO REQUIRE TAKING STEPS TO ENSURE THAT CHINA'S COAL EMISSIONS ARE UNKNOWNWORD AS WELL . ALREADY , SOME COAL POLLUTION FROM CHINA'S UNKNOWNWORD PLANTS IS MAKING ITS WAY TO CALIFORNIA . THAT'S WHY WE MUST INVEST IN CLEAN COAL TECHNOLOGIES THAT WE CAN USE AT HOME AND SHARE WITH THE WORLD . UNTIL THOSE TECHNOLOGIES ARE AVAILABLE , I WILL RELY ON THE CARBON CAP AND WHATEVER TOOLS ARE NECESSARY TO STOP NEW UNKNOWNWORD COAL PLANTS FROM BEING BUILT IN AMERICA - INCLUDING A BAN ON NEW TRADITIONAL COAL FACILITIES . WE WILL ALSO UNKNOWNWORD SAFER WAYS TO USE NUCLEAR POWER , WHICH RIGHT NOW ACCOUNTS FOR MORE THAN UNKNOWNWORD % OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ELECTRICITY . WE SHOULD ACCELERATE RESEARCH INTO TECHNOLOGIES THAT WILL ALLOW FOR THE SAFE , SECURE TREATMENT OF NUCLEAR WASTE . AS PRESIDENT , I'LL CONTINUE THE WORK I BEGAN IN THE SENATE TO ENSURE THAT ALL NUCLEAR MATERIAL IS UNKNOWNWORD , SECURED AND ACCOUNTED FOR - BOTH AT HOME AND AROUND THE WORLD . THERE SHOULD BE NO SHORT CUTS OR REGULATORY UNKNOWNWORD - PERIOD . MANY OF THESE CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES - FROM BIOFUELS TO SOLAR POWER TO CARBON UNKNOWNWORD - ARE BEING DEVELOPED IN RESEARCH UNKNOWNWORD AND FACILITIES ALL ACROSS AMERICA AT THIS VERY MOMENT . THE PROBLEM IS THEY MIGHT NEVER GET FURTHER THAN THAT . U.S . VENTURE CAPITAL FUNDING DOES A GREAT JOB INVESTING IN RESEARCH AND DEVELOPMENT , BUT WE DON'T DO ENOUGH TO TAKE THE RISK OUT OF BRINGING NEW DISCOVERIES TO THE WIDER MARKETPLACE . AND SO WE SEE TECHNOLOGIES THAT ARE INVENTED HERE IN AMERICA - LIKE WIND UNKNOWNWORD , SOLAR PANELS , AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - DEVELOPED OVERSEAS AND THEN SOLD BACK TO AMERICAN CONSUMERS . THIS WILL CHANGE WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I WILL LAUNCH A CLEAN TECHNOLOGIES VENTURE CAPITAL FUND THAT WILL PROVIDE $10 BILLION A YEAR FOR FIVE YEARS TO GET THE MOST PROMISING CLEAN ENERGY TECHNOLOGIES OFF THE GROUND . THIS VENTURE CAPITAL FUND WILL GET NEW TECHNOLOGIES FROM THE LAB TO THE MARKETPLACE SO THAT IN THE NEXT FEW YEARS , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY CAN BENEFIT FROM AMERICA'S UNKNOWNWORD . THE THIRD STEP IN MY PLAN TO COMBAT CLIMATE CHANGE IS TO CALL ON BUSINESSES , GOVERNMENT , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE TO MAKE AMERICA 50 % MORE ENERGY EFFICIENT BY UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS BY FAR THE FASTEST , UNKNOWNWORD , AND CHEAPEST WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR EMISSIONS AND SAVE MONEY AT THE SAME TIME . SINCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AN ENERGY EFFICIENCY PROGRAM IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE COMPANY HAS UNKNOWNWORD REDUCED ITS POLLUTION AND CUT ITS ENERGY BILLS BY $3 BILLION , AND CITIES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD HAVE LED IN MEETING NEW EFFICIENCY STANDARDS . THERE IS NO REASON THE REST OF AMERICA CAN'T DO THE SAME . WE WILL START BY DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING THE EFFICIENCY OF OUR BUILDINGS , WHICH CURRENTLY ACCOUNT FOR NEARLY HALF OF ALL CARBON EMISSIONS IN AMERICA TODAY . WHEN I AM PRESIDENT , WE'LL SET A GOAL OF MAKING OUR NEW BUILDINGS 50 % MORE EFFICIENT WITHIN SEVERAL YEARS . THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT WILL LEAD BY MAKING ALL OF ITS BUILDINGS CARBON UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . AND I WILL SET A NATIONAL GOAL OF MAKING ALL NEW BUILDINGS IN AMERICA CARBON UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD . WE WILL ALSO START REPLACING OUR UNKNOWNWORD POWER GRID WITH A DIGITAL SMART GRID SO THAT WE DON'T LOSE PRECIOUS ENERGY AND BILLIONS OF DOLLARS LIKE WE DID IN THE 2003 NEW YORK CITY UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL FOLLOW THE LEAD OF STATES LIKE CALIFORNIA AND CHANGE THE WAY UTILITIES MAKE MONEY SO THAT THEIR PROFITS AREN'T TIED TO HOW MUCH ENERGY WE USE , BUT HOW MUCH ENERGY WE SAVE . FINALLY , WE KNOW THAT IF EVERY HOME IN AMERICA REPLACED JUST FIVE UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD WITH FIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , IT WOULD ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR UNKNOWNWORD POWER PLANTS . WE'LL DO ONE BETTER . I WILL IMMEDIATELY SIGN A LAW THAT BEGINS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUT ALL UNKNOWNWORD LIGHT UNKNOWNWORD - A MEASURE THAT WILL SAVE AMERICAN CONSUMERS UNKNOWNWORD BILLION A YEAR ON THEIR ELECTRIC BILLS . NOW , NONE OF THESE STEPS WILL HAPPEN OVERNIGHT . THEY WILL TAKE TIME , THEY WILL TAKE SACRIFICE , AND THEY WILL TAKE A UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT FROM THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL LEAD THIS COMMITMENT . I WILL NOT BE UNKNOWNWORD THESE GOALS IN MY STATE OF THE UNION AND THEN WALK AWAY WHEN THEY BECOME TOO DIFFICULT . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE EVERY YEAR ON THE STATE OF OUR ENERGY FUTURE , AND LET YOU KNOW THE PROGRESS WE'VE MADE TOWARD AN 80 % EMISSIONS UNKNOWNWORD BY 2050 , TOWARD REPLACING OVER A THIRD OF OUR OIL CONSUMPTION BY UNKNOWNWORD , AND TOWARD IMPROVING OUR ENERGY EFFICIENCY 50 % BY UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL ALSO MAKE AMERICA'S ENERGY SECURITY A FUNDAMENTAL TENET OF OUR NATIONAL SECURITY BY PREPARING OUR MILITARY TO DEAL WITH THREATS POSED BY CLIMATE CHANGE . AND THERE IS ONE STEP I WILL TAKE AS SOON AS POSSIBLE . FROM THE MOMENT I TAKE OFFICE , I WILL INVITE THE WORLD BACK TO WASHINGTON AND LET IT BE KNOWN THAT THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IS READY TO LEAD AGAIN . THAT WE ARE READY TO UNKNOWNWORD THE COMMUNITY OF NATIONS IN TAKING ON THE GREATEST CHALLENGE OF THIS GENERATION . I WILL PERSONALLY REACH OUT TO THE LEADERS OF THE BIGGEST CARBON EMITTING NATIONS IN BOTH THE DEVELOPED AND DEVELOPING WORLD AND ASK THEM TO JOIN AMERICA IN CREATING A NEW GLOBAL ENERGY UNKNOWNWORD THAT WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE FOUNDATION FOR THE NEXT GENERATION OF CLIMATE PROTOCOLS . IT WILL UNKNOWNWORD - AND ULTIMATELY UNKNOWNWORD WITH - THE MUCH LARGER UNKNOWNWORD PROCESS UNKNOWNWORD AT THE UN TO DEVELOP A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I WILL BE IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THESE LEADERS TO DEVELOP UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD EMISSIONS TARGETS THAT ALL OF US WILL MEET . WE WILL ALSO WORK TO BUILD AN ALLIANCE OF UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS AND WORK TOGETHER TO REDUCE OUR DEMAND , JUST LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS UNKNOWNWORD ON SUPPLY . AND AS WE DEVELOP NEW UNKNOWNWORD OF CLEAN ENERGY HERE AT HOME , WE WILL SHARE OUR TECHNOLOGY AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD WITH ALL THE NATIONS OF THE WORLD . IF WE CAN BUILD A CLEAN COAL PLANT IN AMERICA , CHINA SHOULD BE ABLE TO AS WELL . IF WE FIND A WAY TO HARNESS THE NEXT GENERATION OF BIOFUELS , INDIA WILL KNOW HOW TO DO IT TOO . AND AS WE TACKLE UNKNOWNWORD IN IMPOVERISHED NATIONS , WE WILL USE WHAT WE KNOW TO HELP THEM REDUCE THE NEGATIVE IMPACTS OF CLIMATE CHANGE AND BUILD A CLEAN ENERGY FUTURE . RECENTLY , THE DIRECTOR OF A UNKNOWNWORD THAT HELPS PROMOTE CLEAN ENERGY POLICIES IN CHINA SAID THAT THE MOST FREQUENT QUESTION HE GETS FROM THE CHINESE ABOUT EVERY POLICY INITIATIVE HE SUGGESTS IS , "IF IT IS SO GOOD , WHY AREN'T YOU DOING IT ?" AND IT'S THE HARDEST QUESTION TO ANSWER . HE SAID , "WE CAN POINT TO GOOD EXAMPLES THAT SOME AMERICAN STATES , OR CITIES , OR COMPANIES ARE UNKNOWNWORD WE CAN'T POINT TO AMERICA ." I BELIEVE IT'S TIME THE WORLD COULD POINT TO AMERICA AGAIN . I WANT THE UNKNOWNWORD IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT TO OUR GREEN BUILDINGS AS THE KIND HE'D LIKE TO DESIGN FOR HIS COUNTRY . I WANT THE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT TO OUR CARS AS THE MODEL FOR ALL THE WORLD . I WANT THE LEADERS OF EUROPE AND ASIA ; OF AFRICA AND SOUTH AMERICA TO POINT TO OUR DIPLOMACY AND OUR ENGAGEMENT AND OUR INGENUITY AS THE LIGHT THAT LED US TOWARD A NEW ENERGY FUTURE IN OUR TIME . AND MOST OF ALL , I WANT OUR CHILDREN AND OUR CHILDREN'S CHILDREN TO POINT TO THIS GENERATION AND THIS MOMENT AS THE TIME WHEN AMERICA FOUND ITS WAY AGAIN . AS THE TIME WHEN AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD THE DIVISION AND THE POLITICS AND THE PETTINESS OF AN EARLIER ERA SO THAT A NEW GENERATION COULD COME TOGETHER AND TAKE ON THE MOST URGENT CHALLENGE OF THIS ERA . I AM RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES TO LEAD US TOWARD THIS NEW ERA , AND I ASK ALL OF YOU TO JOIN ME IN TAKING ON THE CHALLENGE THAT LIES AHEAD . THANK YOU .
BLUE	THANK YOU , UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD TO A PRESIDENT IN SOME OF OUR TOUGHEST MOMENTS , AND HE HAS HELPED DEFINE OUR NATIONAL PURPOSE AT PIVOTAL TURNING POINTS . LET ME ALSO WELCOME ALL OF THE ELECTED OFFICIALS FROM ILLINOIS WHO ARE WITH US . LET ME GIVE A SPECIAL WELCOME TO ALL OF THE ORGANIZERS AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO JOINED ME TO RALLY AGAINST GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ FIVE YEARS AGO . AND I WANT TO THANK UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSITY AND UNKNOWNWORD STUDENTS FOR UNKNOWNWORD THIS EVENT . WE COME TOGETHER AT A TIME OF UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD . A NEW ACADEMIC YEAR HAS BEGUN . PROFESSORS ARE LEARNING THE NAMES OF NEW STUDENTS , AND STUDENTS ARE REMINDED THAT YOU ACTUALLY DO HAVE TO ATTEND CLASS . THAT COLD IS BEGINNING TO UNKNOWNWORD INTO THE CHICAGO AIR . THE SEASON IS CHANGING . UNKNOWNWORD IS NOW FILLED WITH STUDENTS WHO HAVE NOT SPENT A SINGLE DAY ON CAMPUS WITHOUT THE REALITY OF A WAR IN IRAQ . FOUR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD AND FOUR UNKNOWNWORD HAVE GRADUATED SINCE THIS WAR BEGAN . AND WE ARE REMINDED THAT AMERICA'S SONS AND DAUGHTERS IN UNIFORM , AND THEIR FAMILIES , BEAR THE HEAVY BURDEN . THE WIFE OF ONE SOLDIER FROM ILLINOIS WROTE TO ME AND SAID THAT HER HUSBAND UNKNOWNWORD LIKE HE'S UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ AND UNKNOWNWORD HOME ." THAT'S A TRAGIC STATEMENT . AND IT COULD BE ECHOED BY FAMILIES ACROSS OUR COUNTRY WHO HAVE SEEN LOVED ONES UNKNOWNWORD TO TOUR AFTER TOUR OF DUTY . YOU ARE STUDENTS . AND THE GREAT RESPONSIBILITY OF STUDENTS IS TO QUESTION THE WORLD AROUND YOU , TO QUESTION THINGS THAT DON'T ADD UP . WITH IRAQ , WE MUST ASK THE QUESTION : HOW DID WE GO SO WRONG ? THERE ARE THOSE WHO OFFER UP EASY ANSWERS . THEY WILL UNKNOWNWORD THAT IRAQ IS GEORGE BUSH'S WAR , IT'S ALL HIS FAULT . OR THAT IRAQ WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD AND INCOMPETENCE OF UNKNOWNWORD RUMSFELD AND DICK CHENEY . OR THAT WE WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IRAQ RIGHT IF WE WENT IN WITH MORE TROOPS , OR IF WE HAD A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , OR IF ONLY THERE WERE A STRONGER IRAQI PRIME MINISTER . THESE ARE THE EASY ANSWERS . AND LIKE MOST EASY ANSWERS , THEY ARE PARTIALLY TRUE . BUT THEY DON'T TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH , BECAUSE THEY UNKNOWNWORD A HARDER AND MORE FUNDAMENTAL TRUTH . THE HARD TRUTH IS THAT THE WAR IN IRAQ IS NOT ABOUT A UNKNOWNWORD OF MANY MISTAKES - IT IS ABOUT ONE BIG MISTAKE . THE WAR IN IRAQ SHOULD NEVER HAVE BEEN FOUGHT . FIVE YEARS AGO TODAY , I WAS ASKED TO SPEAK AT A RALLY AGAINST GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ . THE VOTE TO AUTHORIZE THE WAR IN CONGRESS WAS LESS THAN TEN DAYS AWAY AND I WAS A CANDIDATE FOR THE UNITED STATES SENATE . SOME FRIENDS OF MINE ADVISED ME TO KEEP QUIET . GOING TO WAR IN IRAQ , THEY UNKNOWNWORD OUT , WAS POPULAR . ALL THE OTHER MAJOR CANDIDATES WERE SUPPORTING THE WAR AT THE TIME . IF THE WAR GOES WELL , THEY SAID , YOU'LL HAVE UNKNOWNWORD YOUR POLITICAL CAREER AWAY . BUT I DIDN'T SEE HOW SADDAM HUSSEIN POSED AN IMMINENT THREAT . I WAS CONVINCED THAT A WAR WOULD DISTRACT US FROM AFGHANISTAN AND THE REAL THREAT FROM AL QAEDA . I WORRIED THAT IRAQ'S HISTORY OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD COULD LEAVE US UNKNOWNWORD DOWN IN A UNKNOWNWORD CONFLICT . AND I BELIEVED THE WAR WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF EXTREMISM AND LEAD TO NEW TERRORISM . SO I WENT TO THE RALLY . AND I ARGUED AGAINST A UNKNOWNWORD WAR " - A UNKNOWNWORD BASED NOT ON REASON , BUT ON POLITICS " - UNKNOWNWORD OCCUPATION OF UNDETERMINED LENGTH , WITH UNDETERMINED COSTS , AND UNDETERMINED CONSEQUENCES ." I WAS NOT ALONE . THOUGH NOT A MAJORITY , MILLIONS OF AMERICANS OPPOSED GIVING THE PRESIDENT THE AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR IN IRAQ . UNKNOWNWORD SENATORS , INCLUDING THE LEADER OF THE SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE , SHARED MY CONCERNS AND RESISTED THE MARCH TO WAR . FOR US , THE WAR DEFIED COMMON SENSE . AFTER ALL , THE PEOPLE WHO HIT US ON 9/11 WERE IN AFGHANISTAN , NOT IRAQ . BUT THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING IN WASHINGTON HAS A WAY OF BUYING INTO STORIES THAT MAKE POLITICAL SENSE EVEN IF THEY DON'T MAKE PRACTICAL SENSE . WE WERE TOLD THAT THE ONLY WAY TO PREVENT IRAQ FROM GETTING NUCLEAR WEAPONS WAS WITH MILITARY FORCE . SOME LEADING DEMOCRATS ECHOED THE ADMINISTRATION'S UNKNOWNWORD LINE THAT THERE WAS A CONNECTION BETWEEN SADDAM HUSSEIN AND AL QAEDA . WE WERE COUNSELED BY SOME OF THE MOST EXPERIENCED VOICES IN WASHINGTON THAT THE ONLY WAY FOR DEMOCRATS TO LOOK TOUGH WAS TO TALK , ACT AND VOTE LIKE A REPUBLICAN . AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OLD UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENT KENNEDY ONCE SAID - "THE PURSUIT OF PEACE IS NOT AS UNKNOWNWORD AS THE PURSUIT OF WAR - AND UNKNOWNWORD THE WORDS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD FALL ON UNKNOWNWORD EARS ." IN THE FALL OF 2002 , THOSE UNKNOWNWORD EARS WERE IN WASHINGTON . THEY UNKNOWNWORD TO A PRESIDENT WHO DIDN'T TELL THE WHOLE TRUTH TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ; WHO UNKNOWNWORD DIPLOMACY AND UNKNOWNWORD ALLIES ; AND WHO SQUANDERED OUR UNITY AND THE SUPPORT OF THE WORLD AFTER 9/11 . BUT IT DOESN'T END THERE . BECAUSE THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WEREN'T JUST FAILED BY A PRESIDENT - THEY WERE FAILED BY MUCH OF WASHINGTON . BY A MEDIA THAT TOO OFTEN REPORTED SPIN INSTEAD OF FACTS . BY A FOREIGN POLICY UNKNOWNWORD THAT LARGELY UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR WAR . AND MOST OF ALL BY THE MAJORITY OF A CONGRESS - A UNKNOWNWORD BRANCH OF GOVERNMENT - THAT VOTED TO GIVE THE PRESIDENT THE OPEN-ENDED AUTHORITY TO WAGE WAR THAT HE USES TO THIS DAY . LET'S BE CLEAR : WITHOUT THAT VOTE , THERE WOULD BE NO WAR . SOME SEEK TO UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY . THEY ARGUE THAT THEY WEREN'T REALLY VOTING FOR WAR , THEY WERE VOTING FOR INSPECTORS , OR FOR DIPLOMACY . BUT THE CONGRESS , THE ADMINISTRATION , THE MEDIA , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ALL UNDERSTOOD WHAT WE WERE DEBATING IN THE FALL OF 2002 . THIS WAS A VOTE ABOUT WHETHER OR NOT TO GO TO WAR . THAT'S THE TRUTH AS WE ALL UNDERSTOOD IT THEN , AND AS WE NEED TO UNDERSTAND IT NOW . AND WE NEED TO ASK THOSE WHO VOTED FOR THE WAR : HOW CAN YOU GIVE THE PRESIDENT A BLANK CHECK AND THEN ACT SURPRISED WHEN HE UNKNOWNWORD IT ? WITH ALL THAT WE KNOW ABOUT WHAT'S GONE WRONG IN IRAQ , EVEN TODAY'S DEBATE IS UNKNOWNWORD FROM REALITY . WE'VE GOT A SURGE THAT IS SOMEHOW DECLARED A SUCCESS EVEN THOUGH IT HAS FAILED TO ENABLE THE POLITICAL RECONCILIATION THAT WAS ITS STATED PURPOSE . THE FACT THAT VIOLENCE TODAY IS ONLY AS HORRIFIC AS IN 2006 IS HELD UP AS PROGRESS . WASHINGTON POLITICIANS AND PUNDITS UNKNOWNWORD OVER EACH OTHER TO DEBATE A NEWSPAPER UNKNOWNWORD WHILE OUR TROOPS FIGHT AND DIE IN IRAQ . AND THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING TODAY IS JUST AS UNKNOWNWORD AS IT WAS IN 2002 . THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT MEASURES EXPERIENCE ONLY BY THE YEARS YOU'VE BEEN IN WASHINGTON , NOT BY YOUR TIME SPENT SERVING IN THE WIDER WORLD . THIS IS THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT HAS TURNED AGAINST THE WAR , BUT NOT AGAINST THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT GOT US INTO THE WAR IN THE FIRST PLACE - THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD TO TALK OPENLY TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . WELL I'M NOT RUNNING FOR PRESIDENT TO CONFORM TO WASHINGTON'S CONVENTIONAL THINKING - I'M RUNNING TO CHALLENGE IT . I'M NOT RUNNING TO JOIN THE KIND OF WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD THAT LED US TO WAR IN IRAQ - I'M RUNNING TO CHANGE OUR POLITICS AND OUR POLICY SO WE CAN LEAVE THE WORLD A BETTER PLACE THAN OUR GENERATION HAS FOUND IT . SO THERE IS A CHOICE THAT HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS CAMPAIGN , ONE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE NEED TO UNDERSTAND . THEY SHOULD ASK THEMSELVES : WHO GOT THE SINGLE MOST IMPORTANT FOREIGN POLICY DECISION SINCE THE END OF THE COLD WAR RIGHT , AND WHO GOT IT WRONG . THIS IS NOT JUST A MATTER OF DEBATING THE PAST . IT'S ABOUT WHO HAS THE BEST JUDGMENT TO MAKE THE CRITICAL DECISIONS OF THE FUTURE . BECAUSE YOU MIGHT THINK THAT WASHINGTON WOULD LEARN FROM IRAQ . BUT WE'VE SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN JUST HOW BENT OUT OF SHAPE WASHINGTON GETS WHEN YOU CHALLENGE ITS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I SAID THAT AS PRESIDENT I WOULD LEAD DIRECT DIPLOMACY WITH OUR ADVERSARIES , I WAS CALLED UNKNOWNWORD AND IRRESPONSIBLE . BUT HOW ARE WE GOING TO TURN THE PAGE ON THE FAILED BUSH-CHENEY POLICY OF NOT TALKING TO OUR ADVERSARIES IF WE DON'T HAVE A PRESIDENT WHO WILL LEAD THAT DIPLOMACY ? WHEN I SAID THAT WE SHOULD TAKE OUT UNKNOWNWORD TERRORISTS LIKE OSAMA BIN LADEN IF WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE ABOUT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD , I WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY UNKNOWNWORD OF IRAQ WAR SUPPORTERS . THEY SAID WE CAN'T TAKE OUT BIN LADEN IF THE COUNTRY HE'S HIDING IN WON'T . A FEW WEEKS LATER , THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE 9/11 COMMISSION - TOM UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD - AGREED WITH MY POSITION . BUT FEW IN WASHINGTON SEEMED TO NOTICE . SOME PEOPLE MADE A DIFFERENT ARGUMENT ON THIS ISSUE . THEY SAID WE CAN TAKE OUT BIN LADEN , WE JUST CAN'T SAY THAT WE WILL . I REJECT THIS . I AM A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES , AND I BELIEVE THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A RIGHT TO KNOW WHERE I STAND . AND WHEN I SAID THAT WE CAN RULE OUT THE USE OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS TO TAKE OUT A TERRORIST TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD , IT WAS IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD " BECAUSE I DID NOT UNKNOWNWORD THE CONVENTIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . BUT IS THERE ANY MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WORLD WHO BELIEVES THAT WE NEED TO DROP A NUCLEAR BOMB ON A TERRORIST TRAINING UNKNOWNWORD ? WE NEED TO QUESTION THE WORLD AROUND US . WHEN WE HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT EXPERIENCE , WE CAN'T JUST DEBATE WHO HAS THE MOST EXPERIENCE SCORING POLITICAL POINTS . WHEN WE HAVE A DEBATE ABOUT EXPERIENCE , WE CAN'T JUST TALK ABOUT WHO FOUGHT UNKNOWNWORD BATTLES - WE HAVE TO FOCUS ON WHO CAN FACE THE CHALLENGES AND SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITIES OF TOMORROW . BECAUSE NO MATTER WHAT WE THINK ABOUT GEORGE BUSH , HE'S GOING TO BE GONE IN JANUARY 2009 . HE'S NOT ON THE BALLOT . THIS ELECTION IS ABOUT ENDING THE IRAQ WAR , BUT EVEN MORE IT'S ABOUT MOVING BEYOND IT . AND WE'RE NOT GOING BE SAFE IN A WORLD OF UNCONVENTIONAL THREATS WITH THE SAME OLD CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT GOT US INTO IRAQ . WE'RE NOT GOING TO UNIFY A DIVIDED AMERICA TO CONFRONT THESE THREATS WITH THE SAME OLD CONVENTIONAL POLITICS OF JUST TRYING TO BEAT THE OTHER SIDE . IN 2009 , WE WILL HAVE A UNKNOWNWORD OF OPPORTUNITY TO RENEW OUR GLOBAL LEADERSHIP AND BRING OUR NATION TOGETHER . IF WE DON'T SEIZE THAT MOMENT , WE MAY NOT GET ANOTHER . THIS ELECTION IS A TURNING POINT . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE GET TO DECIDE : ARE WE GOING TO TURN BACK THE UNKNOWNWORD , OR TURN THE PAGE ? I WANT TO BE STRAIGHT WITH YOU . IF YOU WANT CONVENTIONAL WASHINGTON THINKING , I'M NOT YOUR MAN . IF YOU WANT RIGID IDEOLOGY , I'M NOT YOUR MAN . IF YOU THINK THAT FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE CAN WAIT , I'M UNKNOWNWORD NOT YOUR MAN . BUT IF YOU WANT TO BRING THIS COUNTRY TOGETHER , IF YOU WANT EXPERIENCE THAT'S BROADER THAN JUST LEARNING THE WAYS OF WASHINGTON , IF YOU THINK THAT THE GLOBAL CHALLENGES WE FACE ARE TOO URGENT TO WAIT , AND IF YOU THINK THAT AMERICA MUST OFFER THE WORLD A NEW AND HOPEFUL FACE , THEN I OFFER A DIFFERENT CHOICE IN THIS RACE AND A DIFFERENT VISION FOR OUR FUTURE . THE FIRST THING WE HAVE TO DO IS END THIS WAR . AND THE RIGHT PERSON TO END IT IS SOMEONE WHO HAD THE JUDGMENT TO OPPOSE IT FROM THE BEGINNING . THERE IS NO MILITARY SOLUTION IN IRAQ , AND THERE NEVER WAS . I WILL BEGIN TO REMOVE OUR TROOPS FROM IRAQ IMMEDIATELY . I WILL REMOVE ONE OR TWO BRIGADES A MONTH , AND GET ALL OF OUR COMBAT TROOPS OUT OF IRAQ WITHIN 16 MONTHS . THE ONLY TROOPS I WILL KEEP IN IRAQ WILL PERFORM THE LIMITED UNKNOWNWORD OF PROTECTING OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OUT TARGETED STRIKES ON AL QAEDA . AND I WILL LAUNCH THE DIPLOMATIC AND UNKNOWNWORD INITIATIVES THAT ARE SO BADLY NEEDED . LET THERE BE NO DOUBT : I WILL END THIS WAR . BUT IT'S ALSO TIME TO LEARN THE LESSONS OF IRAQ . WE'RE NOT GOING TO DEFEAT THE THREATS OF THE 21ST CENTURY ON A CONVENTIONAL BATTLEFIELD . WE CANNOT WIN A FIGHT FOR HEARTS AND MINDS WHEN WE OUTSOURCE CRITICAL UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD CONTRACTORS . WE'RE NOT GOING TO WIN A BATTLE OF IDEAS WITH UNKNOWNWORD ALONE . MAKE NO MISTAKE : WE MUST ALWAYS BE PREPARED TO USE FORCE TO PROTECT AMERICA . BUT THE BEST WAY TO KEEP AMERICA SAFE IS NOT TO THREATEN TERRORISTS WITH NUCLEAR WEAPONS - IT'S TO KEEP NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND NUCLEAR MATERIALS AWAY FROM TERRORISTS . THAT'S WHY I'VE WORKED WITH REPUBLICAN SENATOR DICK UNKNOWNWORD TO PASS A LAW UNKNOWNWORD OUR PURSUIT OF LOOSE NUCLEAR MATERIALS . AND THAT'S WHY I'LL LEAD A GLOBAL EFFORT TO SECURE ALL LOOSE NUCLEAR MATERIALS DURING MY FIRST TERM IN OFFICE . BUT WE NEED TO DO MUCH MORE . WE NEED TO CHANGE OUR NUCLEAR POLICY AND OUR UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH IS STILL FOCUSED ON UNKNOWNWORD THE SOVIET UNION - A COUNTRY THAT DOESN'T EXIST . MEANWHILE , INDIA AND PAKISTAN AND NORTH KOREA HAVE JOINED THE CLUB OF UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS , AND IRAN IS KNOCKING ON THE DOOR . MORE NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONS MEAN MORE DANGER TO US ALL . HERE'S WHAT I'LL SAY AS PRESIDENT : AMERICA SEEKS A WORLD IN WHICH THERE ARE NO NUCLEAR WEAPONS . WE WILL NOT PURSUE UNILATERAL DISARMAMENT . AS LONG AS NUCLEAR WEAPONS EXIST , WE'LL RETAIN A STRONG NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD . BUT WE'LL KEEP OUR COMMITMENT UNDER THE NUCLEAR UNKNOWNWORD PROLIFERATION TREATY ON THE LONG ROAD UNKNOWNWORD ELIMINATING NUCLEAR WEAPONS . WE'LL WORK WITH RUSSIA TO TAKE U.S . AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OFF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND TO DRAMATICALLY REDUCE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR NUCLEAR WEAPONS AND MATERIAL . WE'LL START BY SEEKING A GLOBAL BAN ON THE PRODUCTION OF UNKNOWNWORD MATERIAL FOR WEAPONS . AND WE'LL SET A GOAL TO EXPAND THE UNKNOWNWORD BAN ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THE AGREEMENT IS GLOBAL . AS WE DO THIS , WE'LL BE IN A BETTER POSITION TO LEAD THE WORLD IN UNKNOWNWORD THE RULES OF THE ROAD IF WE FIRMLY UNKNOWNWORD BY THOSE RULES . IT'S TIME TO STOP GIVING COUNTRIES LIKE IRAN AND NORTH KOREA AN EXCUSE . IT'S TIME FOR AMERICA TO LEAD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL STRENGTHEN THE NUCLEAR NON-PROLIFERATION TREATY SO THAT NATIONS THAT DON'T UNKNOWNWORD WILL AUTOMATICALLY FACE STRONG INTERNATIONAL SANCTIONS . THIS WILL REQUIRE A NEW ERA OF AMERICAN DIPLOMACY . TO UNKNOWNWORD THE DAWN OF THAT ERA , WE NEED A PRESIDENT WHO IS WILLING TO TALK TO ALL NATIONS , FRIEND AND FOE . I'M NOT AFRAID THAT AMERICA WILL LOSE A UNKNOWNWORD BATTLE WITH A PETTY UNKNOWNWORD - WE NEED TO GO BEFORE THE WORLD AND WIN THOSE BATTLES . IF WE TAKE THE ATTITUDE THAT THE PRESIDENT JUST PARACHUTES IN FOR A UNKNOWNWORD AFTER AN AGREEMENT HAS ALREADY BEEN REACHED , THEN WE'RE ONLY GOING TO REACH AGREEMENTS WITH OUR FRIENDS . THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO PROTECT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . THAT'S NOT THE WAY TO ADVANCE OUR INTERESTS . JUST LOOK AT OUR HISTORY . KENNEDY HAD A DIRECT LINE TO UNKNOWNWORD . NIXON MET WITH UNKNOWNWORD . CARTER DID THE HARD WORK OF NEGOTIATING THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . REAGAN WAS NEGOTIATING ARMS AGREEMENTS WITH GORBACHEV EVEN AS HE CALLED ON HIM TO UNKNOWNWORD DOWN THIS WALL ." IT'S TIME TO MAKE DIPLOMACY A TOP PRIORITY . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WE NEED TO OPEN THEM IN THE TOUGH AND HOPELESS CORNERS OF THE WORLD . INSTEAD OF HAVING MORE AMERICANS SERVING IN MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD THAN THE DIPLOMATIC CORPS , WE NEED TO GROW OUR FOREIGN SERVICE . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE WORLD , I WILL PERSONALLY LEAD A NEW CHAPTER OF AMERICAN ENGAGEMENT . IT IS TIME TO OFFER THE WORLD A MESSAGE OF HOPE TO COUNTER THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HATE . MY EXPERIENCE HAS BROUGHT ME TO THE HOPELESS PLACES . AS A BOY , I LIVED IN INDONESIA AND PLAYED UNKNOWNWORD WITH CHILDREN WHO COULD NOT DREAM THE SAME DREAMS THAT I DID . AS AN ADULT , I'VE RETURNED TO BE WITH MY FAMILY IN THEIR SMALL VILLAGE IN KENYA , WHERE THE PROMISE OF AMERICA IS STILL AN INSPIRATION . AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER , I WORKED IN SOUTH SIDE NEIGHBORHOODS THAT HAD BEEN LEFT BEHIND BY GLOBAL CHANGE . AS A SENATOR , I'VE BEEN TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD WHERE PROUD AND DIGNIFIED PEOPLE CAN'T HOPE FOR ANYTHING BEYOND THE NEXT UNKNOWNWORD . IN THE 21ST CENTURY , PROGRESS MUST MEAN MORE THAN A VOTE AT THE BALLOT UNKNOWNWORD - IT MUST MEAN FREEDOM FROM FEAR AND FREEDOM FROM WANT . WE CANNOT STAND FOR THE FREEDOM OF UNKNOWNWORD . NOR CAN WE SUPPORT THE GLOBALIZATION OF THE EMPTY UNKNOWNWORD . WE NEED NEW APPROACHES TO HELP PEOPLE TO HELP THEMSELVES . THE UNITED NATIONS HAS EMBRACED THE UNKNOWNWORD DEVELOPMENT GOALS , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD TO CUT EXTREME POVERTY IN HALF BY 2015 . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THEY WILL BE AMERICA'S GOALS . THE BUSH ADMINISTRATION TRIED TO KEEP THE UN FROM UNKNOWNWORD THESE GOALS ; THE OBAMA ADMINISTRATION WILL DOUBLE FOREIGN ASSISTANCE TO $50 BILLION TO LEAD THE WORLD TO ACHIEVE THEM . IN THE 21ST CENTURY , WE CANNOT STAND UP BEFORE THE WORLD AND SAY THAT THERE'S ONE SET OF RULES FOR AMERICA AND ANOTHER FOR EVERYONE ELSE . TO LEAD THE WORLD , WE MUST LEAD BY EXAMPLE . WE MUST BE WILLING TO ACKNOWLEDGE OUR FAILINGS , NOT JUST UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL REJECT TORTURE - WITHOUT EXCEPTION OR UNKNOWNWORD ; WE'LL CLOSE GUANTANAMO ; WE'LL BE THE COUNTRY THAT UNKNOWNWORD TELLS THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE PRISON UNKNOWNWORD AROUND THE WORLD THAT AMERICA IS YOUR VOICE , AMERICA IS YOUR DREAM , AMERICA IS YOUR LIGHT OF JUSTICE . WE CANNOT - WE MUST NOT - LET THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR VALUES BE A UNKNOWNWORD OF THE IRAQ WAR . BUT WE CANNOT SECURE AMERICA AND SHOW OUR BEST FACE TO THE WORLD UNLESS WE CHANGE HOW WE DO BUSINESS IN WASHINGTON . WE ALL KNOW WHAT IRAQ HAS COST US ABROAD . BUT THESE LAST FEW YEARS WE'VE SEEN AN UNACCEPTABLE ABUSE OF POWER AT HOME . WE FACE REAL THREATS . ANY PRESIDENT NEEDS THE UNKNOWNWORD TO CONFRONT THEM UNKNOWNWORD AND SURELY . BUT WE'VE PAID A HEAVY PRICE FOR HAVING A PRESIDENT WHOSE PRIORITY IS EXPANDING HIS OWN POWER . THE CONSTITUTION IS TREATED LIKE A UNKNOWNWORD . MATTERS OF WAR AND PEACE ARE USED AS POLITICAL TOOLS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER SIDE . WE GET UNKNOWNWORD TO ENDLESS SPIN TO KEEP OUR TROOPS AT WAR , BUT WE DON'T GET TO SEE THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR HEROES COMING HOME . WE GET SECRET TASK FORCES , SECRET UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD INTELLIGENCE , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PEOPLE WHO SPEAK OUT AGAINST THE PRESIDENT'S POLICIES . ALL OF THIS HAS LEFT US WHERE WE ARE TODAY : MORE DIVIDED , MORE UNKNOWNWORD , MORE IN DEBT , AND MIRED IN AN ENDLESS WAR . A WAR TO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD HAS BECOME AN OPEN-ENDED OCCUPATION OF A FOREIGN COUNTRY . THIS IS NOT AMERICA . THIS IS NOT WHO WE ARE . IT'S TIME FOR US TO STAND UP AND TELL GEORGE BUSH THAT THE GOVERNMENT IN THIS COUNTRY IS NOT BASED ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE PERSON , THE GOVERNMENT IS OF THE PEOPLE , BY THE PEOPLE AND FOR THE PEOPLE . WE THOUGHT WE LEARNED THIS LESSON . AFTER VIETNAM , CONGRESS UNKNOWNWORD IT WOULD NEVER AGAIN BE UNKNOWNWORD INTO WAR , AND EVEN WROTE A NEW LAW -- THE WAR POWERS ACT -- TO ENSURE IT WOULD NOT UNKNOWNWORD ITS MISTAKES . BUT NO LAW CAN FORCE A CONGRESS TO STAND UP TO THE PRESIDENT . NO LAW CAN MAKE SENATORS READ THE INTELLIGENCE THAT SHOWED THE PRESIDENT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THE CASE FOR WAR . NO LAW CAN GIVE CONGRESS A BACKBONE IF IT UNKNOWNWORD TO STAND UP AS THE UNKNOWNWORD BRANCH THE CONSTITUTION MADE IT . THAT IS WHY IT IS NOT ENOUGH TO CHANGE PARTIES . IT IS TIME TO CHANGE OUR POLITICS . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO PUTS POLITICS AND LOYALTY OVER UNKNOWNWORD . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO THINKS BIG BUT DOESN'T FEEL THE NEED TO TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHAT THEY THINK . WE DON'T NEED ANOTHER PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE DOOR ON THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WHEN THEY MAKE POLICY . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM IN THIS COUNTRY - THEY ARE THE ANSWER . AND IT'S TIME WE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO UNKNOWNWORD LIKE THAT . I WILL ALWAYS TELL THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THE TRUTH . I WILL ALWAYS TELL YOU WHERE I STAND . IT'S WHAT I'M DOING IN THIS CAMPAIGN . IT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . I'LL LEAD A NEW ERA OF UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL GIVE AN ANNUAL UNKNOWNWORD OF THE WORLD " ADDRESS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE IN WHICH I UNKNOWNWORD OUT OUR NATIONAL SECURITY POLICY . I'LL DRAW ON THE LEGACY OF ONE OUR GREATEST PRESIDENTS - FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT - AND GIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ," AND I'LL HAVE MEMBERS OF MY NATIONAL SECURITY TEAM DO THE SAME . I'LL TURN THE PAGE ON A GROWING EMPIRE OF UNKNOWNWORD INFORMATION , AND RESTORE THE BALANCE WE'VE LOST BETWEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD SECRET AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD IN A DEMOCRATIC SOCIETY BY CREATING A NEW NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD CENTER . WE'LL PROTECT SOURCES AND UNKNOWNWORD , BUT WE WON'T USE SOURCES AND UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD TO HIDE THE TRUTH . OUR HISTORY DOESN'T BELONG TO WASHINGTON , IT BELONGS TO AMERICA . I'LL USE THE INTELLIGENCE THAT I DO RECEIVE TO MAKE GOOD POLICY - I WON'T UNKNOWNWORD IT TO SELL A BAD POLICY . WE DON'T NEED ANY MORE OFFICIALS WHO TELL THE PRESIDENT WHAT THEY WANT TO HEAR . I WILL MAKE THE DIRECTOR OF NATIONAL INTELLIGENCE AN OFFICIAL WITH A UNKNOWNWORD TERM , LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE FEDERAL RESERVE - NOT SOMEONE WHO CAN BE FIRED BY THE PRESIDENT . WE NEED UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AT THE TOP OF OUR INTELLIGENCE AGENCIES . WE DON'T NEED POLITICS . MY TEST WON'T BE LOYALTY - IT WILL BE THE TRUTH . AND I'LL TURN THE PAGE ON THE UNKNOWNWORD PRESIDENCY THAT UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL SECURITY AS A PARTISAN ISSUE - NOT AN AMERICAN ISSUE . I WILL CALL FOR A STANDING , BIPARTISAN UNKNOWNWORD GROUP OF CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS ON NATIONAL SECURITY . I WILL MEET WITH THIS UNKNOWNWORD GROUP EVERY MONTH , AND UNKNOWNWORD WITH THEM BEFORE TAKING MAJOR MILITARY ACTION . THE BUCK WILL STOP WITH ME . BUT THESE DISCUSSIONS HAVE TO TAKE PLACE ON A BIPARTISAN UNKNOWNWORD , AND SUPPORT FOR THESE DECISIONS WILL BE STRONGER IF THEY DRAW ON BIPARTISAN COUNSEL . WE'RE NOT GOING TO SECURE THIS COUNTRY UNLESS WE TURN THE PAGE ON THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT SAYS POLITICS IS JUST ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD THE OTHER SIDE . IT'S TIME TO UNITE AMERICA , BECAUSE WE ARE AT AN URGENT AND PIVOTAL MOMENT . THERE ARE THOSE WHO SUGGEST THAT THERE ARE EASY ANSWERS TO THE CHALLENGES WE FACE . WE CAN LOOK , THEY SAY , TO WASHINGTON EXPERIENCE - THE SAME EXPERIENCE THAT GOT US INTO THIS WAR . OR WE CAN TURN THE PAGE TO SOMETHING NEW , TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY AND TO SEIZE THIS MOMENT . I AM NOT A PERFECT MAN AND I WON'T BE A PERFECT PRESIDENT . BUT MY OWN AMERICAN STORY TELLS ME THAT THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD FORWARD WHEN WE UNKNOWNWORD OFF OUR DOUBTS AND SEEK NEW BEGINNINGS . IT'S WHAT BROUGHT MY FATHER ACROSS AN OCEAN IN SEARCH OF A DREAM . IT'S WHAT I SAW IN THE EYES OF MEN AND WOMEN AND CHILDREN IN INDONESIA WHO HEARD THE WORD " AMERICA " AND THOUGHT OF THE POSSIBILITY BEYOND THE UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S WHAT I SAW IN THE STREETS OF THE SOUTH SIDE , WHEN PEOPLE WHO HAD EVERY REASON TO GIVE IN DECIDED TO PICK THEMSELVES UP . IT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THE UNITED STATES SENATE WHEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS OF GOOD WILL DO COME TOGETHER TO TAKE ON TOUGH ISSUES . AND IT'S WHAT I'VE SEEN IN THIS CAMPAIGN , WHEN OVER HALF A MILLION AMERICANS HAVE COME TOGETHER TO SEEK THE CHANGE THIS COUNTRY NEEDS . NOW I KNOW THAT SOME WILL SHAKE THEIR HEADS . IT'S EASY TO BE CYNICAL . WHEN IT COMES TO OUR FOREIGN POLICY , YOU GET IT FROM ALL SIDES . SOME FOLKS ON THE RIGHT WILL TELL YOU THAT YOU DON'T LOVE YOUR COUNTRY IF YOU DON'T SUPPORT THE WAR IN IRAQ . SOME FOLKS ON THE LEFT WILL TELL YOU THAT AMERICA CAN DO NO RIGHT IN THE WORLD . SOME UNKNOWNWORD THEIR SHOULDERS BECAUSE WASHINGTON SAYS , UNKNOWNWORD US , WE'LL TAKE CARE OF IT ." AND WE KNOW HAPPENED THE LAST TIME THEY SAID THAT . YES , IT'S EASY TO BE CYNICAL . BUT RIGHT NOW , SOMEWHERE IN IRAQ , THERE'S SOMEONE ABOUT YOUR AGE . HE'S MAYBE ON HIS SECOND OR THIRD TOUR . IT'S HOT . HE WOULD RATHER BE AT HOME . BUT HE'S IN HIS UNIFORM , GOT HIS COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD ON . HE'S GETTING IN A UNKNOWNWORD . HE'S GOING OUT ON PATROL . HE'S LOST A UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS WAR , MAYBE MORE . HE RISKED HIS LIFE YESTERDAY , HE'S UNKNOWNWORD HIS LIFE TODAY , AND HE'S GOING TO RISK IT TOMORROW . SO WHY DO WE REJECT THE CYNICISM ? WE REJECT IT BECAUSE OF MEN AND WOMEN LIKE HIM . WE REJECT IT BECAUSE THE LEGACY OF THEIR SACRIFICE MUST BE A BETTER AMERICA . WE REJECT IT BECAUSE THEY EMBODY THE SPIRIT OF THOSE WHO FOUGHT TO FREE THE SLAVES AND FREE A CONTINENT FROM A UNKNOWNWORD ; WHO UNKNOWNWORD EUROPE AND SENT PEACE CORPS VOLUNTEERS AROUND THE GLOBE ; BECAUSE THEY ARE FIGHTING FOR A BETTER AMERICA AND A BETTER WORLD . AND I REJECT IT BECAUSE I WOULDN'T BE ON THIS STAGE IF , THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY , AMERICA HAD NOT MADE THE RIGHT CHOICE OVER THE EASY CHOICE , THE AMBITIOUS CHOICE OVER THE UNKNOWNWORD CHOICE . I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF I DIDN'T THINK WE WERE READY TO MOVE PAST THE FIGHTS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AND THE 1990S . I WOULDN'T BE HERE IF , TIME AND AGAIN , THE UNKNOWNWORD HAD NOT BEEN PASSED TO A NEW GENERATION - TO UNITE THIS COUNTRY AT HOME , TO SHOW A NEW FACE OF THIS COUNTRY TO THE WORLD . I'M RUNNING FOR THE PRESIDENCY OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA SO THAT TOGETHER WE CAN DO THE HARD WORK TO SEEK A NEW DAWN OF PEACE AND PROSPERITY FOR OUR CHILDREN , AND FOR THE CHILDREN OF THE WORLD .
BLUE	 IT'S A PRIVILEGE TO BE A PART OF TODAY'S UNKNOWNWORD AND AN HONOR TO RECEIVE THIS DEGREE FROM UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE FEW OTHER UNIVERSITIES THAT HAVE PLAYED SO CENTRAL A ROLE IN BREAKING DOWN UNKNOWNWORD BARRIERS AND UNKNOWNWORD THIS COUNTRY CLOSER TO THE IDEALS WE SEE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE UNKNOWNWORD THROUGHOUT THIS CITY . IT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT SENT THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN TO THE UNITED STATES SENATE . IT WAS UNKNOWNWORD THAT GRADUATED THE FIRST AFRICAN-AMERICAN TO BECOME GOVERNOR AND THE FIRST TO BECOME MAYOR OF THE LARGEST CITY IN THE COUNTRY . IT WAS HERE , WITHIN THE HALLS OF THIS CAMPUS , WHERE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD MINDS OF HIS DAY TO CRAFT THE ARGUMENTS IN BROWN V . BOARD THAT UNKNOWNWORD A MOVEMENT THAT CHANGED THE WORLD . AND IT IS BECAUSE OF THESE UNKNOWNWORD THAT A BLACK MAN NAMED BARACK OBAMA CAN STAND BEFORE YOU TODAY AS A CANDIDATE FOR PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . BUT I AM NOT JUST RUNNING TO MAKE HISTORY . I'M RUNNING BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT TOGETHER , WE CAN CHANGE HISTORY'S COURSE . IT'S NOT ENOUGH JUST TO LOOK BACK IN WONDER OF HOW FAR WE'VE COME - I WANT US TO LOOK AHEAD WITH A FIERCE URGENCY AT HOW FAR WE HAVE LEFT TO GO . I BELIEVE IT'S TIME FOR THIS GENERATION TO MAKE ITS OWN MARK - TO WRITE OUR OWN CHAPTER IN THE AMERICAN STORY . AFTER ALL , THOSE WHO CAME BEFORE US DID NOT STRIKE A UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST INJUSTICE ONLY SO THAT WE WOULD ALLOW INJUSTICE TO UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR TIME . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DID NOT ARGUE BROWN SO THAT WE WOULD ACCEPT A COUNTRY WHERE TOO MANY AFRICAN-AMERICAN MEN END UP IN PRISON BECAUSE WE'D RATHER SPEND MORE TO JAIL A UNKNOWNWORD THAN TO EDUCATE A UNKNOWNWORD . DR . KING DID NOT TAKE US TO THE MOUNTAINTOP SO THAT WE WOULD ALLOW A TERRIBLE STORM TO UNKNOWNWORD THOSE WHO WERE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD ; HE WOULD NOT HAVE EXPECTED THAT IT WOULD TAKE A BREACH IN OUR LEVEES TO REVEAL A BREACH IN OUR COMPASSION ; THAT IT WOULD TAKE A HURRICANE TO REVEAL THE HUNGRY GOD ASKS US TO FEED ; THE SICK HE ASKS US TO CARE FOR ; THE LEAST OF THESE HE COMMANDS US TO TREAT AS OUR OWN . THE TEENAGERS AND COLLEGE STUDENTS WHO LEFT THEIR HOMES TO MARCH IN THE STREETS OF BIRMINGHAM AND MONTGOMERY ; THE MOTHERS WHO WALKED INSTEAD OF TAKING THE BUS AFTER A LONG DAY OF DOING SOMEBODY ELSE'S UNKNOWNWORD AND CLEANING SOMEBODY ELSE'S KITCHEN - THEY DIDN'T BRAVE FIRE HOSES AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SO THAT THEIR GRANDCHILDREN AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WOULD STILL WONDER AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY WHETHER THEIR VOTE WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD ; WHETHER THEIR CIVIL RIGHTS WOULD BE PROTECTED BY THEIR GOVERNMENT ; WHETHER JUSTICE WOULD BE EQUAL AND OPPORTUNITY WOULD BE THEIRS . AND I AM CERTAIN THAT NINE CHILDREN DID NOT WALK THROUGH THE DOORS OF A SCHOOL IN LITTLE ROCK SO THAT OUR CHILDREN WOULD HAVE TO SEE NOOSES UNKNOWNWORD AT A SCHOOL IN UNKNOWNWORD . WE HAVE MORE WORK TO DO . IT'S A UNKNOWNWORD REMINDER THAT THE UNKNOWNWORD ANNIVERSARY OF LITTLE ROCK FELL ON THIS WEEK . BECAUSE WHEN THE DOORS TO THAT SCHOOL FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD , A NATION RESPONDED . THE PRESIDENT SENT THE UNITED STATES ARMY TO STAND ON THE SIDE OF JUSTICE . THE CONGRESS PASSED THE CIVIL RIGHTS ACT OF 1957 . THE DEPARTMENT OF JUSTICE CREATED A CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION . AND MILLIONS OF AMERICANS TOOK TO THE STREETS IN THE FOLLOWING MONTHS AND YEARS SO THAT MORE CHILDREN COULD WALK THROUGH MORE DOORS . THESE WERE NOT EASY CHOICES TO MAKE AT THE TIME . PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD WAS WARNED BY SOME THAT SENDING THE ARMY DOWN TO LITTLE ROCK WOULD BE POLITICAL SUICIDE . THE RESISTANCE TO CIVIL RIGHTS REFORM WAS FIERCE . AND WE KNOW THAT THOSE WHO MARCHED FOR FREEDOM DID SO AT GREAT RISK TO THEMSELVES AND THEIR FAMILIES . BUT THEY DID IT BECAUSE THEY UNDERSTOOD THAT SOMETIMES THERE ARE MOMENTS WHEN WHAT'S TRULY RISKY IS NOT TO ACT . WHAT'S TRULY RISKY IS TO LET THE SAME INJUSTICE REMAIN YEAR AFTER YEAR . WHAT'S TRULY RISKY IS TO WALK AWAY AND PRETEND IT NEVER HAPPENED . WHAT'S TRULY RISKY IS TO ACCEPT THINGS AS THEY ARE INSTEAD OF WORKING FOR WHAT COULD BE . IN A UNKNOWNWORD CULTURE THAT'S MORE UNKNOWNWORD WITH WHO'S UNKNOWNWORD WHO IN WASHINGTON AND HOW LONG UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IS GOING TO JAIL , THESE MOMENTS ARE HARDER TO UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . BUT EVERY SO OFTEN , THEY DO APPEAR . SOMETIMES IT TAKES A HURRICANE . AND SOMETIMES IT TAKES A UNKNOWNWORD OF JUSTICE LIKE THE ONE WE'VE SEEN IN JENA , UNKNOWNWORD . THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL MAKE JENA ABOUT THE FIGHT ITSELF . AND IT'S TRUE THAT WE HAVE TO DO MORE AS PARENTS TO UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR CHILDREN THAT VIOLENCE IS ALWAYS WRONG . IT'S WRONG WHEN IT HAPPENS ON THE STREETS OF CHICAGO AND IT'S WRONG WHEN IT HAPPENS AT A SCHOOLYARD IN UNKNOWNWORD . VIOLENCE IS NOT THE ANSWER . UNKNOWNWORD WAS THE SOUL OF THE CIVIL RIGHTS MOVEMENT , AND WE HAVE TO DO A BETTER JOB OF TEACHING OUR CHILDREN THAT VIRTUE . BUT WE ALSO KNOW THAT TO TRULY UNDERSTAND JENA , YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT WHAT HAPPENED BOTH BEFORE AND AFTER THAT FIGHT . YOU HAVE TO LISTEN TO THE HATEFUL UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH THE HALLS OF A SCHOOL . YOU HAVE TO KNOW THE FULL MEASURE OF THE DAMAGE DONE BY THAT UNKNOWNWORD . YOU HAVE TO LOOK AT THOSE NOOSES UNKNOWNWORD ON THAT SCHOOLYARD TREE . AND YOU HAVE TO UNDERSTAND HOW BADLY OUR SYSTEM OF JUSTICE FAILED THOSE SIX BOYS IN THE DAYS AFTER THAT FIGHT - THE UNKNOWNWORD CHARGES ; THE UNKNOWNWORD AND EXCESSIVE SENTENCES ; THE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD WHO DID NOT CALL A SINGLE WITNESS . LIKE KATRINA DID WITH POVERTY , JENA UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT WERE AROUND LONG BEFORE THAT SCHOOLYARD FIGHT BROKE OUT . IT REMINDS US OF THE FACT THAT WE HAVE A SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD AWAY TOO MANY YOUNG , UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE BETTER PART OF THEIR LIVES - A DECISION THAT'S MADE NOT BY A JUDGE IN A UNKNOWNWORD , BUT BY POLITICIANS IN WASHINGTON . IT REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE CERTAIN SENTENCES THAT ARE BASED LESS ON THE KIND OF CRIME YOU COMMIT THAN ON WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE AND WHERE YOU COME FROM . IT REMINDS US THAT WE HAVE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHOSE IDEA OF UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD IS TRYING TO ROLLBACK UNKNOWNWORD ACTION PROGRAMS AT OUR COLLEGE AND UNIVERSITIES ; A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT WHOSE IDEA OF UNKNOWNWORD VOTING RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD IS TO LOOK FOR VOTING FRAUD IN BLACK AND LATINO COMMUNITIES WHERE IT DOESN'T EXIST . WE KNOW THESE UNKNOWNWORD ARE THERE . WE KNOW THEY'RE WRONG . AND YET THEY GO LARGELY UNKNOWNWORD UNTIL PEOPLE FIND THE COURAGE TO STAND UP AND SAY THEY'RE WRONG . UNTIL SOMEONE FINALLY SAYS , "IT'S WRONG THAT SCOOTER LIBBY GETS NO JAIL TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD OUR NATIONAL SECURITY , BUT A UNKNOWNWORD HONOR STUDENT IS STILL SITTING IN A GEORGIA PRISON FOR SOMETHING THAT WASN'T EVEN A UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WRONG ." IT'S NOT ALWAYS EASY TO STAND UP AND SAY THIS . I UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF YOU HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAVE SPOKEN OUT ON JENA 6 OR TRAVELED TO THE RALLY IN UNKNOWNWORD . I UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF YOU WHO'VE SPOKEN OUT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CASE . I KNOW IT CAN BE LONELY UNKNOWNWORD THIS KIND OF INJUSTICE . I KNOW THERE'S NOT A LOT OF UNKNOWNWORD IN IT . WHEN I WAS A STATE SENATOR IN ILLINOIS , WE HAD A DEATH PENALTY SYSTEM THAT HAD SENT UNKNOWNWORD INNOCENT PEOPLE TO DEATH UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD INNOCENT MEN - THAT WE KNOW OF . I WANTED TO REFORM THE SYSTEM . AND I WAS TOLD BY ALMOST EVERYONE THAT IT WASN'T POSSIBLE . THAT I WOULDN'T BE ABLE TO GET POLICE OFFICERS AND CIVIL RIGHTS ADVOCATES ; DEMOCRATS AND REPUBLICANS TO ALL AGREE THAT WE SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO MAKE SURE THEY WEREN'T UNKNOWNWORD . FOLKS TOLD ME THAT THERE WAS TOO MUCH POLITICAL RISK INVOLVED . BUT I BELIEVED THAT IT WAS TOO RISKY NOT TO ACT . AND AFTER AWHILE PEOPLE WITH UNKNOWNWORD VIEWS CAME TOGETHER AND STARTED LISTENING . AND WE ENDED UP REFORMING THAT DEATH PENALTY SYSTEM . AND WE DID THE SAME THING WHEN I PASSED A LAW TO UNKNOWNWORD RACIAL PROFILING . SO DON'T EVER LET ANYONE TELL YOU THAT CHANGE ISN'T POSSIBLE . DON'T LET THEM TELL YOU THAT SPEAKING OUT AND STANDING UP AGAINST INJUSTICE IS TOO RISKY . WHAT'S TOO RISKY IS KEEPING QUIET . WHAT'S TOO RISKY IS LOOKING THE OTHER WAY . I DON'T WANT TO BE STANDING HERE AND TALKING ABOUT ANOTHER JENA FOUR YEARS FROM NOW BECAUSE WE DIDN'T HAVE THE COURAGE TO ACT TODAY . I DON'T WANT THIS TO BE ANOTHER ISSUE THAT ENDS UP BEING IGNORED ONCE THE CAMERAS ARE TURNED OFF AND THE HEADLINES DISAPPEAR . IT'S TIME TO SEEK A NEW DAWN OF JUSTICE IN AMERICA . FROM THE DAY I TAKE OFFICE AS PRESIDENT , AMERICA WILL HAVE A JUSTICE DEPARTMENT THAT IS TRULY DEDICATED TO THE WORK IT BEGAN IN THE DAYS AFTER LITTLE ROCK . I WILL UNKNOWNWORD THE DEPARTMENT OF UNKNOWNWORD AND POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD , AND FOR THE FIRST TIME IN EIGHT YEARS , THE CIVIL RIGHTS DIVISION WILL ACTUALLY BE UNKNOWNWORD WITH CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYERS WHO PROSECUTE CIVIL RIGHTS UNKNOWNWORD , AND EMPLOYMENT DISCRIMINATION , AND HATE CRIMES . AND WE'LL HAVE A VOTING RIGHTS SECTION THAT ACTUALLY DEFENDS THE RIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN TO VOTE WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN UNKNOWNWORD ARE PLACED IN OUR NEIGHBORHOODS TELLING PEOPLE TO VOTE ON THE WRONG DAY , THAT WON'T ONLY BE AN INJUSTICE , IT WILL BE A CRIME . AS PRESIDENT , I WILL ALSO WORK EVERY DAY TO ENSURE THAT THIS COUNTRY HAS A CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM THAT UNKNOWNWORD TRUST AND CONFIDENCE IN EVERY AMERICAN , REGARDLESS OF AGE , OR RACE , OR BACKGROUND . THERE'S NO REASON THAT EVERY SINGLE PERSON UNKNOWNWORD OF A CRIME SHOULDN'T HAVE A QUALIFIED PUBLIC ATTORNEY TO DEFEND THEM . WE'LL RECRUIT MORE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD TO THE PROFESSION BY UNKNOWNWORD COLLEGE AND LAW SCHOOL LOANS - AND I WILL ASK SOME OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MINDS HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THAT OFFER . THERE'S ALSO NO REASON WE CAN'T PASS A RACIAL PROFILING LAW LIKE I DID IN ILLINOIS , OR ENCOURAGE STATE TO REFORM THE DEATH PENALTY SO THAT INNOCENT PEOPLE DO NOT END UP ON DEATH UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE WILL NO LONGER ACCEPT THE FALSE CHOICE BETWEEN BEING TOUGH ON CRIME AND VIGILANT IN OUR PURSUIT OF JUSTICE . DR . KING SAID IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD , IT'S UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN HAVE A CRIME POLICY THAT'S BOTH TOUGH AND SMART . IF YOU'RE UNKNOWNWORD OF A CRIME UNKNOWNWORD DRUGS , OF COURSE YOU SHOULD BE PUNISHED . BUT LET'S NOT MAKE THE PUNISHMENT FOR CRACK UNKNOWNWORD THAT MUCH MORE SEVERE THAN THE PUNISHMENT FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHEN THE REAL DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO IS THE SKIN COLOR OF THE PEOPLE USING THEM . JUDGES THINK THAT'S WRONG . REPUBLICANS THINK THAT'S WRONG . DEMOCRATS THINK THAT'S WRONG , AND YET IT'S BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY REPUBLICAN AND DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTS BECAUSE NO ONE HAS BEEN WILLING TO BRAVE THE POLITICS AND MAKE IT RIGHT . THAT WILL END WHEN I AM PRESIDENT . I THINK IT'S TIME WE ALSO TOOK A HARD LOOK AT THE WISDOM OF UNKNOWNWORD UP SOME UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD DRUG UNKNOWNWORD FOR DECADES . SOMEONE ONCE SAID THAT UNKNOWNWORD MINIMUM SENTENCES FOR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD MAY NOT BE THE BEST WAY TO UNKNOWNWORD JAIL SPACE UNKNOWNWORD HEAL PEOPLE FROM THEIR DISEASE ." THAT SOMEONE WAS GEORGE W . BUSH - SIX YEARS AGO . I DON'T SAY THIS VERY OFTEN , BUT I AGREE WITH THE PRESIDENT . THE DIFFERENCE IS , HE HASN'T DONE ANYTHING ABOUT IT . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , I WILL . WE WILL REVIEW THESE SENTENCES TO SEE WHERE WE CAN BE SMARTER ON CRIME AND REDUCE THE BLIND AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE WILL GIVE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD DRUG UNKNOWNWORD A CHANCE TO SERVE THEIR SENTENCE , WHERE APPROPRIATE , IN THE TYPE OF DRUG UNKNOWNWORD PROGRAMS THAT HAVE PROVEN TO WORK BETTER THAN A PRISON TERM IN CHANGING BAD BEHAVIOR . SO LET'S REFORM THIS SYSTEM . LET'S DO WHAT'S SMART . LET'S DO WHAT'S JUST . NOW , THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT TAKING THESE STEPS WILL RESTORE A MEASURE OF JUSTICE AND EQUALITY TO AMERICA . THEY WILL ALSO RESTORE A SENSE OF CONFIDENCE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE THAT THE SYSTEM DOESN'T JUST WORK - IT WORKS FOR EVERYONE . BUT THERE IS A BROADER POINT I WANT TO MAKE TODAY . IF I HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO LEAD THIS NATION , I WILL ALWAYS BE A PRESIDENT WHO HEARS YOUR VOICE AND UNDERSTANDS YOUR CONCERNS ; A PRESIDENT WHOSE STORY IS LIKE SO MANY OF YOUR OWN - WHOSE LIFE'S WORK HAS BEEN THE UNFINISHED WORK OF OUR LONG MARCH UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE . AND I WILL STAND UP FOR YOU , AND FIGHT FOR YOU , AND WAKE UP EVERY DAY THINKING ABOUT HOW TO MAKE YOUR LIVES BETTER . BUT THE TRUTH IS , ONE MAN CANNOT MAKE A MOVEMENT . NO SINGLE LAW CAN ERASE THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE HEART OF A CHILD WHO UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD ON A TREE ; OR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF A UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD JUSTICE IN THE PURSUIT OF UNKNOWNWORD . NO ONE LEADER , NO MATTER HOW UNKNOWNWORD OR EXPERIENCED , CAN PREVENT TEENAGERS FROM KILLING OTHER TEENAGERS ON THE STREETS OF OUR CITIES ; OR FREE OUR NEIGHBORHOODS FROM THE GRIP OF HOPELESSNESS ; OR MAKE REAL THE PROMISE OF OPPORTUNITY AND EQUALITY FOR EVERY CITIZEN . ONLY A COUNTRY CAN DO THESE THINGS . ONLY THIS COUNTRY CAN DO THESE THINGS . AND THAT IS WHY IF YOU GIVE ME THE CHANCE TO SERVE THIS NATION , THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I WILL DO AS YOUR PRESIDENT IS ASK YOU TO SERVE IT TOO . THE MOST IMPORTANT THING I'LL DO IS CALL ON YOU EVERY DAY TO TAKE A RISK AND DO YOUR PART TO CARRY THIS MOVEMENT FORWARD . AGAINST GREAT ODDS AND UNKNOWNWORD DEEP CYNICISM , I WILL ASK YOU TO BELIEVE AGAIN THAT WE CAN RIGHT THE UNKNOWNWORD WE SEE IN AMERICA . I WOULD NOT HAVE DRIVEN OUT TO CHICAGO AFTER COLLEGE TO ORGANIZE JOBLESS NEIGHBORHOODS IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . I WOULDN'T HAVE ORGANIZED A VOTER UNKNOWNWORD DRIVE , OR BECOME A CIVIL RIGHTS LAWYER , OR A CONSTITUTIONAL LAW PROFESSOR , OR A STATE SENATOR , OR A U.S . SENATOR IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . I WOULD NOT BE STANDING HERE TODAY IF I DIDN'T BELIEVE THIS WAS POSSIBLE . AND I KNOW THAT YOU BELIEVE IT'S POSSIBLE TOO . ONE OF THE MOST INSPIRING THINGS ABOUT THE RESPONSE TO JENA WAS THAT IT DID NOT BEGIN WITH THE ACTIONS OF ANY ONE LEADER . THE CALL WENT OUT TO THOUSANDS ACROSS THE INTERNET AND BLACK RADIO AND ON COLLEGE UNKNOWNWORD LIKE THIS ONE . AND LIKE THE YOUNG AMERICANS OF ANOTHER ERA , YOU LEFT YOUR HOMES , AND GOT ON BUSES , AND TRAVELED SOUTH . IT'S WHAT HAPPENED TWO YEARS EARLIER WHEN STUDENTS HERE AT UNKNOWNWORD AND AMERICANS FROM EVERY WALK OF LIFE TOOK IT UPON THEMSELVES TO TRY AND RESCUE A CITY THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S HOW REAL CHANGE AND TRUE JUSTICE HAVE ALWAYS COME ABOUT . IT TAKES A MOVEMENT TO LIFT A NATION . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO GO INTO OUR CITIES AND SAY THAT IT'S NOT ENOUGH TO JUST FIX OUR CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM ; WHAT WE REALLY NEED IS TO MAKE SURE THAT OUR KIDS DON'T END UP THERE IN THE FIRST PLACE . WE NEED TO SET UP CHILD CARE AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND JOB TRAINING AND DRUG COUNSELING TO GIVE OUR CHILDREN A PLACE TO TURN TO . AND WE NEED PARENTS TO START ACTING LIKE PARENTS AND SPEND MORE TIME WITH THEIR CHILDREN AND READ TO THEM ONCE IN AWHILE . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO FINISH WHAT BEGAN IN TOPEKA , KANSAS AND LITTLE ROCK , ARKANSAS . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT OF AMERICANS FROM EVERY CITY AND TOWN , OF EVERY RACE AND BACKGROUND TO STAND UP AND SAY THAT NO MATTER WHAT YOU LOOK LIKE OR WHERE YOU COME FROM , EVERY CHILD IN AMERICA SHOULD HAVE THE OPPORTUNITY TO RECEIVE THE BEST EDUCATION THIS COUNTRY HAS TO OFFER . EVERY CHILD . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO DEMAND THAT WE REBUILD OUR CRUMBLING SCHOOLS ; THAT WE INVEST IN EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION ; THAT WE RECRUIT AN ARMY OF NEW TEACHERS , AND PAY THEM BETTER , AND SUPPORT THEM MORE . IT WILL TAKE A MOVEMENT TO ENSURE THAT EVERY YOUNG PERSON GETS THE CHANCE THAT UNKNOWNWORD GAVE ALL OF YOU ; TO SAY THAT AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 21ST CENTURY , A COLLEGE EDUCATION IS NO LONGER A UNKNOWNWORD FOR THOSE WHO CAN AFFORD IT ; IT IS THE BIRTHRIGHT OF EVERY AMERICAN . SO WHEN YOU GO BACK TO YOUR CLASSROOMS AND YOUR UNKNOWNWORD ROOMS AND YOU BEGIN ANOTHER YEAR AT UNKNOWNWORD UNIVERSITY , I ASK YOU TO REMEMBER HOW FAR WE'VE COME , BUT I URGE YOU TO THINK HARD ABOUT WHERE WE NEED TO GO . I URGE YOU TO THINK ABOUT THE RISKS YOU WILL TAKE AND THE ROLE YOU WILL PLAY IN BUILDING THE MOVEMENT THAT WILL GET US THERE . AND I ASK YOU REMEMBER THE STORY OF UNKNOWNWORD AND JOSHUA . MOST OF YOU KNOW THAT UNKNOWNWORD WAS CALLED BY GOD TO LEAD HIS PEOPLE TO THE PROMISED LAND . AND IN THE FACE OF A UNKNOWNWORD AND HIS UNKNOWNWORD , ACROSS AN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND ALONG THE WALLS OF AN ANGRY UNKNOWNWORD , HE SUCCEEDED IN LEADING HIS PEOPLE OUT OF UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD . HE LED THEM THROUGH GREAT DANGERS , AND THEY GOT FAR ENOUGH SO THAT UNKNOWNWORD COULD POINT THE WAY UNKNOWNWORD FREEDOM ON THE FAR BANKS OF THE RIVER UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET , IT WAS NOT IN UNKNOWNWORD PLAN TO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD CROSS THE RIVER . INSTEAD HE WOULD CALL ON JOSHUA TO FINISH THE WORK THAT UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN . HE WOULD ASK JOSHUA TO TAKE HIS PEOPLE THAT FINAL DISTANCE . EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM STANDS ON THE SHOULDERS OF MANY UNKNOWNWORD . THEY ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD MEN AND WOMEN WHO MARCHED AND FOUGHT AND BLED FOR THE RIGHTS AND FREEDOMS WE ENJOY TODAY . THEY HAVE TAKEN US MANY MILES OVER AN IMPOSSIBLE JOURNEY . BUT YOU ARE MEMBERS OF THE JOSHUA GENERATION . AND IT IS NOW UP TO YOU TO FINISH THE WORK THAT THEY BEGAN . IT IS UP TO YOU TO CROSS THE RIVER . WHEN JOSHUA DISCOVERED THE CHALLENGE HE FACED , HE HAD HIS DOUBTS AND HIS WORRIES . BUT THE UNKNOWNWORD TOLD JOSHUA NOT TO FEAR . HE SAID , UNKNOWNWORD STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE , FOR I AM WITH YOU WHEREVER YOU GO ." THOSE ARE THE WORDS I WILL LEAVE YOU WITH TODAY . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF INJUSTICE . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE IN THE FACE OF JOBLESSNESS AND UNKNOWNWORD AND HOPELESSNESS . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE , IN THE FACE OF OUR DOUBTS AND FEARS , IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD , IN THE FACE OF CYNICISM , IN THE FACE OF A MIGHTY RIVER . BE STRONG AND HAVE COURAGE AND LET US CROSS OVER TO THAT PROMISED LAND TOGETHER . CONGRATULATIONS ON ANOTHER YEAR , AND THANK YOU SO MUCH .
BLUE	YESTERDAY I SPOKE ABOUT THE FUTURE OF THE AMERICAN ECONOMY AT THE UNKNOWNWORD . AND IN MANY WAYS , UNKNOWNWORD IS A SYMBOL OF THE NEW ECONOMY THAT'S TAKING HOLD - THE WEALTH CREATED ; THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THE TECHNOLOGY THAT'S HELPING TO DRIVE GROWTH , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT NOW SPANS THE GLOBE . IT'S NO SECRET THAT A FUNDAMENTAL UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMY IS TAKING PLACE . IN BOOKS AND ON BALANCE SHEETS , AT POLICY INSTITUTES AND AROUND KITCHEN TABLES , PEOPLE ARE TRYING TO MAKE SENSE OF WHERE THE UNKNOWNWORD AND STRONG CURRENTS OF GLOBALIZATION ARE TAKING US . WHAT WE DO KNOW IS THAT AMERICANS ARE LIVING AND WORKING IN A UNKNOWNWORD CHANGING ECONOMIC REALITY . THIS ISN'T THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS HAPPENED . TIME AND AGAIN , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS UNKNOWNWORD UPHEAVAL - FROM SLAVE TO FREE ; FROM AGRICULTURE TO INDUSTRY ; FROM PEACE TO UNKNOWNWORD , AND FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO PEACE . AND TIME AND AGAIN , THE AMERICAN ECONOMY HAS UNKNOWNWORD STRONGER . THE ONE UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN THE ADVANCEMENT OF INDIVIDUAL OPPORTUNITY . THERE ARE FEW PRINCIPLES MORE BASIC TO OUR COUNTRY , AND THERE IS NONE MORE BASIC TO OUR ECONOMY . WE BELIEVE THAT THERE IS A PLACE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY FOR EVERY AMERICAN'S DREAM . AND WE KNOW THAT WHEN WE EXTEND THAT DREAM OF OPPORTUNITY TO MORE AMERICANS , ALL OF US GAIN . AMERICANS ALSO KNOW THAT OPPORTUNITY DOESN'T COME EASY . YOU HAVE TO WORK FOR IT . HERE I THINK OF MY FATHER-IN-LAW , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . HE RAISED HIS TWO CHILDREN WITH HIS WIFE UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD CHICAGO . THEY FACED WHAT OTHER AFRICAN-AMERICAN FAMILIES FACED AT THE TIME - BOTH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT LIMITED THEIR EFFORT TO GET AHEAD . AND THEY FACED AN ADDITIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AT AGE 30 , UNKNOWNWORD WAS DIAGNOSED WITH MULTIPLE SCLEROSIS . AND YET , EVERY DAY OF HIS LIFE , EVEN WHEN HE HAD TO LEAVE AN HOUR EARLIER IN THE MORNING AND RELY ON A WALKER TO GET HIM THERE , HE WENT TO WORK AT THE LOCAL WATER UNKNOWNWORD PLANT WHILE UNKNOWNWORD STAYED HOME WITH THE CHILDREN . AND ON THAT SINGLE SALARY , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PROVIDED FOR HIS FAMILY , SENDING MY WIFE MICHELLE AND HER BROTHER UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS IS AN AMERICAN STORY THAT PLAYS OUT IN MILLIONS OF FAMILIES EACH AND EVERY DAY . IT IS A STORY THAT IS SHARED BY THE CAREGIVER WHO IS UP BEFORE DAWN AND THE TEACHER WHO NEVER UNKNOWNWORD THE BELL ; BY THE UNKNOWNWORD WHO WORKS LATE AND THE UNKNOWNWORD ON THE NIGHT SHIFT . IT IS THE STORY OF A SOCIETY THAT VALUES WORK , AND OF PEOPLE WHO WORK TO CREATE A BETTER FUTURE FOR THEIR FAMILIES . THIS STORY COULD NOT EXIST WITHOUT A BASIC SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS COUNTRY . THAT UNKNOWNWORD SAYS THAT IF YOU WORK HARD , YOUR WORK WILL BE REWARDED . THAT EVERYBODY HAS AN OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE A DECENT LIVING , TO RAISE A FAMILY , TO GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE BEST CHANCE AT SUCCESS , AND TO LOOK FORWARD TO A SECURE RETIREMENT . THAT PEOPLE LIKE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD CAN GIVE THEIR CHILDREN THE CHANCE TO DREAM BIGGER , AND TO REACH NEW UNKNOWNWORD . THAT SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD IS STARTING TO UNKNOWNWORD . IN OUR NEW ECONOMY , THERE IS NO SHORTAGE OF NEW WEALTH . BUT WAGES ARE NOT KEEPING PACE . WORKERS ARE MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO JOB LOSS AND MORE WORRIED ABOUT RETIREMENT . THOSE AMERICANS FORTUNATE ENOUGH TO HAVE HEALTH CARE ARE PAYING MORE FOR IT - HEALTH CARE PREMIUMS HAVE RISEN NEARLY 90 % IN THE LAST SIX YEARS . AMERICANS ARE FACING DEEPER PERSONAL DEBT . FROM FILLING UP THE GAS TANK TO PAYING FOR A COLLEGE EDUCATION , EVERYTHING SEEMS TO COST MORE . THIS IS NOT JUST HAPPENING BY CHANCE . IT'S NOT SOMETHING WE CAN JUST UNKNOWNWORD UP TO TEMPORARY UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S HAPPENING IN PART BECAUSE OF THE CHOICES WE'RE MAKING , AND THE WAY THAT WE'RE MAKING THOSE CHOICES . IT'S HAPPENING BECAUSE WE'VE GONE TOO FAR FROM BEING A COUNTRY WHERE WE'RE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER , TO A COUNTRY WHERE EVERYONE'S ON THEIR OWN . TODAY , I'M GOING TO FOCUS ON ONE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR ECONOMIC POLICY WHERE WE NEED TO MAKE DIFFERENT CHOICES . BECAUSE NOWHERE IS THIS SHIFT IN OUR PRIORITIES MORE EVIDENT THAN IN OUR TAX POLICIES . INSTEAD OF WORKING TO FIND WAYS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE BURDEN ON THE MIDDLE CLASS , WE'VE DEVELOPED UNKNOWNWORD WAYS TO REMOVE THE BURDEN FROM THE WELL-OFF . INSTEAD OF HAVING ALL OF US PAY OUR FAIR SHARE , WE'VE GOT OVER UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION WORTH OF UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CORPORATE TAX CODE . THIS ISN'T THE INVISIBLE HAND OF THE MARKET AT WORK . IT'S THE SUCCESSFUL WORK OF SPECIAL INTERESTS . FOR DECADES , WE'VE SEEN A SUCCESSFUL STRATEGY TO RIDE UNKNOWNWORD SENTIMENT IN THIS COUNTRY TOWARD TAX CUTS THAT FAVOR WEALTH , NOT WORK . AND FOR DECADES , WE'VE SEEN THE GAPS IN WEALTH IN THIS COUNTRY GROW WIDER , WHILE THE COSTS TO WORKING PEOPLE ARE GREATER . WE'VE GOT A SHIFT IN OUR TAX VALUES THAT UNKNOWNWORD BENEFITS THE WEALTHIEST AMERICANS ; CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD THAT SERVE NO NATIONAL PURPOSE ; TAX BREAKS THAT ALLOW COMPANIES TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PROFITS OVERSEAS ; A GOVERNMENT THAT'S UNKNOWNWORD WHEN DEALING WITH UNKNOWNWORD TAX HAVEN COUNTRIES ; AN UNKNOWNWORD TAX CODE THAT'S TOO COMPLICATED FOR ORDINARY FOLKS TO UNDERSTAND , BUT JUST COMPLICATED ENOUGH TO WORK FOR SOMEONE WHO KNOWS HOW TO WORK THE SYSTEM . WHEN BIG BUSINESS DOESN'T LIKE SOMETHING IN THE TAX CODE , THEY CAN HIRE A UNKNOWNWORD TO GET IT CHANGED , BUT MOST WORKING PEOPLE CAN'T AFFORD A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . INSTEAD OF UNKNOWNWORD THAT CORE AMERICAN VALUE - OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL - WE'VE HAD A SYSTEM IN WASHINGTON WHERE OUR LAWS AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OUT OPPORTUNITIES FOR THE FEW . THE NUMBERS DON'T LIE . AT A TIME WHEN INCOME INEQUALITY IS GROWING UNKNOWNWORD , THE BUSH TAX CUTS GAVE THE WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS A TAX CUT THAT WAS TWICE AS LARGE AS THE MIDDLE CLASS . AT A TIME WHEN AMERICANS ARE WORKING HARDER THAN EVER , WE ARE TAXING INCOME FROM WORK AT NEARLY TWICE THE LEVEL THAT WE'RE TAXING GAINS FOR INVESTORS . TALK ABOUT THIS IN UNKNOWNWORD COMPANY , AND SOONER OR LATER YOU'LL GET UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD CLASS WARFARE . AS IF IT'S UNKNOWNWORD TO POINT OUT THAT SOME CEOS MAKE MORE IN TEN MINUTES THAN A WORKER MAKES IN TEN MONTHS . OR , AS MY FRIEND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PUT IT TO ME - "IF THERE'S CLASS WARFARE GOING ON IN AMERICA , THEN MY CLASS IS WINNING ." WHAT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD KNOWS IS WHAT ALL AMERICANS HAVE TO REMEMBER - TO GET THROUGH THESE UNCERTAIN TIMES , WE HAVE TO RECOGNIZE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN ONE UNKNOWNWORD SUCCESS . WHEN FOLKS ARE HURTING OUT THERE ON MAIN STREET , THAT'S NOT GOOD FOR WALL STREET . WHEN THE CHANGES IN OUR ECONOMY ARE LEAVING TOO MANY PEOPLE BEHIND , THE COMPETITIVENESS OF OUR COUNTRY RISKS FALLING BEHIND . WHEN THAT DREAM OF OPPORTUNITY IS DENIED TO TOO MANY AMERICANS , THEN ULTIMATELY THAT PAIN HAS A WAY OF UNKNOWNWORD UP . WE WELCOME SUCCESS STORIES HERE IN AMERICA . WE ADMIRE THOSE WHO HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE TOP OF THE LADDER . WE JUST NEED TO BE SURE THAT THE LADDER DOESN'T GET TAKEN AWAY FROM THE REST OF US . WE WANT A SYSTEM BASED ON FAIRNESS - NOT SPECIAL FAVORS . TO UNKNOWNWORD A COURSE THROUGH THE CHANGE THAT'S TAKING HOLD , WE HAVE TO HOLD UNKNOWNWORD TO THAT CORE PRINCIPLE : THAT OUR ECONOMY MUST ADVANCE OPPORTUNITY FOR ALL AMERICANS . MY OWN EXPERIENCE OVER TWO DECADES TELLS ME THAT WHEN YOU GIVE PEOPLE A CHANCE AT THAT OPPORTUNITY , THEY WILL TAKE IT . THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AS A COMMUNITY ORGANIZER ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF CHICAGO , WHERE WE SET UP JOB TRAINING PROGRAMS AND AFTER SCHOOL PROGRAMS AND COUNSELING PROGRAMS TO BRING HOPE TO PLACES THAT HAD BEEN HURT BY CHANGE . THAT'S WHAT I FOUND AS A STATE SENATOR IN ILLINOIS WHEN WE CREATED THE STATE EARNED INCOME TAX CREDIT SO WE COULD PUT $100 MILLION OF TAX CUTS INTO THE POCKETS OF WORKING FAMILIES . THAT'S WHAT I'VE BEEN FOCUSED ON AS A UNITED STATES SENATOR , AS I'VE WORKED TO EXPAND THE CHILD TAX CREDIT TO INCLUDE CHILDREN IN MINIMUM WAGE FAMILIES , AND TO CLOSE UNKNOWNWORD THAT SHIFT THE TAX BURDEN ON TO WORKING PEOPLE . AND THAT'S WHAT I'LL DO AS PRESIDENT . BECAUSE WHEN IT COMES TO OUR ECONOMY , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE ARE NOT THE PROBLEM - THEY ARE THE ANSWER . I'LL RESTORE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE TAX CODE , AND FAIRNESS FOR THE AMERICAN MIDDLE CLASS . IT'S TIME TO STAND UP TO SPECIAL INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . I'LL END THE UNKNOWNWORD TREATMENT THAT'S BUILT INTO OUR TAX CODE BY ELIMINATING CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD AND TAX BREAKS . WE SHOULDN'T BE UNKNOWNWORD OUR TAX CODE TO BENEFIT A FEW POWERFUL INTERESTS - WE SHOULD BE INSISTING THAT EVERYONE PAYS THEIR FAIR SHARE , AND WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , THEY WILL . AND IT'S TIME TO SHED SOME UNKNOWNWORD NOT ONLY ON COMPANIES THAT ABUSE THE TAX CODE , BUT ALSO ON THE SECRETIVE UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEM . WE'LL CREATE A LIST OF COUNTRIES WHERE TAX UNKNOWNWORD HIDE THEIR INCOME AND COST AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD BILLIONS OF DOLLARS EVERY YEAR . WE'LL LEAD THE INTERNATIONAL COMMUNITY TO NEW STANDARDS OF INFORMATION SHARING . AND WE'LL PENALIZE COMPANIES AND INDIVIDUALS WHO USE THOSE UNKNOWNWORD AND ILLEGALLY UNKNOWNWORD THEIR TAX OBLIGATIONS . IF WE'RE GOING TO KEEP THAT SOCIAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR A NEW CENTURY , WE NEED A TAX CODE THAT'S FAIR - A TAX CODE THAT REWARDS WORK AND ADVANCES OPPORTUNITY . EVERY AMERICAN WHO IS READY TO WORK FOR THEIR AMERICAN DREAM SHOULD BE ABLE TO TRUST THAT THEY HAVE A GOVERNMENT THAT WORKS FOR THEM . I'LL KEEP THAT TRUST BY CUTTING TAXES FOR WORKING PEOPLE , HOMEOWNERS , AND SENIORS , AND BY UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD FOR MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS . FIRST , I'LL GIVE A TAX CUT TO WORKING PEOPLE . THE AMERICAN PEOPLE WORK LONGER AND HARDER THAN THE PEOPLE OF ANY OTHER WEALTHY NATION IN THE WORLD . BUT THEIR HOURS ARE GETTING LONGER AND THEIR WAGES AREN'T GETTING ANY HIGHER . THEIR COSTS ARE GOING UP , BUT THEIR ECONOMIC SECURITY IS GOING DOWN . WHEN A SINGLE MOM GETS HER PAYCHECK , THAT CHECK GETS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN SHE GOES TO BUY UNKNOWNWORD , THAT PURCHASE GETS UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN SHE REACHES HER RETIREMENT , HER SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFIT GETS UNKNOWNWORD . MEANWHILE , HER UNKNOWNWORD INVESTMENTS GET UNKNOWNWORD AT A LOWER RATE , AND THE CORPORATION SHE WORKS FOR HAS ALL KINDS OF UNKNOWNWORD BUILT INTO THE TAX CODE BECAUSE THEY'VE GOT LOBBYISTS IN WASHINGTON UNKNOWNWORD UP FOR THEIR INTERESTS . IT'S TIME FOR THAT TO CHANGE . IT'S TIME FOR AMERICANS TO HAVE A PRESIDENT IN THE OVAL OFFICE WHO MAKES DECISIONS BASED ON THEIR INTEREST , NOT THE SPECIAL INTERESTS . LET'S NOT FORGET THAT EVEN IN THIS ERA OF ECONOMIC CHANGE , OUR WEALTH AS A NATION REMAINS FOUNDED ON WORK . I'D REWARD WORK BY PROVIDING AN INCOME TAX CUT OF UP TO $500 PER PERSON - OR $1,000 FOR EACH WORKING FAMILY - TO OFFSET THE PAYROLL TAX THAT THEY'RE ALREADY PAYING . AT A TIME WHEN CONFIDENCE IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS UNKNOWNWORD , THIS WILL GIVE MIDDLE CLASS AMERICANS A BREAK , AND HELP THEM DEAL WITH THE RISING COSTS OF ENERGY , EDUCATION , AND SAVING FOR RETIREMENT . UNDER MY PLAN , UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS - AND THEIR FAMILIES - WILL GET A TAX CUT . AND BECAUSE THIS CREDIT WOULD BE GREATER THAN THEIR INCOME TAX BILL , MY PROPOSAL WOULD ELIMINATE ALL INCOME TAXES FOR 10 MILLION WORKING AMERICANS . IN SO MANY WORKING FAMILIES , TWO PARENTS ARE WORKING FULL TIME , TRYING TO BRING UP THEIR CHILDREN , AND TRYING TO KEEP UP WITH SO MANY COSTS THAT KEEP GROWING WHILE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD DON'T . THIS TAX CREDIT WILL STRENGTHEN WORKING FAMILIES BY INCREASING THE MONEY IN THEIR POCKETS , AND REDUCING THE WORRY THAT UNKNOWNWORD OVER SO MANY AMERICANS . AND THIS TAX CREDIT WILL BE A PARTICULAR BOOST TO SINGLE WORKING MOMS , WHO PUT IN THE HOURS TO PROVIDE THE BEST OPPORTUNITIES POSSIBLE FOR THEIR KIDS , BUT STRUGGLE TO UNKNOWNWORD A PAYCHECK THAT CAN'T COVER THEIR GROWING NEEDS . THE SECOND THING I'LL DO TO EASE THE BURDEN ON THE MIDDLE CLASS IS PROVIDE A UNIVERSAL HOMEOWNERS ' TAX CREDIT . IF WORK IS HOW MOST AMERICANS SEEK THEIR DREAM , A HOME IS HOW MANY FAMILIES REALIZE IT . A HOME IS A SOURCE OF STABILITY , A BUILDING BLOCK FOR COMMUNITIES , AND THE MOST VALUABLE THING THAT MOST MIDDLE CLASS FOLKS WILL OWN . BUT - AS HAS BEEN MADE UNKNOWNWORD CLEAR THROUGH THE SUB-PRIME CRISIS - THAT SOURCE OF STABILITY CAN QUICKLY BECOME THE SOURCE OF ECONOMIC INSECURITY . TOO MANY AMERICANS ARE STRUGGLING UNDER THE WEIGHT OF THEIR MORTGAGES . HOMEOWNERS NEED A BREAK . TODAY , WE HAVE A MORTGAGE INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD , BUT IT ONLY GOES TO PEOPLE WHO UNKNOWNWORD ON THEIR TAXES . LIKE SO MUCH IN OUR TAX CODE , THIS UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD TOWARD THE WELL-OFF . ONLY A THIRD OF HOMEOWNERS TAKE ADVANTAGE OF THIS CREDIT . I'LL CREATE A MORTGAGE INTEREST CREDIT SO THAT BOTH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD GET A BREAK . THIS WILL IMMEDIATELY BENEFIT 10 MILLION HOMEOWNERS IN AMERICA . THE VAST MAJORITY OF THESE ARE FOLKS WHO MAKE UNDER $50,000 PER YEAR , WHO WILL GET A BREAK OF 10 PERCENT OF THEIR MORTGAGE INTEREST RATE . FOR MOST MIDDLE CLASS FAMILIES , THIS WILL ADD UP TO ABOUT $500 EACH YEAR . THIS CREDIT WILL ALSO EXTEND A HAND TO MANY OF THE MILLIONS OF AMERICANS WHO ARE STUCK IN THE SUBPRIME CRISIS BY GIVING THEM SOME BREATHING ROOM TO REFINANCE OR SELL THEIR HOMES . THE THIRD THING I'LL DO IS PROVIDE A UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUT FOR AMERICA'S SENIORS . SINCE THE NEW DEAL , WE'VE HAD A BASIC UNDERSTANDING IN AMERICA . IF YOU WORK HARD AND PAY INTO THE SYSTEM , YOU'VE EARNED THE RIGHT TO A SECURE RETIREMENT . BUT EVEN THOUGH THEY'VE HELD UP THEIR END OF THE BARGAIN , MANY SENIORS ARE STRUGGLING TO KEEP PACE WITH COSTS . AND AS SO MANY AMERICANS KNOW , THEIR WORRY BECOMES AN ENTIRE FAMILY'S WORRY . THIS UNKNOWNWORD HAS BEEN GREATER SINCE UNKNOWNWORD , WHEN TAXES ON SOCIAL SECURITY BENEFITS WERE RAISED . MILLIONS OF SENIORS SAW THEIR NET BENEFITS GO DOWN . THEY ALSO HAD TO TAKE ON THE ADDED UNKNOWNWORD - AND SOMETIMES COST - OF UNKNOWNWORD A COMPLICATED TAX RETURN . IT'S TIME TO GIVE AMERICA'S SENIORS A BREAK . SO I'LL GIVE RETIRED FOLKS THE SAME KIND OF RELIEF I'LL OFFER TO WORKING PEOPLE . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL WORK TO SEE THAT NO RETIREE MAKING LESS THAN $50,000 EACH YEAR HAS TO PAY INCOME TAX . THIS WILL ELIMINATE INCOME TAXES FOR ABOUT 7 MILLION AMERICANS , AT A SAVINGS RATE OF ROUGHLY UNKNOWNWORD EACH YEAR . AND 22 MILLION SENIORS WON'T EVEN HAVE TO FILE A RETURN AND HIRE AN EXPENSIVE TAX UNKNOWNWORD . THE FINAL PART OF MY PLAN WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD THE PROCESS OF UNKNOWNWORD A TAX RETURN FOR ALL AMERICANS . THE TAX CODE HAS BECOME FAR TOO COMPLEX . UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ARE BUILT INTO THE SYSTEM , BUT ORDINARY PEOPLE DON'T HAVE THE TIME TO FIGURE THEM OUT WITHOUT GOING TO AN EXPERT UNKNOWNWORD - YET ANOTHER COST AT TAX TIME . IN 2004 , THE UNKNOWNWORD ESTIMATED THAT IT TOOK UNKNOWNWORD HOURS FOR AN INDIVIDUAL TO COMPLETE HER TAX UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TO THE UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL TAXPAYER ADVOCATE , "THE MOST SERIOUS PROBLEM FACING TAXPAYERS TODAY IS THE COMPLEXITY OF THE INTERNAL REVENUE CODE ." THIS PAST YEAR , USA TODAY HAD FIVE DIFFERENT PROFESSIONALS ADD UP THE TAX BILL FOR ONE WORKING FAMILY - AND THEY ALL GOT DIFFERENT ANSWERS . IT'S TIME TO CUT THROUGH THE COMPLEXITY . WHEN I'M PRESIDENT , WE'LL PUT IN PLACE A SYSTEM WHERE 40 MILLION AMERICANS WITH A JOB AND A BANK ACCOUNT WHO TAKE THE STANDARD UNKNOWNWORD CAN DO THEIR TAXES IN LESS THAN FIVE MINUTES . THE GOVERNMENT ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD WAGE AND BANK ACCOUNT INFORMATION , SO THERE'S NO REASON THE UNKNOWNWORD CAN'T SEND AMERICANS UNKNOWNWORD TAX UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD . THIS UNKNOWNWORD NO MORE WORRY . NO MORE UNKNOWNWORD TIME . NO MORE EXTRA EXPENSES FOR A TAX UNKNOWNWORD . MAKING THIS CHANGE WOULD SAVE AMERICANS MORE THAN $2 BILLION IN TAX UNKNOWNWORD FEES , MORE THAN 200 MILLION HOURS OF WORK , AND AN UNKNOWNWORD AMOUNT OF UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . ALL OF THESE PROPOSALS ARE ABOUT MAKING AMERICA'S TAX CODE SIMPLER , AND MAKING IT WORK BETTER FOR WORKING AMERICANS . AS WE SIMPLIFY THE TAX CODE SO THAT IT WORKS FOR THE MIDDLE CLASS , WE'LL HAVE TO ADDRESS UNKNOWNWORD COSTS . AMERICANS ARE TIRED OF AN ATTITUDE TOWARD TAXING AND SPENDING IN WASHINGTON THAT IS LEAVING A LEGACY OF DEBT TO OUR CHILDREN AND GRANDCHILDREN . TO ENSURE THAT WE ARE FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE , WE'LL GAIN REVENUE BY SHUTTING DOWN CORPORATE UNKNOWNWORD AND TAX UNKNOWNWORD . WE'LL ALSO TURN THE PAGE ON AN APPROACH THAT GIVES UNKNOWNWORD TAX CUTS TO THE WEALTHIEST 1 PERCENT OF AMERICANS EVEN THOUGH THEY DON'T NEED THEM AND DIDN'T ASK FOR THEM . WE'VE LOST THE BALANCE BETWEEN WORK AND WEALTH . I WILL CLOSE THE UNKNOWNWORD INTEREST UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE TOP DIVIDENDS AND CAPITAL GAINS RATE TO SOMETHING CLOSER TO - BUT NO GREATER THAN - THE RATES RONALD REAGAN SET IN 1986 . AS WE MAKE THESE CHANGES , WE'LL BE SURE TO ENCOURAGE GROWTH AND INNOVATION . SO WE'LL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD COMPANIES AND SMALL BUSINESSES FROM CAPITAL GAINS TO GIVE THEM AN ADDED BOOST . BECAUSE WHEN MORE AMERICANS TAP THAT WELL OF OPPORTUNITY , ALL OF US ARE BETTER OFF . YOU KNOW , THE TRUTH IS , MOST AMERICANS AREN'T ASKING FOR A LOT . THEY DON'T NEED OVERSEAS TAX UNKNOWNWORD OR A LONG LIST OF UNKNOWNWORD . THEY JUST WANT A FAIR SHAKE . AND THEY COULD STAND A BREAK . BECAUSE MOST AMERICANS HAVE SIMPLE DREAMS . A JOB . A PLACE TO RAISE THEIR FAMILY . A SECURE RETIREMENT . A CHANCE TO CREATE OPPORTUNITIES FOR THEIR KIDS THAT MIGHT EXTEND A LITTLE FURTHER THAN THEIR OWN . AFTER ALL , THE WEALTH OF OUR NATION IS ROOTED IN THE WORK OF OUR PEOPLE . IN HIS FIRST STATE OF THE UNION MESSAGE TO CONGRESS , ABRAHAM UNKNOWNWORD LAID OUT A CORE PRINCIPLE : UNKNOWNWORD IS ONLY THE FRUIT OF LABOR , AND COULD NEVER HAVE EXISTED IF LABOR HAD NOT FIRST EXISTED . LABOR IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF CAPITAL , AND DESERVES MUCH THE HIGHER CONSIDERATION ." IT'S A SIMPLE PROPOSITION . THAT THE WEALTH WE EARN COMES FROM THE WORK THAT WE DO . IT'S A PROPOSITION THAT IS LIVED , DAY IN AND DAY OUT , IN THE HOMES OF MILLIONS OF WORKING AMERICANS . THE STEADY PURSUIT OF SIMPLE DREAMS . THE AMERICAN ECONOMY IS THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL OF THOSE DREAMS . NOW - AT A TIME OF RISING COSTS AND RISING UNCERTAINTY - IT'S TIME FOR UNKNOWNWORD FROM WASHINGTON THAT PUT A LITTLE WIND AT THE BACKS OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . NOW IS THE TIME FOR US TO COME TOGETHER AS A NATION BEHIND A NEW UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE 21ST CENTURY - ONE THAT GIVES THE AMERICAN PEOPLE A LIFT , SO THEY CAN LIFT UP THIS COUNTRY UNKNOWNWORD .
BLUE	UNKNOWNWORD YEARS AGO THIS WEEK , GOVERNOR FRANKLIN UNKNOWNWORD ROOSEVELT TOOK HIS CAMPAIGN FOR THE PRESIDENCY TO THE COMMONWEALTH CLUB IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT WAS A TIME WHEN FAITH IN THE AMERICAN ECONOMY WAS UNKNOWNWORD - A TIME WHEN TOO MANY OF OUR LEADERS UNKNOWNWORD TO THE CONVENTIONAL THINKING THAT SAID ALL WE COULD DO IS SIT IDLY BY AND WISH THAT OUR PROBLEMS WOULD GO AWAY ON THEIR OWN . BUT FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT CHALLENGED THAT CYNICISM . UNKNOWNWORD A CRISIS OF CONFIDENCE ROOSEVELT CALLED FOR A UNKNOWNWORD OF VALUES ." HE MADE CLEAR THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , OUR RIGHT TO LIVE MUST ALSO INCLUDE THE RIGHT TO LIVE UNKNOWNWORD ; THAT GOVERNMENT MUST FAVOR NO SMALL GROUP AT THE EXPENSE OF ALL ITS CITIZENS ; AND THAT IN ORDER FOR US TO PROSPER AS ONE NATION , UNKNOWNWORD RESPONSIBLE HEADS OF FINANCE AND INDUSTRY , INSTEAD OF ACTING EACH FOR HIMSELF , MUST WORK TOGETHER TO ACHIEVE THE COMMON END ." THIS VISION OF AMERICA WOULD REQUIRE CHANGE THAT WENT BEYOND REPLACING A FAILED PRESIDENT . IT WOULD REQUIRE A UNKNOWNWORD TRUST IN THE MARKET AND A UNKNOWNWORD SPIRIT OF OBLIGATION AND COOPERATION BETWEEN BUSINESS AND WORKERS ; BETWEEN A PEOPLE AND THEIR GOVERNMENT . AS FDR PUT IT , UNKNOWNWORD IN AMERICA , FAITH IN OUR TRADITION OF PERSONAL RESPONSIBILITY , FAITH IN OUR INSTITUTIONS , AND FAITH IN OURSELVES DEMANDS THAT WE ALL RECOGNIZE THE NEW TERMS OF THE OLD SOCIAL CONTRACT ." UNKNOWNWORD YEARS LATER , THIS FAITH IS CALLING US TO ACT ONCE MORE . WE CERTAINLY DO NOT FACE A TEST OF THE MAGNITUDE THAT UNKNOWNWORD GENERATION DID . BUT WE ARE TESTED STILL . WE MEET AT A TIME WHEN MUCH OF WALL STREET IS HOLDING ITS COLLECTIVE UNKNOWNWORD . HERE AT THE UNKNOWNWORD AND ALL ACROSS AMERICA , THE TICKERS ARE BEING WATCHED WITH UNKNOWNWORD ANXIETY AND UNKNOWNWORD UNCERTAINTY . THERE IS MUCH UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT UNKNOWNWORD MEETING OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , AND WITH EACH NEW DAY , THERE IS HOPE THAT THE HEADLINES WILL BRING BETTER NEWS THAN THE LAST . IT IS A HOPE SHARED BY MILLIONS OF AMERICANS , MEN AND WOMEN , WHO HAVE EXPERIENCED THIS KIND OF ANXIETY AND UNCERTAINTY LONG BEFORE IT ARRIVED ON WALL STREET . THEY ARE THE FAMILIES I MEET EVERY DAY WHO ARE WORKING LONGER HOURS FOR A PAYCHECK THAT ISN'T GETTING ANY BIGGER AND CAN'T SEEM TO COVER THE RISING COST OF HEALTH CARE AND TUITION AND TAXES . THEY ARE THE MAYTAG WORKERS I'VE MET IN GALESBURG , ILLINOIS AND NEWTON , IOWA - WORKERS WHO BELIEVED THEY WOULD RETIRE AND NEVER HAVE TO WORK AGAIN ; WORKERS WHO NOW COMPETE WITH THEIR TEENAGERS FOR MINIMUM WAGE JOBS AT WAL-MART BECAUSE THEIR FACTORY MOVED OVERSEAS . THESE AMERICANS AND MANY OTHERS WERE ALREADY STRUGGLING BEFORE THE PROBLEMS ON WALL STREET AROSE . NOW THEY ARE LOOKING AT THEIR HOMES AND WONDERING IF THEIR GREATEST SOURCE OF WEALTH WILL STILL HAVE THE SAME VALUE IN ANOTHER YEAR , OR EVEN ANOTHER MONTH . AND WE'RE ALL WONDERING WHETHER THIS WILL UNKNOWNWORD OVER TO THE WIDER ECONOMY . SO WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED RIGHT NOW TO RESTORE CONFIDENCE IN OUR MARKETS . WE KNOW THERE IS A NEED TO RENEW PUBLIC TRUST IN OUR MARKETS . BUT I ALSO THINK THAT THIS IS ANOTHER MOMENT THAT REQUIRES , IN UNKNOWNWORD WORDS , A UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR VALUES AS A NATION . I BELIEVE THAT AMERICA'S FREE MARKET HAS BEEN THE ENGINE OF AMERICA'S GREAT PROGRESS . IT'S CREATED A PROSPERITY THAT IS THE ENVY OF THE WORLD . IT'S LED TO A STANDARD OF LIVING UNMATCHED IN HISTORY . AND IT HAS PROVIDED GREAT REWARDS TO THE INNOVATORS AND UNKNOWNWORD WHO HAVE MADE AMERICA A BEACON FOR SCIENCE , AND TECHNOLOGY , AND UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , OUR GRAND UNKNOWNWORD HAS ONLY WORKED BECAUSE WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD INVISIBLE HAND WITH A HIGHER PRINCIPLE . IT'S THE IDEA THAT WE ARE ALL IN THIS TOGETHER . FROM CEOS TO SHAREHOLDERS , FROM UNKNOWNWORD TO FACTORY WORKERS , WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN EACH OTHER'S SUCCESS BECAUSE THE MORE AMERICANS PROSPER , THE MORE AMERICA UNKNOWNWORD . THAT'S WHY WE'VE HAD UNKNOWNWORD OF INDUSTRY WHO'VE MADE IT THEIR MISSION TO PAY WELL ENOUGH THAT THEIR EMPLOYEES COULD AFFORD THE PRODUCTS THEY MADE . THAT'S WHY EMPLOYEES AT COMPANIES LIKE UNKNOWNWORD DON'T MIND THE VAST SUCCESS OF THEIR CEOS - BECAUSE THEY SHARE IN THAT SUCCESS JUST THE SAME . AND THAT'S WHY OUR ECONOMY HASN'T JUST BEEN THE WORLD'S GREATEST WEALTH CREATOR - IT'S BEEN THE WORLD'S GREATEST JOB UNKNOWNWORD . IT'S BEEN THE TIDE THAT HAS LIFTED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE LARGEST MIDDLE-CLASS IN HISTORY . WE HAVE NOT COME THIS FAR BECAUSE WE PRACTICE SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST . AMERICA IS AMERICA BECAUSE WE BELIEVE IN CREATING A UNKNOWNWORD IN WHICH ALL CAN SUCCEED . OUR FREE MARKET WAS NEVER MEANT TO BE A FREE UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE WHATEVER YOU CAN GET , HOWEVER YOU CAN GET IT . AND SO FROM TIME TO TIME , WE HAVE PUT IN PLACE CERTAIN RULES OF THE ROAD TO MAKE COMPETITION FAIR , AND OPEN , AND HONEST . WE HAVE DONE THIS NOT TO STIFLE PROSPERITY OR LIBERTY , BUT TO FOSTER THOSE THINGS AND ENSURE THAT THEY ARE SHARED AND SPREAD AS WIDELY AS POSSIBLE . IN RECENT YEARS , WE HAVE SEEN A DANGEROUS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE RULES AND PRINCIPLES THAT HAVE ALLOWED OUR MARKET TO WORK AND OUR ECONOMY TO THRIVE . INSTEAD OF THINKING ABOUT WHAT'S GOOD FOR AMERICA OR WHAT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS , A MENTALITY HAS CREPT INTO CERTAIN CORNERS OF WASHINGTON AND THE BUSINESS WORLD THAT SAYS , "WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD ENOUGH ." IN OUR GOVERNMENT , WE SEE CAMPAIGN CONTRIBUTIONS AND LOBBYISTS USED TO CUT CORNERS AND WIN FAVORS THAT UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AGAINST BUSINESSES AND CONSUMERS WHO PLAY BY THE RULES . MASSIVE TAX CUTS ARE UNKNOWNWORD OUTSIDE THE BUDGET UNKNOWNWORD AND ACCOUNTING UNKNOWNWORD ARE USED TO HIDE THE FULL COST OF THIS WAR . IN THE BUSINESS WORLD , IT'S A MENTALITY THAT SEES CONFLICTS OF INTEREST AS OPPORTUNITIES FOR PROFIT . THE QUICK KILL IS PRIZED WITHOUT REGARD TO LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES FOR THE FINANCIAL SYSTEM AND THE ECONOMY . AND WHILE THIS MAY BENEFIT THE FEW WHO PUSH THE UNKNOWNWORD AS FAR AS IT WILL GO , IT'S DOESN'T BENEFIT AMERICA AND IT DOESN'T BENEFIT THE MARKET . JUST BECAUSE IT MAKES MONEY DOESN'T MEAN IT'S GOOD FOR BUSINESS . IT'S BAD FOR BUSINESS WHEN BOARDS ALLOW THEIR EXECUTIVES TO SET THE PRICE OF THEIR STOCK OPTIONS TO GUARANTEE THAT UNKNOWNWORD GET RICH REGARDLESS OF HOW THEY PERFORM . IT'S BAD FOR THE BOTTOM LINE WHEN CEOS RECEIVE MASSIVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AFTER LETTING DOWN SHAREHOLDERS , UNKNOWNWORD WORKERS AND UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PENSIONS ; OR WHEN THEY THROW UNKNOWNWORD BIRTHDAY PARTIES WITH COMPANY FUNDS . IT'S BAD FOR COMPETITION WHEN YOU HAVE AN ADMINISTRATION THAT'S WILLING TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AFTER UNKNOWNWORD WITH BARELY ANY UNKNOWNWORD . SUCH AN APPROACH UNKNOWNWORD INNOVATION , IT ROBS CONSUMERS OF CHOICE , IT MEANS HIGHER PRICES , AND WE HAVE TO GUARD AGAINST IT . AND IT'S BAD FOR THE MARKET WHEN THERE ARE OVER UNKNOWNWORD TRILLION WORTH OF UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CORPORATE TAX CODE , OR WHEN SOME COMPANIES GET TO SET UP A UNKNOWNWORD IN A FOREIGN COUNTRY TO AVOID PAYING ANY TAXES AT ALL . THIS MEANS A GREATER SHARE OF TAXES FOR AMERICANS AND SMALL BUSINESSES THAT ARE TRYING TO COMPETE BUT CAN'T AFFORD TO LOBBY THEIR WAY TO MORE UNKNOWNWORD . IT ALSO MEANS THAT INVESTMENT GOES TO THE COMPANIES THAT ARE BEST CONNECTED INSTEAD OF THE ONES THAT ARE MOST PRODUCTIVE . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TELLS US SPECIAL INTEREST POLITICS UNKNOWNWORD THE FREE MARKET . AFTER ALL , WHY WOULD AN OIL COMPANY INVEST IN RESEARCH FOR ALTERNATIVE FUELS THAT COULD SAVE OUR ENVIRONMENT WHEN THEY CAN GET BILLIONS OF DOLLARS IN SUBSIDIES TO KEEP UNKNOWNWORD FOR OIL AND GAS ? THESE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD PRACTICES ARE WASTEFUL , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE VERY SPIRIT OF UNKNOWNWORD . THEY BENEFIT THE UNKNOWNWORD FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF HARDWORKING AMERICANS AND ENTREPRENEURS WHO PLAY BY THE RULES . IN FACT , THE DANGER WITH THIS MENTALITY ISN'T JUST THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD , IT'S THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD OUR MARKETS . MARKETS CAN'T THRIVE WITHOUT THE TRUST OF INVESTORS AND THE PUBLIC . AT A MOST BASIC LEVEL , CAPITAL MARKETS WORK BY UNKNOWNWORD CAPITAL TO THE PLACE WHERE IT IS MOST PRODUCTIVE . WITHOUT TRANSPARENCY , THAT CANNOT HAPPEN . IF THE INFORMATION IS FLAWED , IF THERE IS FRAUD , OR IF THE RISKS FACING FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS ARE NOT FULLY UNKNOWNWORD , PEOPLE STOP INVESTING BECAUSE THEY FEAR THEY'RE BEING HAD . WHEN THE PUBLIC TRUST IS UNKNOWNWORD BADLY ENOUGH , IT CAN BRING FINANCIAL MARKETS TO THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . WE ALL SUFFER WHEN WE DO NOT ENSURE THAT MARKETS ARE UNKNOWNWORD , OPEN AND HONEST . WE SAW THIS DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD BOOM OF THE UNKNOWNWORD WHEN CONFLICTS OF INTEREST BETWEEN SECURITIES UNKNOWNWORD , WHOSE RESEARCH WAS SUPPOSED TO GUIDE INVESTORS , AND THE BANKS THEY WORKED FOR LED INVESTORS TO DOUBT THE MARKETS IN GENERAL . WE SAW IT DURING THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD SCANDALS WHEN MAJOR PUBLIC COMPANIES UNKNOWNWORD PUMPED UP THEIR EARNINGS , UNKNOWNWORD THEIR LOSSES AND OTHERWISE ENGAGED IN ACCOUNTING FRAUD TO MAKE THEIR PROFITS LOOK BETTER - A PRACTICE THAT ULTIMATELY LED INVESTORS TO QUESTION THE BALANCE SHEETS OF ALL COMPANIES . AND WE CANNOT HELP BUT SEE SOME UNKNOWNWORD OF THESE PRACTICES WHEN WE LOOK AT THE SUBPRIME MORTGAGE UNKNOWNWORD TODAY . SUBPRIME LENDING STARTED OFF AS A GOOD IDEA - HELPING AMERICANS BUY HOMES WHO COULDN'T UNKNOWNWORD AFFORD TO . FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS CREATED NEW FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS THAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD THESE LOANS , UNKNOWNWORD THEM INTO FINER AND FINER RISK UNKNOWNWORD AND SPREAD THEM OUT AMONG INVESTORS AROUND THE COUNTRY AND AROUND THE WORLD . IN THEORY , THIS SHOULD HAVE ALLOWED MORTGAGE LENDING TO BE LESS RISKY AND MORE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT AS CERTAIN LENDERS AND BROKERS BEGAN TO SEE HOW MUCH MONEY COULD BE MADE , THEY BEGAN TO LOWER THEIR STANDARDS . SOME UNKNOWNWORD BEGAN INFLATING THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO GET THE DEALS DONE . SOME BORROWERS STARTED CLAIMING INCOME THEY DIDN'T HAVE JUST TO UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE LOANS , AND SOME WERE ENGAGING IN IRRESPONSIBLE UNKNOWNWORD . BUT MANY BORROWERS WERE TRICKED INTO UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE FINE PRINT . AND UNKNOWNWORD AGENCIES BEGAN RATING BUNDLES OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF THESE LOANS AS UNKNOWNWORD EVEN THOUGH THEY WERE VERY UNKNOWNWORD . MOST EVERYONE KNEW THAT SOME OF THESE DEALS WERE JUST TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE , BUT ALL THAT MONEY UNKNOWNWORD IN MADE IT UNKNOWNWORD TO LOOK THE OTHER WAY AND IGNORE THE UNSCRUPULOUS PRACTICE OF SOME BAD UNKNOWNWORD AND YET , TIME AND AGAIN WE WERE WARNED THIS COULD HAPPEN . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THE FORMER UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNOR WHO UNKNOWNWORD PASSED AWAY TWO WEEKS AGO , WROTE AN ENTIRE BOOK UNKNOWNWORD THIS VERY SITUATION . UNKNOWNWORD CALLS FOR BETTER DISCLOSURE AND STRONGER UNKNOWNWORD WERE MET WITH MILLIONS IN MORTGAGE INDUSTRY LOBBYING . FAR TOO MANY CONTINUED TO PUT THEIR OWN SHORT-TERM GAIN AHEAD OF WHAT THEY KNEW THE LONG-TERM CONSEQUENCES WOULD BE WHEN THOSE RATES UNKNOWNWORD . THOSE CONSEQUENCES ARE NOW CLEAR : NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD MILLION HOMEOWNERS COULD LOSE THEIR HOMES . MILLIONS MORE WHO HAD NOTHING TO DO WITH THIS COULD SEE THE VALUE OF THEIR OWN HOME DECLINE - WITH SOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD A COST OF NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD BILLION , UNKNOWNWORD IN LOST HOME EQUITY . THE PROJECTED COST TO INVESTORS IS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD BILLION UNKNOWNWORD . AND THE IMPACT ON THE HOUSING MARKET AND WIDER ECONOMY HAS BEEN SO GREAT THAT SOME ECONOMISTS ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD A POSSIBLE RECESSION - A UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF US HOPE DOES NOT COME TO PASS . THERE ARE A NUMBER OF LESSONS THAT WE MUST LEARN FROM THIS GOING FORWARD . WE KNOW THAT MUCH OF THIS COULD HAVE BEEN UNKNOWNWORD IF THE MARKET UNKNOWNWORD WITH MORE HONESTY AND ACCOUNTABILITY . WE ALSO KNOW WE WOULD HAVE BEEN FAR BETTER OFF IF THERE WERE GREATER TRANSPARENCY AND MORE INFORMATION HAD BEEN AVAILABLE TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO THAT EXTENT , I BELIEVE THERE ARE A FEW STEPS WE SHOULD TAKE TO PREVENT FUTURE CRISES OF THIS KIND AND RESTORE SOME MEASURE OF PUBLIC TRUST IN THE MARKET : FIRST , WE NEED MORE DISCLOSURE AND ACCOUNTABILITY IN THE HOUSING MARKET . TO ENSURE THAT POTENTIAL HOMEOWNERS AREN'T TRICKED INTO UNKNOWNWORD LOANS THEY CAN'T AFFORD , I'VE PROPOSED UNKNOWNWORD THE CURRENT MORTGAGE RULES TO ESTABLISH A FEDERAL DEFINITION OF MORTGAGE FRAUD AND UNKNOWNWORD TOUGH PENALTIES AGAINST LENDERS WHO UNKNOWNWORD ACT IN BAD FAITH . I'VE ALSO PROPOSED A HOME SCORE SYSTEM THAT WOULD CREATE A UNKNOWNWORD , STANDARDIZED UNKNOWNWORD FOR HOME MORTGAGES , UNKNOWNWORD OF LIKE THE UNKNOWNWORD . THIS WOULD EMPOWER AMERICANS TO MAKE SMART DECISIONS BY ALLOWING PROSPECTIVE BUYERS TO EASILY UNKNOWNWORD VARIOUS MORTGAGE PRODUCTS SO THEY CAN FIND OUT WHETHER THEY CAN AFFORD THE PAYMENTS . AND I BELIEVE WE SHOULD FINALLY UNKNOWNWORD THE MEANINGFUL MORTGAGE DISCLOSURE LAWS THAT THE MORTGAGE INDUSTRY HAS BEEN LOBBYING AGAINST FOR FAR TOO LONG . SECOND , I BELIEVE THAT IF WE HOPE TO RESTORE TRUST IN THE MARKETS , WE MUST BE ABLE TO TRUST THE JUDGMENT OF OUR RATING AGENCIES . THE FAILURE OF GOVERNMENT TO EXERCISE ADEQUATE UNKNOWNWORD OVER THE RATING AGENCIES WILL COST INVESTORS AND PUBLIC PENSION FUNDS BILLIONS OF DOLLARS - LOSSES WE HAVE NOT YET FULLY RECOGNIZED . WE CANNOT LET THE PUBLIC TRUST BE LOST BY A CONFLICT OF INTEREST BETWEEN THE RATING AGENCIES AND THE PEOPLE THEY'RE RATING . AS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD RECENTLY REMINDED US , THIS HAPPENED WHEN RATING AGENCIES CONTINUED TO GIVE A ROSY UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD DESPITE ITS IMPENDING BANKRUPTCY . AND OF COURSE WE SAW IT THIS YEAR WHEN SUBPRIME MORTGAGE LOANS CONTINUED TO RECEIVE STRONG UNKNOWNWORD DESPITE UNKNOWNWORD WARNINGS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE MORTGAGES AND THE IMPENDING UNKNOWNWORD OF THE HOUSING MARKET . HERE'S THE REAL DANGER - IF THE PUBLIC COMES TO VIEW THIS LIKE THE ACCOUNTING UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , THE MARKETS WILL BE UNKNOWNWORD BY A CRISIS IN CONFIDENCE . WE MUST TAKE STEPS TO AVOID THAT AT ALL COSTS , AND THAT IS WHY I BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE AN IMMEDIATE INVESTIGATION OF THE RELATIONSHIP AND BUSINESS PRACTICES OF RATING AGENCIES AND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD . THE THIRD THING WE NEED TO DO IS LOOK AT OTHER AREAS IN THE MARKET WHERE A LACK OF TRANSPARENCY COULD LEAD TO SIMILAR PROBLEMS . MANY OF THE PEOPLE WHO HOLD THESE SUBPRIME MORTGAGES ARE NOW UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEBT TO CREDIT CARDS , AND IF THEY DO NOT UNDERSTAND THE COMMITMENTS THEY'RE TAKING ON , OR ARE UNKNOWNWORD TO PREDATORY PRACTICES , THIS COULD UNKNOWNWORD INTO A SECOND CRISIS DOWN THE ROAD . THAT'S WHY I'M PROPOSING A FIVE-STAR CREDIT CARD RATING SYSTEM TO INFORM CONSUMERS ABOUT THE LEVEL OF RISK INVOLVED IN EVERY CREDIT CARD THEY SIGN UP FOR , INCLUDING HOW EASILY THE COMPANY CAN CHANGE THE INTEREST RATE . IF MORE AMERICANS WERE ARMED WITH THIS KIND OF INFORMATION BEFORE THEY UNKNOWNWORD RISKY MORTGAGE LOANS , THE CURRENT CRISIS MIGHT NOT HAVE HAPPENED . NOW THAT SO MANY ARE IN DEBT , WE SHOULDN'T LET THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD STANDARDS CREATE ANOTHER . FINALLY , WHILE IT'S NOT MY PLACE TO UNKNOWNWORD ON THE ACTIONS OF THE UNKNOWNWORD , I HAVE HEARD MANY OF YOU SAY THAT YOU HOPE FOR A UNKNOWNWORD RATE CUT TOMORROW TO UNKNOWNWORD THE MARKET UNKNOWNWORD . BUT I ALSO KNOW THAT THERE ARE NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD MILLION AMERICANS WHO MAY LOSE THEIR HOMES NO MATTER WHAT HAPPENS TOMORROW . AND SO FOR THOSE INSTITUTIONS THAT ARE HOLDING THESE MORTGAGES , I ASK THEM TO SHOW SOME FLEXIBILITY TO FOLKS TRYING TO SELL OR REFINANCE THEIR HOUSES . THEY ARE IN THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS COMPANIES ARE , BUT THEY DON'T HAVE THE SAME RESOURCES AVAILABLE TO PROTECT THEMSELVES . NOW , IN ADDITION TO THESE IMMEDIATE STEPS , I ALSO BELIEVE THERE IS A LARGER LESSON TO BE LEARNED FROM THE SUBPRIME CRISIS . IN THIS MODERN , INTERCONNECTED ECONOMY , THERE IS NO UNKNOWNWORD LINE BETWEEN MAIN STREET AND WALL STREET . THE DECISIONS THAT ARE MADE IN NEW UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD FUNDS MATTER AND HAVE CONSEQUENCES FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS ACROSS THE COUNTRY . AND WHETHER THOSE AMERICANS KEEP THEIR HOMES OR THEIR JOBS ; WHETHER THEY CAN SPEND WITH CONFIDENCE AND AVOID FALLING INTO DEBT - THAT MATTERS AND HAS CONSEQUENCES FOR THE ENTIRE MARKET . WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN EACH OTHER'S SUCCESS . WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN ENSURING THAT THE MARKET IS EFFICIENT AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THAT IT UNKNOWNWORD TRUST AND CONFIDENCE ; THAT IT REWARDS THOSE WHO ARE TRULY SUCCESSFUL INSTEAD OF THOSE WHO ARE JUST SUCCESSFUL AT UNKNOWNWORD THE SYSTEM . BECAUSE IF THE LAST FEW MONTHS HAVE TAUGHT US ANYTHING , IT'S THAT WE CAN ALL SUFFER FROM THE EXCESSES OF A FEW . TURNING A BLIND EYE TO THE CRONYISM IN OUR MIDST CAN PUT US ALL IN UNKNOWNWORD . AND WE CANNOT ACCEPT THAT IN THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA . SO I PROMISE YOU THIS . I WILL BE A PRESIDENT WHO BELIEVES IN YOUR SUCCESS . I WILL VALUE YOUR CONTRIBUTION TO THIS COUNTRY AND I WILL DO WHAT I CAN TO ENCOURAGE IT , BECAUSE I UNDERSTAND THAT HOW WELL YOU DO IS INEXTRICABLY LINKED TO HOW WELL AMERICA DOES . AND I WILL ALWAYS BE A STRONG ADVOCATE FOR A MARKET THAT IS FREE AND OPEN . BUT TODAY I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN SAYING THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , WE WILL NOT TOLERATE A MARKET THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD . WE WILL NOT TOLERATE A MARKET THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD BY LOBBYISTS WHO DON'T REPRESENT THE INTERESTS OF REAL AMERICANS OR MOST BUSINESSES . AND WE WILL NOT TOLERATE "WHAT'S GOOD FOR ME IS GOOD ENOUGH " ANY LONGER - BECAUSE THE ONLY THING THAT'S GOOD ENOUGH IS WHAT'S BEST FOR AMERICA . I AM ALSO ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN DOING SOMETHING ELSE TODAY . I AM ASKING YOU TO REMIND YOURSELVES THAT IN THIS COUNTRY , WE RISE OR FALL AS ONE PEOPLE . AND I AM ASKING YOU TO JOIN ME IN UNKNOWNWORD IN A NEW ERA OF MUTUAL RESPONSIBILITY IN AMERICA . RIGHT NOW THERE ARE MILLIONS OF HARDWORKING AMERICANS WHO HAVE BEEN STRUGGLING TO GET BY FOR QUITE SOME TIME . THEY HAVE WATCHED THEIR WAGES UNKNOWNWORD AND THEIR HEALTH COSTS RISE AND THEIR PENSIONS DISAPPEAR . SOME HAVE SEEN JOBS SHIPPED OVERSEAS AND OTHERS HAVE FOUND NEW ONES THAT PAY MUCH LESS . SOME TELL THEIR CHILDREN THEY WON'T BE ABLE TO AFFORD COLLEGE THIS YEAR , OTHERS SEND THEIR UNKNOWNWORD TO A SCHOOL THAT IS CRUMBLING AROUND THEM . I MEET THESE AMERICANS EVERY SINGLE DAY - PEOPLE WHO BELIEVE THEY HAVE BEEN LEFT ON THE SIDELINES BY A GLOBAL ECONOMY THAT HAS FOREVER CHANGED THE RULES OF THE GAME . THEY UNDERSTAND THAT REVOLUTIONS IN TECHNOLOGY AND UNKNOWNWORD HAVE UNKNOWNWORD BORDERS AND UNKNOWNWORD UP NEW MARKETS AND NEW OPPORTUNITIES . THEY KNOW WE CAN'T GO BACK TO YESTERDAY OR WALL OFF OUR ECONOMY FROM EVERYONE ELSE . THEIR PROBLEM IS NOT THAT OUR WORLD IS FLAT . IT'S THAT OUR PLAYING FIELD ISN'T LEVEL . IT'S THAT OPPORTUNITY IS NO LONGER EQUAL . AND THAT'S SOMETHING WE CANNOT ACCEPT ANYMORE . FOR TOO LONG WE HAVE HAD A PRESIDENT WHO HAS UNKNOWNWORD TO THE BELIEF THAT THERE IS NOTHING AMERICA CAN DO ABOUT THIS . HE HAS LOOKED AWAY FROM THESE CHALLENGES AND PEDDLED A PHILOSOPHY OF "WHAT'S BAD FOR YOU IS NOT MY PROBLEM ." AND IF WE ARE HONEST , I THINK WE MUST ADMIT THAT THOSE WHO HAVE BENEFITED FROM THE NEW GLOBAL MARKETPLACE - AND THAT INCLUDES ALMOST EVERYONE IN THIS ROOM - HAVE NOT ALWAYS CONCERNED THEMSELVES WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD IN THIS NEW ECONOMY . THERE HAS BEEN A TENDENCY , DURING THE BOOM TIMES , TO CONSIDER THE CASUALTIES OF A CHANGING ECONOMY TO BE INEVITABLE , AND TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OR LOWER TAX RATES ON WALL STREET EARNINGS AS PART OF THE NATURAL ORDER OF THINGS . INDEED , RATHER THAN ADDRESSING THIS GROWING SENSE OF UNCERTAINTY AND UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITY FOR MILLIONS OF UNKNOWNWORD AND MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS , THIS ADMINISTRATION HAS UNKNOWNWORD THESE UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH ITS TAX POLICIES AND SPENDING PRIORITIES - TO THE POINT WHERE THERE IS GREATER INCOME INEQUALITY NOW THAN AT ANY TIME SINCE THE UNKNOWNWORD AGE . IT MAY BE TRUE , AS SOME HAVE ARGUED , THAT LARGER FORCES ARE AT WORK HERE - THAT TECHNOLOGICAL ADVANCE AND GLOBALIZATION HAVE TRIGGERED A FUNDAMENTAL CHANGE IN THE ECONOMY . IT IS TRUE AS WELL THAT WE CANNOT SIMPLY LOOK BACKWARDS FOR SOLUTIONS - TO TRY TO FENCE OFF THE WORLD BEYOND OUR BORDERS , OR TO HOPE THAT THE NEW DEAL PROGRAMS BORN OF A DIFFERENT ERA ARE , BY THEMSELVES , SOMEHOW ADEQUATE TO MEET THE CHALLENGES OF THE FUTURE . NO , WE ARE GOING TO HAVE TO ADAPT OUR INSTITUTIONS TO A NEW WORLD AS WE ALWAYS HAVE . AND IN DOING SO , WE HAVE TO REMIND OURSELVES THAT WE RISE AND FALL AS ONE NATION ; THAT A COUNTRY IN WHICH ONLY A FEW PROSPER IS UNKNOWNWORD TO OUR IDEALS AND OUR DEMOCRACY ; THAT THOSE OF US WHO HAVE BENEFITED UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE BLESSINGS OF THIS COUNTRY HAVE A SOLEMN OBLIGATION TO OPEN THE DOORS OF OPPORTUNITY , NOT JUST FOR OUR CHILDREN , BUT TO ALL OF AMERICA'S CHILDREN ; AND THAT UNLESS WE TAKE IMMEDIATE STEPS TO UNKNOWNWORD THE INTERESTS OF ALL AMERICANS IN GROWTH AND PROSPERITY , WE MAY GENERATE A POLITICAL CLIMATE THAT IS UNKNOWNWORD TO BOTH . AND SO , IN THE COMING WEEKS , I WILL BE LAYING OUT A 21ST CENTURY ECONOMIC AGENDA FOR AMERICA . IT'S AN AGENDA THAT WILL LEVEL THE PLAYING FIELD FOR MORE AMERICANS TO ENSURE THAT AMERICA CAN COMPETE AND THRIVE IN A GLOBAL ECONOMY . IT WILL FOCUS ON THREE BROAD AREAS . TOMORROW , I'LL UNKNOWNWORD OUT THE FIRST PART OF MY AGENDA - A PLAN TO MODERNIZE AND SIMPLIFY OUR TAX CODE SO THAT IT PROVIDES GREATER OPPORTUNITY AND MORE RELIEF TO MORE AMERICANS . FOR FAR TOO LONG , OUR TAX CODE HAS BEEN SO RIDDLED WITH UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT IT'S SHIFTED THE TAX BURDEN TO SMALL BUSINESSES AND MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS . AT A TIME WHEN MOST AMERICANS ARE FACING STAGNANT WAGES AND RISING COSTS , THAT'S NOT FAIR AND IT DOESN'T BENEFIT OUR ECONOMY . MY PLAN WILL GIVE A BREAK TO MIDDLE-CLASS AMERICANS , SENIORS , AND THE HOMEOWNERS WHO ARE FEELING TODAY'S ANXIETY AND UNCERTAINTY , BECAUSE I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN RESTORING THEIR CONFIDENCE AND INVESTING IN THEIR PROSPERITY . THE SECOND PART OF MY AGENDA WILL BE TO ENSURE AMERICA'S COMPETITIVE EDGE IN THE 21ST CENTURY . THIS STARTS WITH PROVIDING EVERY AMERICAN WITH A WORLD-CLASS EDUCATION FROM CRADLE TO ADULTHOOD . WE KNOW THAT IN THIS ECONOMY , COUNTRIES THAT OUT-EDUCATE US TODAY WILL OUT-COMPETE US TOMORROW . AND WE ALSO KNOW THAT CHINA IS ALREADY UNKNOWNWORD FOUR TIMES AS MANY ENGINEERS AS WE DO AND THAT OUR SHARE OF UNKNOWNWORD WITH COLLEGE DEGREES NOW FALLS SOMEWHERE BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN'T ALLOW OURSELVES TO FALL BEHIND . THAT MEANS INVESTING IN EARLY CHILD EDUCATION . IT MEANS RECRUITING AN ARMY OF NEW , QUALIFIED TEACHERS WHO WE PAY MORE AND SUPPORT MORE BECAUSE WE KNOW HOW IMPORTANT THEIR JOB IS TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY . AND IT MEANS FINALLY MAKING A COLLEGE EDUCATION AFFORDABLE AND AVAILABLE TO EVERY AMERICAN . TONY UNKNOWNWORD ONCE SAID THAT UNKNOWNWORD IS THE 21ST CENTURY WEALTH ," AND I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN NURTURING THAT TALENT IF WE HOPE TO PROSPER IN THIS CENTURY . ENSURING OUR COMPETITIVE EDGE ALSO MEANS INVESTING MORE IN THE SCIENCE AND TECHNOLOGY THAT HAS FUELED SO MUCH OF OUR NATION'S ECONOMIC GROWTH . AND ONE PLACE WHERE THAT INVESTMENT WOULD MAKE AN ENORMOUS DIFFERENCE TO THE FUTURE OF THIS COUNTRY IS IN A RENEWABLE ENERGY POLICY THAT ENDS OUR ADDICTION ON FOREIGN OIL . WE KNOW THIS ADDICTION ISN'T UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR SECURITY . WE KNOW IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE PLANET . AND I'VE TALKED TO UNKNOWNWORD CEOS AND BUSINESS LEADERS WHO KNOW IT'S NOT UNKNOWNWORD FOR OUR ECONOMY TO BE HELD HOSTAGE TO THE UNKNOWNWORD OIL MARKET . I BELIEVE THAT WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN A RENEWABLE FUTURE THAT WILL CREATE THOUSANDS OF NEW JOBS AND ENTIRE NEW INDUSTRIES THAT CAN FUEL OUR PROSPERITY WELL INTO THE NEXT CENTURY . FINALLY , THE THIRD PART OF MY AGENDA WILL BE TO MODERNIZE AND STRENGTHEN AMERICA'S SAFETY NET FOR WORKING AMERICANS . LIKE ALL OF YOU , I BELIEVE IN FREE TRADE . BUT WE HAVE TO ACKNOWLEDGE THAT FOR MILLIONS OF AMERICANS , ITS BURDENS UNKNOWNWORD ITS BENEFITS . AND SO IF WE WANT TO AVOID RISING PROTECTIONISM IN THIS COUNTRY ; IF WE EXPECT WORKING AMERICANS TO ACCEPT AND EVEN EMBRACE FREE TRADE , THEN I BELIEVE WE ALL HAVE A STAKE IN EMBRACING POLICIES THAT WILL PROVIDE THEM WITH A SENSE OF SECURITY . THAT MEANS HEALTH INSURANCE AND A PENSION THAT THEY CAN ALWAYS COUNT ON . THAT MEANS SKILLS AND TRAINING THAT CAN ACTUALLY HELP PEOPLE FIND A JOB . AND THAT MEANS WAGES THAT ACTUALLY MAKE WORK PAY . I ASK FOR YOUR SUPPORT FOR THIS ECONOMIC AGENDA , BOTH IN THIS CAMPAIGN AND IF I SHOULD GET THE CHANCE TO UNKNOWNWORD THESE POLICIES AS YOUR PRESIDENT . I WILL NOT PRETEND IT WILL COME WITHOUT COST , BUT I DO BELIEVE WE CAN DO ACHIEVE THIS IN A FISCALLY RESPONSIBLE WAY - CERTAINLY MORE SO THAN THE CURRENT ADMINISTRATION THAT'S GIVEN US DEFICITS AS FAR AS THE EYE CAN SEE . I KNOW SOME MAY SAY IT'S UNKNOWNWORD TO COME TO WALL STREET AND CALL FOR SHARED SACRIFICE SO THAT ALL AMERICANS CAN BENEFIT FROM THIS NEW ECONOMY OF OURS . BUT I BELIEVE THAT ALL OF YOU ARE AS OPEN AND WILLING TO LISTEN AS ANYONE ELSE IN AMERICA . I BELIEVE YOU CARE ABOUT THIS COUNTRY AND THE FUTURE WE ARE LEAVING TO THE NEXT GENERATION . I BELIEVE YOUR WORK TO BE A PART OF BUILDING A STRONGER , MORE UNKNOWNWORD , AND MORE JUST AMERICA . I THINK THE PROBLEM IS THAT NO ONE HAS ASKED YOU TO PLAY A PART IN THE PROJECT OF AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD . I ALSO REALIZE THAT THERE ARE SOME WHO WILL SAY THAT ACHIEVING ALL OF THIS IS FAR TOO DIFFICULT . THAT IT IS TOO HARD TO BUILD UNKNOWNWORD . THAT WE ARE TOO DIVIDED AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THINK ABOUT THE RESPONSIBILITIES WE HAVE TO EACH OTHER AND TO OUR COUNTRY . THAT THE TIMES ARE SIMPLY TOO TOUGH . BUT THEN I AM REMINDED THAT WE HAVE BEEN IN TOUGHER TIMES AND WE HAVE FACED FAR MORE DIFFICULT CHALLENGES . AND EACH TIME WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD STRONGER , MORE UNITED , AND MORE PROSPEROUS THAN THE LAST . IT IS FAITH IN THE AMERICAN IDEAL THAT CARRIES US THROUGH , AS WELL AS THE BELIEF THAT WAS UNKNOWNWORD BY FRANKLIN ROOSEVELT ALL THOSE YEARS AGO THIS WEEK : UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT AN AMERICAN HABIT ; AND IN THE STRENGTH OF GREAT HOPE WE MUST ALL SHOULDER OUR COMMON UNKNOWNWORD ." THAT IS THE STRENGTH AND THE HOPE WE SEEK BOTH TODAY - AND IN ALL THE DAYS AND MONTHS TO COME .
RED	THANK YOU FOR THAT KIND INTRODUCTION . IT IS AN HONOR TO SPEAK BEFORE THE GOLDEN STATE REPUBLICANS AT YOUR CONVENTION . I STAND BEFORE YOU AT A PERILOUS TIME , A PERILOUS TIME FOR OUR PARTY BUT , FAR MORE IMPORTANT , A PERILOUS TIME FOR OUR COUNTRY . WE FACE AN IMPLACABLE ENEMY DEDICATED TO OUR DESTRUCTION . WE FACE CRITICISM AT HOME AND ABROAD . SOME DOUBT THAT WE CAN PREVAIL AGAINST OUR ENEMIES ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS THAT OPERATE IN EUROPE , THE AMERICAS , AFRICA , THE MIDDLE EAST AND ASIA . JUST THIS WEEK , TERRORIST PLOTS WERE UNCOVERED IN DENMARK AND GERMANY THAT HAD THE POTENTIAL TO KILL HUNDREDS OR THOUSANDS DEMONSTRATING HOW SERIOUS THE THREAT IS , YET MUCH OF WASHINGTON REMAINS MIRED IN IRRESOLUTION AND DEFEATISM . THREE DECADES AGO , A VISIONARY POLITICIAN DESCRIBED THE DANGERS IN THE WORLD . IT WAS , LIKE TODAY , A TIME WHEN SOME DOUBTED AMERICA'S GOODNESS AND GREATNESS . MANY ARGUED FOR RECONCILIATION WITH OUR GLOBAL ADVERSARY . BUT THIS MAN HELD FIRM . HE DID NOT CARE WHAT EDITORIAL BOARDS WROTE ABOUT HIM . HE DID WHAT HE THOUGHT WAS RIGHT . HE CRITICIZED THE LIBERAL DEMOCRATS ' FOREIGN POLICY OF WEAKNESS AND VACILLATION . HE CALLED FOR RESOLVE AND FIRMNESS IN DEALING WITH THE SOVIET UNION . AND , HE REFUSED TO CONDEMN MILLIONS TO PERPETUAL COMMUNIST TYRANNY IN THE FALSE HOPE THAT ACCOMMODATING THE SOVIET UNION WOULD CONTRIBUTE TO AMERICA'S SECURITY . FORTUNATELY , THIS MAN , GOVERNOR REAGAN , BECAME PRESIDENT REAGAN . HOW DIFFERENT WOULD OUR LIVES BE HAD HE NOT WON ELECTION IN 1980 AND 1984 ? DOES ANYONE BELIEVE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT WOULD HAVE CALLED THE SOVIET UNION AN "EVIL EMPIRE " OR WOULD HAVE STOOD UP TO THE NUCLEAR FREEZE MOVEMENT ? CAN YOU IMAGINE A LIBERAL DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENT SAYING COMMUNISM SHOULD BE LEFT ON THE ASH HEAP OF HISTORY , OR CALLING ON GORBACHEV TO TEAR DOWN THE BERLIN WALL ? WHILE MANY DEMOCRATS TRIED TO DEFUND WEAPONS SYSTEMS AND FREEDOM FIGHTERS , RONALD REAGAN WAS STEADFAST AND HE WAS RIGHT . THANKS TO HIS LEADERSHIP , THE SOVIET UNION DISSOLVED AND THE COLD WAR WAS WON ON OUR TERMS . TODAY , THE CHALLENGES ARE AT LEAST AS SEVERE AS THEY WERE WHEN RONALD REAGAN STOOD TALL . AND , TODAY , THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN REPUBLICANS AND DEMOCRATS ON NATIONAL SECURITY ARE EVERY BIT AS STARK AS THEY WERE 30 YEARS AGO . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES VOTE AGAINST FUNDING FOR OUR TROOPS ENGAGED IN WAR IN AFGHANISTAN AND IRAQ . TODAY , LEADING DEMOCRATIC PRESIDENTIAL CANDIDATES QUESTION WHETHER THERE IS A WAR ON TERROR , OFFER TO ENTER INTO UNCONDITIONAL NEGOTIATIONS WITH OUR WORST ENEMIES , AND TALK ABOUT COUNTERING THE FORCES OF RADICALISM BY ADVOCATING SURRENDER TO THEM IN IRAQ . IF THE DEMOCRATS GET THEIR WAY IN IRAQ , IF WE CEDE IRAQ TO AL QAEDA , HOW LONG WILL THEY STAY THE COURSE IN AFGHANISTAN ? WE FACE GRAVE CHALLENGES IN THE MIDDLE EAST : HALTING IRAN'S NUCLEAR AMBITIONS ; PROTECTING OUR DEMOCRATIC ALLY , ISRAEL ; SUPPORTING MODERATE VOICES IN THE FACE OF THE KILLERS OF HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH ; DEFENDING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SOVEREIGNTY IN THE FACE OF SYRIAN AND IRANIAN AGGRESSION . DOES ANYONE SERIOUSLY BELIEVE THAT WE CAN BETTER MEET THOSE CHALLENGES IN THE AFTERMATH OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT IN IRAQ ? IT IS IRRESPONSIBLE TO THINK SO , AND ANY MAN OR WOMAN WHO DOES ISN'T PREPARED TO LEAD OUR COUNTRY IN THE STRUGGLE AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . THE WORLD RONALD REAGAN FACED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT IRRATIONAL . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M NOSTALGIC FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD MAN'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE MISSPENT HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH CRUELTY AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS MY FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE GLIMPSE THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT , AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT , THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE DESTABILIZING THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO DESPISES US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . AS WE MEET HERE TODAY , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GROWN SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . LIKE YOU , I WANT OUR TROOPS TO COME HOME , BUT I WANT THEM TO COME HOME WITH HONOR . THE HONOR OF VICTORY THAT IS DUE ALL OF THOSE W UNKNOWNWORD HAVE PAID WITH THE ULTIMATE SACRIFICE SO THAT SACRIFICE IS NOT IN VAIN . WE HAVE NEW COMMANDERS IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY THAT I HAVE CALLED FOR FROM THE BEGINNING , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS FAILED . ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNCERTAIN , WE MUST GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND ADEQUATE TIME TO SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST MISTAKES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT AS MANY LEADING DEMOCRATS NOW ADVOCATE -- WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , EMPOWER IRAN AND OTHER HOSTILE POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY PROVOKE GENOCIDE THERE , AND DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION AS NEIGHBORING POWERS COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAVORED FACTIONS . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY DRAW US INTO A WIDER AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD IMPOSE EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . LET ME BE CLEAR : CHOOSING TO LOSE IN IRAQ WOULD HAND A VICTORY TO THE RADICALS IN CONTROL OF IRAN . AS IRAN'S PRESIDENT RECENTLY UNKNOWNWORD , "SOON WE WILL SEE A HUGE POWER VACUUM IN THE REGION [AND ] WE ARE PREPARED TO FILL THE GAP ." IRAN HAS BEEN ENGAGED IN A UNKNOWNWORD WAR AGAINST OUR FORCES IN IRAQ FOR YEARS . THEY ARE ACTIVELY UNKNOWNWORD SUNNI AND SHIA RADICALS WITH ADVANCED WEAPONS AND ON THE GROUND TRAINING . TWENTY SEVEN YEARS AGO , THE RADICAL UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAN RELEASED AMERICAN HOSTAGES HELD ILLEGALLY FOR MORE THAN 400 DAYS RATHER THAN FACE PRESIDENT REAGAN . IT WAS THE FIRST VICTORY OF HIS PRESIDENCY AND WE SHOULD HEED THE LESSON IT HOLDS FOR DEALING WITH IRAN TODAY : DETERMINATION AND RESOLVE , NOT ACCOMMODATION AND APPEASEMENT , ARE WHAT UNKNOWNWORD HEEDS . RONALD REAGAN WARNED OF THE NEED FOR FIRMNESS AND VIGILANCE IN THE UNKNOWNWORD . UNFORTUNATELY , WE DID NOT HEED HIS WISDOM AND WE PAID A HORRIBLE PRICE FOR WEAKNESS AND INATTENTION TOWARD THE THREAT POSED BY ISLAMIC EXTREMISM IN THE 1990S . BUT TODAY , OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE EVEN MORE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT AND WILL NOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT . I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . AND I BELIEVE THAT IF WE PERSEVERE WE CAN SUCCEED ON THE BATTLEFIELD OF IRAQ AND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISM . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT IS TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I POSSESS , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A PROSPECT FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . OUR MILITARY MEN AND WOMEN HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT BEFALL US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL CHOSEN . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION OF THE BEST UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND COSTLY CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE FOR US AND FOR THE WORLD . IN UNKNOWNWORD , RONALD REAGAN GAVE HIS FAMOUS "SHINING CITY UPON A HILL " SPEECH AND CONCLUDED BY SAYING : "WE CANNOT ESCAPE OUR DESTINY , NOR SHOULD WE TRY TO DO SO . THE LEADERSHIP OF THE FREE WORLD WAS THRUST UPON US IN THE LITTLE HALL OF PHILADELPHIA . IN THE DAYS FOLLOWING WORLD WAR II , WHEN THE ECONOMIC STRENGTH AND POWER OF AMERICA WAS ALL THAT STOOD BETWEEN THE WORLD AND THE RETURN TO THE DARK AGES , POPE UNKNOWNWORD XII SAID , THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE A GREAT GENIUS FOR SPLENDID AND UNSELFISH ACTIONS . INTO THE HANDS OF AMERICA , GOD HAS PLACED THE DESTINIES OF AN AFFLICTED MANKIND .' WE ARE INDEED , AND WE ARE TODAY , THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH ." IT WAS MY PRIVILEGE TO HEAR GOVERNOR REAGAN DELIVER THAT SPEECH . I HAD RECENTLY BEEN RELEASED FROM A LONG INVOLUNTARY UNKNOWNWORD AND WAS UNKNOWNWORD AS GOVERNOR REAGAN'S GUEST . HIS WORDS RING TRUE TODAY WHEN , ONCE AGAIN , IT FALLS TO AMERICA TO LEAD THE WORLD AGAINST A GLOBAL THREAT AS THE LAST BEST HOPE OF MAN ON EARTH . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY THAT HAS SACRIFICED SO MUCH FOR THE CAUSE OF FREEDOM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE BRAVER OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE MY INSPIRATION . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU .
RED	UNKNOWNWORD MORNING , AND THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF BEING HERE WITH YOU FOR THIS UNKNOWNWORD GENERAL CONFERENCE . I AM PROUD TO ADDRESS SUCH A DISTINGUISHED GROUP OF PATRIOTS . "I AM HERE , IN PART , TO SAY THANK YOU FOR YOUR SERVICE AND YOUR SACRIFICE ON BEHALF OF OUR BELOVED COUNTRY . EVERY AMERICAN WHO UNDERSTANDS THE TRUE VALUE OF FREEDOM , AND THE PRICE THAT MUST BE PAID TO PRESERVE IT , UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD DEBT OF GRATITUDE TO EACH YOU AND TO ALL OF THE BRAVE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD " YOU ARE PRIVILEGED TO LEAD . THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD ARE A NATIONAL TREASURE . "I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY WHO MADE THEIR LIVING AT UNKNOWNWORD IN DEFENSE OF OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . MY GRANDFATHER WAS A NAVAL UNKNOWNWORD ; MY FATHER A UNKNOWNWORD . THEIR RESPECT FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY LIFE . AND SO IT WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD FIND A PLACE IN MY FAMILY'S PROFESSION , AND THAT OCCUPATION WOULD ONE DAY TAKE ME TO WAR . UNKNOWNWORD WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF YOU . YOUR AMBITIONS MIGHT NOT HAVE LED YOU TO WAR ; THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU SOUGHT WERE NOT KEPT UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . MANY OF YOU WERE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU ANSWERED THE CALL WHEN IT CAME ; TOOK UP ARMS AND SERVED FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S SAKE ; AND FOUGHT BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED AMERICA'S SECURITY WAS AS MUCH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS IT WAS THE PROFESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME , YOU BUILT A BETTER A COUNTRY THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED . "I DO NOT MEAN TO UNKNOWNWORD THE VIRTUES OF THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER . I CONSIDER MY UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR RANKS TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF MY LIFE . THE UNKNOWNWORD WAS AND STILL REMAINS THE WORLD I KNOW BEST AND LOVE MOST . "THE WORLD HAS CHANGED DRAMATICALLY SINCE SEPTEMBER 11 , 2001 . TODAY , THE NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD ROLE UNKNOWNWORD , IN MANY RESPECTS , THE ROLE IT PERFORMED IN WORLD WAR II , WHEN GUARD UNKNOWNWORD FOUGHT IN EVERY UNKNOWNWORD AND EVERY MAJOR CAMPAIGN . UNKNOWNWORD SUCH AS COMPANY A OF THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD BOYS " OF THE VIRGINIA NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD 6 , UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TO 9/11 , A LOT OF US DIDN'T ALWAYS FULLY APPRECIATE THE POWER AND POTENTIAL OF THE GUARD , AND WHAT IT MIGHT ONE DAY BE CALLED UPON TO DO . BUT MY FRIENDS , WE UNDERSTAND IT NOW . TIMES HAVE UNKNOWNWORD ALL UNDERSTAND THAT NOW . UNKNOWNWORD , THOUSANDS OF NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN ONCE AGAIN FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR ACTIVE COMPONENT COMRADES ON EVERY BATTLEFIELD IN THE WAR AGAINST UNKNOWNWORD ISLAM . FROM THE MOUNTAINS OF AFGHANISTAN TO THE BACK UNKNOWNWORD OF IRAQ , GUARD AND RESERVE PERSONNEL ARE ENGAGED IN EVERY UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS CONFLICT . UNKNOWNWORD NATIONAL GUARD SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN , TOGETHER WITH THE RESERVE FORCES , ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NEXT GREAT GENERATION . YOU ARE THE ROLE MODELS OF FREEDOM , WHO BRAVELY SET ASIDE SELF-INTEREST , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HOME , THE ECONOMIC SECURITY OF YOUR JOBS AND ENTERPRISES , AND THE COMPANY OF YOUR FAMILIES TO UNKNOWNWORD THE HARD WORK OF UNKNOWNWORD DO YOUR PART IN PRESERVING OUR PRECIOUS GIFT OF LIBERTY , PROTECTING OUR CHERISHED VALUES , AND SECURING THE LIFE AND PROPERTY OF FELLOW HUMAN BEINGS , OFTEN BY UNKNOWNWORD YOUR OWN . "THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD REPRESENT THE VERY BEST OF WHAT IT MEANS TO BE AN AMERICAN AND WHAT OUR COUNTRY IS TRULY ALL UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE OF EVERY RACE , CREED , COLOR , AND ETHNIC BACKGROUND , WHO REGARD IT AS THEIR SACRED DUTY NOT SIMPLY TO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE RIGHTS AND PRIVILEGES OF CITIZENSHIP , BUT TO ANSWER ITS OBLIGATIONS . UNKNOWNWORD MATTER THE DANGER TO OUR SECURITY OR UNKNOWNWORD HOME OR UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE VIOLENT FOES OF FREEDOM OR THE UNKNOWNWORD FORCES OF UNKNOWNWORD , WHEREVER AND WHENEVER AMERICA HAS CALLED , THE NATIONAL GUARD HAS ANSWERED . YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN READY . YOU HAVE ALWAYS BEEN THERE . UNKNOWNWORD EVERYONE IN THE MILITARY UNKNOWNWORD YOU ARE GUARD , ACTIVE , OR UNKNOWNWORD ARE DIFFICULT TIMES . WE ARE A NATION AT WAR , AND WE HAVE ASKED OF OUR MEN AND WOMEN OF THE ARMED FORCES AN ALMOST UNPRECEDENTED LEVEL OF COMMITMENT AND SACRIFICE . EXTENDED UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD COMBAT TOURS HAVE BECOME THE STANDARD RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION . UNKNOWNWORD THE FACE OF THESE DEMANDS , THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE GUARD AND ACTIVE UNKNOWNWORD DISTINCTION THAT ONCE WAS SO UNKNOWNWORD NOW VIRTUALLY UNKNOWNWORD . IN 2005 , ARMY NATIONAL GUARD BRIGADES MADE UP MORE THAN 50 % OF THE COMBAT UNKNOWNWORD IN IRAQ . NOT SINCE UNKNOWNWORD HAVE WE ASKED SO MUCH OF THE GUARD , NOT ONLY OVERSEAS BUT AT HOME WHERE THE GUARD MUST CONTINUE TO FULFILL ITS CRITICAL DUTIES SECURING THE HOMELAND FROM ATTACK , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT THREATEN LIVES AND PROPERTY ALMOST EVERY DAY . UNKNOWNWORD FOR AMERICA , TODAY THE MEN AND WOMEN OF THE NATIONAL GUARD , ARE CUT FROM THE SAME PATRIOTIC UNKNOWNWORD AS THEIR UNKNOWNWORD WHO ANSWERED THE CALL AT CONCORD AND UNKNOWNWORD HILL , UNKNOWNWORD AND COLD UNKNOWNWORD , THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD ARE MEN LIKE MASTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD SPECIAL TACTICS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD AIR UNKNOWNWORD , IN MARCH 2002 , UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD IN AN ATTEMPT TO RESCUE TWO UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN SERVICEMEN FROM A UNKNOWNWORD AREA OF AFGHANISTAN UNKNOWNWORD WITH AL UNKNOWNWORD AND TALIBAN FORCES . THE UNKNOWNWORD TOOK HEAVY FIRE AND UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD SEVERAL ON BOARD . ULTIMATELY , SEVEN AMERICAN LIVES WERE LOST , BUT MANY MORE WERE UNKNOWNWORD , THANKS TO THE COURAGE OF MASTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD TOTAL UNKNOWNWORD FOR HIS OWN SAFETY , MASTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD HELPED ESTABLISH A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , THEN UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD , PROTECTED THEM FROM ENEMY FIRE , AND ESTABLISHED UNKNOWNWORD COLLECTION POINTS . BUT THAT WAS NOT ENOUGH FOR THIS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ." THIS WAS A UNKNOWNWORD FOR SURVIVAL , AND MASTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE SUCCESS OF HIS TEAM BY GATHERING UP AMMUNITION AND UNKNOWNWORD IT AMONG THOSE STILL ABLE TO UNKNOWNWORD SURE EVERYONE'S WEAPON WAS REPLENISHED AND NO ONE WAS LEFT UNKNOWNWORD . MASTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WAS UNKNOWNWORD WITH SAVING THE LIVES OF TEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AMERICANS . "THESE WERE THE ACTIONS OF AN AMERICAN PATRIOT , A UNKNOWNWORD AND TRUE UNKNOWNWORD WHO UNKNOWNWORD THE CREED OF THE AIR FORCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OTHERS MAY LIVE ," AND ONE WHO FOLLOWED THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL UNKNOWNWORD STATE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD LIKE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD "THE WORLD IN WHICH MANY OF US SERVED IN THE PAST WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT IRRATIONAL . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M NOSTALGIC FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD MAN'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE MISSPENT HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH CRUELTY AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS OUR FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . UNKNOWNWORD , WE GLIMPSE THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE DESTABILIZING THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO DESPISES US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . UNKNOWNWORD WE MEET , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GROWN SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL . AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING . SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . UNKNOWNWORD THE COMING MONTH WE WILL FACE A FORK IN THE ROAD . WE CAN PURSUE OUR OPPORTUNITY FOR VICTORY IN IRAQ , STRENGTHEN OUR HAND IN THE LARGER WAR AGAINST ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS , AND MAKE OUR NATION MORE SECURE . OR WE CAN FOLD OUR TENTS , EMBOLDEN OUR ENEMIES , THROW A REGION INTO UNKNOWNWORD , AND INCREASE THE RISKS FACED ON OUR HOME SOIL . WHICH WAY REQUIRES GREATER LEADERSHIP ? I PLAN TO LEAD THE FIGHT IN SEPTEMBER ON THE FLOOR OF THE UNITED STATES SENATE TO SUPPORT OUR TROOPS AND IN SUPPORT OF VICTORY AND AGAINST A PLAN FOR DEFEAT . "WE HAVE NEW COMMANDERS IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY THAT I HAVE ADVOCATED FROM THE BEGINNING OF THIS WAR , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS FAILED . ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNCERTAIN , WE MUST GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND ADEQUATE TIME TO SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST MISTAKES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT NOW WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , EMPOWER IRAN AND OTHER HOSTILE POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY PROVOKE GENOCIDE THERE , AND DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION AS NEIGHBORING POWERS COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAVORED FACTIONS . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD EVENTUALLY DRAW US INTO A WIDER AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD IMPOSE EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . "OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT . I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . "I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS . AND THAT IS TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I POSSESS , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED SO WE CAN DEFEAT OUR ENEMIES . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . "THE NEW SECURITY ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE LIVE WILL CONTINUE TO POSE GREAT CHALLENGES , AND REQUIRE THAT WE USE ALL ELEMENTS OF NATIONAL POWER TO DEFEAT RADICALISM . THE NATIONAL GUARD WILL PLAY A VITAL ROLE IN THIS UNKNOWNWORD EFFORT , PRECISELY BECAUSE ITS UNKNOWNWORD AND AIRMEN BRING SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD RANGE OF SKILLS AND UNKNOWNWORD TO THE FORCE . UNKNOWNWORD WE GO FORWARD , AMERICA MUST MAKE A NEW AND LASTING COMMITMENT TO OUR NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT THAT WILL ENSURE THE FORCE IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , TRAINED , LED , AND EQUIPPED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE GROWING UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD WE ASK OF YOU BOTH AT HOME AND ABROAD . UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT MUST BEGIN WITH OUR POLITICAL LEADERSHIP UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD MAGNITUDE OF WHAT WE ASK GUARD UNKNOWNWORD TO ACCOMPLISH WITH A FORCE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PART-TIME SOLDIERS AND AIRMEN . UNKNOWNWORD COMMITMENT MEANS PROVIDING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ACTIVE , GUARD AND RESERVE UNKNOWNWORD CONSISTENT WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD IMPOSED ON OUR MILITARY . WE MUST DO A BETTER JOB OF FOLLOWING THE UNKNOWNWORD REGARDING THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . FAILURE TO DO SO ABUSES THE TRUST OF THOSE WHO SERVE , AND IS A NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . "IT MEANS ENSURING THAT THE GUARD HAS THE PROPER EQUIPMENT WITH WHICH TO TRAIN AND UNKNOWNWORD . WE MUST NEVER , NEVER , ASK OUR YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN TO GO INTO HARM'S WAY WITHOUT THE EQUIPMENT AND TRAINING THEY NEED TO DO THEIR JOB EFFECTIVELY AND UNKNOWNWORD THE ENEMY THEY FACE IS A MILITARY FORCE , TERRORIST CELL , UNKNOWNWORD DISEASE , UNKNOWNWORD , FIRE , OR UNKNOWNWORD . "IT MEANS THAT OUR NATION'S LEADERS MUST SET UNKNOWNWORD PRIORITIES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD OF NATIONAL RESOURCES . THE CONGRESS MUST STOP FUNDING UNKNOWNWORD TO NOWHERE " AND THOUSANDS OF OTHER PORK BARREL PROJECTS WHILE WE UNKNOWNWORD OUR SERVICE MEMBERS AND FAIL TO PROVIDE WHAT THEY NEED TO DEFEND OUR NATION . "IT MEANS GETTING UNKNOWNWORD OF DEFENSE DEPARTMENT POLICIES , PRACTICES , AND UNKNOWNWORD THAT FAIL TO PROMOTE A UNKNOWNWORD TOTAL FORCE BASED ON COOPERATION , UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE MUTUAL RESPECT THAT ALL UNKNOWNWORD HAVE EARNED WITH THEIR BLOOD AND BRAVERY . IT MEANS ESTABLISHING A NEW UNKNOWNWORD WITH OUR GUARD AND RESERVE COMPONENT PERSONNEL TO ENSURE THEY HAVE THE PAY THEY DESERVE , THE CAREER OPPORTUNITIES THEY UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE LEVEL OF SERVICE THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR TIME , CAPABILITY , AND NEED . IT MEANS MAKING CERTAIN THAT OUR GUARD AND RESERVE MEMBERS , AND THEIR FAMILIES , RECEIVE THE PROPER HEALTH CARE THEY DESERVE AND HAVE BEEN PROMISED . IT MEANS UNKNOWNWORD THAT ALL INJURED SERVICE MEMBERS ARE TREATED WITH EQUAL CARE AND DIGNITY . "AND , MY FRIENDS , IT MEANS A NATIONAL LEADERSHIP THAT RESPECTS AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR GOVERNORS AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AS UNKNOWNWORD IN NATIONAL AND HOMELAND SECURITY UNKNOWNWORD , RATHER THAN AS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . AS FAR AS I'M CONCERNED PART OF THAT ESSENTIAL EFFORT MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD THE CHIEF OF THE NATIONAL GUARD UNKNOWNWORD THE FOURTH STAR THAT THE POSITION UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD THE CHARTER OF THE UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD IT WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD AND IMPORTANCE OF ITS MISSION TODAY . UNKNOWNWORD THESE IMPERATIVES WILL REQUIRE BREAKING OLD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THINKING , AND UNDERSTANDING THE NEW CAPABILITIES THAT ARE SO VITAL IN THE MODERN SECURITY ENVIRONMENT . IT WILL REQUIRE LESS PARTISANSHIP AND GREATER POLITICAL WILL . ABOVE ALL , IT DEMANDS STRONG LEADERSHIP AT ALL LEVELS OF GOVERNMENT AND THE MILITARY . UNKNOWNWORD GREAT CHALLENGES , EMERGE GREAT OPPORTUNITIES . OURS IS A TIME OF UNPRECEDENTED CHALLENGE . WITH IT COMES THE OPPORTUNITY TO MAKE OUR COUNTRY SAFER , THE WORLD BETTER , AND THE FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD . WE CAN DO THIS . WE CAN SEIZE THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR OUR GOOD AND THE GOOD OF OUR CHILDREN , BUT ONLY IF WE EXERCISE THE RESOLVE THAT AMERICA HAS ALWAYS DEMONSTRATED IN MOMENTOUS TIMES WHEN OUR SECURITY AND THE PROSPECTS OF THE WORLD'S FUTURE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE BALANCE . "I WOULD LIKE TO CLOSE AS I UNKNOWNWORD SAYING THANK YOU . TO THE NATIONAL UNKNOWNWORD WHO TODAY WILL WALK COMBAT PATROLS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN ; TO THOSE WHO WILL UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN SUPPORT OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD FORCES ; TO THOSE ENGAGED BACK HOME IN UNKNOWNWORD EFFORTS TO UNKNOWNWORD SUFFERING ; AND TO ALL OF YOU WHO KNOW WHAT IT MEANS TO STAND THE LONG NIGHT UNKNOWNWORD YOU . YOU UNDERSTAND BOTH THE UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD FREEDOM . YOU ARE THE BEST AMONG US . UNKNOWNWORD WHATEVER CAPACITY UNKNOWNWORD GRANTS THAT I SERVE MY COUNTRY I PLEDGE TO YOU MY UNKNOWNWORD FIDELITY TO THE CAUSE TO WHICH YOU DEVOTE YOUR UNKNOWNWORD SAFETY AND SECURITY OF UNKNOWNWORD A NATIONAL GUARD THAT WILL ALWAYS BE READY , AND ALWAYS BE THERE . "THANK YOU ."
RED	THANK YOU VERY MUCH FOR THAT WARM WELCOME , AND FOR UNKNOWNWORD ME TO ADDRESS YOU . THIS IS NOT THE FIRST TIME I HAVE HAD THE HONOR OF SPEAKING AT YOUR CONVENTION . I'M ALWAYS GRATEFUL FOR THE OPPORTUNITY , AND PLEASED TO BE IN THE COMPANY OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE HAD THE BURDEN OF SERVING OUR COUNTRY IN DISTANT LANDS , AND THE HONOR OF HAVING PROVED YOUR PATRIOTISM IN DIFFICULT CIRCUMSTANCES . I WAS BLESSED TO HAVE BEEN BORN INTO A FAMILY WHO MADE THEIR LIVING AT UNKNOWNWORD IN DEFENSE OF OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . MY GRANDFATHER WAS A NAVAL UNKNOWNWORD ; MY FATHER A UNKNOWNWORD . THEIR RESPECT FOR ME WAS ONE OF THE GREAT AMBITIONS OF MY LIFE . AND SO IT WAS NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD FIND A PLACE IN MY FAMILY'S PROFESSION , AND THAT OCCUPATION WOULD ONE DAY TAKE ME TO WAR . SUCH WAS NOT THE CASE FOR MANY OF YOU . YOUR AMBITIONS MIGHT NOT HAVE LED YOU TO WAR ; THE UNKNOWNWORD YOU SOUGHT WERE NOT KEPT UNKNOWNWORD ON UNKNOWNWORD . MANY OF YOU WERE UNKNOWNWORD . YOU ANSWERED THE CALL WHEN IT CAME ; TOOK UP ARMS FOR YOUR COUNTRY'S SAKE ; AND FOUGHT TO THE LIMIT OF YOUR ABILITY BECAUSE YOU BELIEVED AMERICA'S SECURITY WAS AS MUCH YOUR RESPONSIBILITY AS IT WAS THE PROFESSIONAL UNKNOWNWORD . AND WHEN YOU CAME HOME , YOU BUILT A BETTER A COUNTRY THAN THE ONE YOU INHERITED . I DID WHAT I HAD PREPARED MUCH OF MY LIFE TO DO . YOU DID WHAT I DID AND MORE BUT WITHOUT THE ADVANTAGES OF TRAINING AND EXPERIENCE THAT I POSSESSED . MANY OF YOU WERE KIDS WHEN YOU SAW COMBAT . I WAS THIRTY YEARS OLD . I BELIEVE YOU UNKNOWNWORD ME . I DO NOT MEAN TO UNKNOWNWORD THE VIRTUES OF THE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIER . I CONSIDER MY UNKNOWNWORD IN THEIR RANKS TO BE ONE OF THE GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF MY LIFE . THE UNKNOWNWORD WAS AND STILL REMAINS THE WORLD I KNOW BEST AND LOVE MOST . THE UNKNOWNWORD TOOK ME TO WAR . UNLESS YOU ARE A VETERAN YOU MIGHT FIND IT UNKNOWNWORD THAT I WOULD BE INDEBTED TO THE UNKNOWNWORD FOR SENDING ME TO WAR . YOU MIGHT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE SECRET BOND VETERANS SHARE IS THAT WE ENJOYED WAR . BUT AS MOST VETERANS KNOW , WAR IS AN EXPERIENCE WE WOULD NOT TRADE AND WE WOULD RATHER NOT UNKNOWNWORD . WE DO SHARE A SECRET , BUT IT IS NOT A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR . WAR IS AWFUL . WHEN NATIONS SEEK TO RESOLVE THEIR DIFFERENCES BY FORCE OF ARMS , A MILLION UNKNOWNWORD ENSUE . NOTHING , NOT THE UNKNOWNWORD WITH WHICH IT IS FOUGHT NOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE CAUSE IT SERVES , CAN UNKNOWNWORD WAR . WAR IS UNKNOWNWORD BEYOND ALL UNKNOWNWORD . WHATEVER GAINS ARE SECURED , IT IS LOSS THE VETERAN UNKNOWNWORD MOST UNKNOWNWORD . ONLY A UNKNOWNWORD OR A FRAUD UNKNOWNWORD THE CRUEL AND UNKNOWNWORD REALITY OF WAR . NEITHER DO WE SHARE UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF COMBAT . THAT UNKNOWNWORD , AFTER ALL , IS REALLY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD BACK FEAR . WE MIGHT BE PROUD TO HAVE OVERCOME THE UNKNOWNWORD OF TERROR . BUT FEW OF US ARE SO UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE EXPERIENCE TO MISTAKE IT TODAY FOR A WELCOME UNKNOWNWORD . WHAT WE SHARE IS SOMETHING HARDER TO EXPLAIN . IT IS IN PART APPRECIATION FOR HAVING SACRIFICED FOR A CAUSE GREATER THAN OURSELVES ; RELIEF FOR HAVING YOUR COURAGE AND HONOR TESTED AND UNKNOWNWORD IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CRUCIBLE OF COMBAT ; PRIDE FOR HAVING REPLACED UNKNOWNWORD AND SECURITY WITH UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD AND NOT BEEN BROKEN BY THE EXPERIENCE . BUT THE MOST IMPORTANT THING WE SHARE , THE BOND THAT IT IS OURS ALONE IS VERY DIFFICULT FOR OTHERS WHO HAVE NOT SHARED OUR EXPERIENCE TO UNDERSTAND . IF YOU WILL EXCUSE A FEW MOMENTS OF UNKNOWNWORD SELF UNKNOWNWORD , I WANT TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM A PASSAGE I WROTE IN A BOOK UNKNOWNWORD LAST WEEK , ENTITLED , HARD CALL , WHICH UNKNOWNWORD A NUMBER OF HISTORICALLY IMPORTANT DECISIONS AND HOW AND WHY THEY WERE MADE . IT'S AVAILABLE IN BETTER UNKNOWNWORD EVERYWHERE AND AT UNKNOWNWORD FOR UNKNOWNWORD , A BARGAIN AT TWICE THE PRICE . UNKNOWNWORD OPPORTUNITY ASIDE , I UNKNOWNWORD THE BOOK BECAUSE IN SEVERAL UNKNOWNWORD I TRIED TO EXPLAIN UNKNOWNWORD MY UNKNOWNWORD ABOUT WAR ; ITS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD ; THE MISTAKES THAT ARE OFTEN MADE ; THE UNKNOWNWORD OF SUCCESSFUL COMMANDERS , THE EXPERIENCE OF FIGHTING , AND THE UNIQUE PURPOSE THAT IS THE COMBAT VETERAN'S . IT IS THE LAST SUBJECT THAT INTERESTED ME AS I TRIED TO DESCRIBE THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , WHO YOU MIGHT REMEMBER WAS THE WHITE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MASSACHUSETTS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE CIVIL WAR , AND THE AFRICAN AMERICAN VOLUNTEERS HE HAD THE HONOR TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THE END , ALL SOLDIERS FIGHT FOR THE SAME CAUSE . SOME DEFEND THE RIGHT AND SOME THE WRONG . SOME EMBRACE THE CAUSE THEIR NATION SUMMONED THEM TO FIGHT . SOME UNKNOWNWORD OTHER INTERESTS OF THE STATE IN THEIR SUMMONS , LESS NOBLE OR SELFLESS PERHAPS , BUT SERVE OUT OF A SENSE OF PATRIOTIC DUTY . SOME FIGHT BECAUSE THEY ARE PROFESSIONAL SOLDIERS AND PROUD TO DO THE JOB THEY HAVE BEEN TRAINED TO DO . SOME FIGHT TO PROVE THEMSELVES OR TO UNKNOWNWORD AN INJURY TO THEIR COUNTRY'S HONOR OR THEIR OWN . SOME FIGHT BECAUSE THEY WOULD BE ASHAMED NOT TO OR TO MAKE SOMETHING OF THEMSELVES IN THE UNKNOWNWORD CHALLENGE AND UNKNOWNWORD OF COMBAT . SOME FIGHT TO MAKE THE WORLD BETTER AND SOME TO KEEP THE WORLD FROM THREATENING THEIR LITTLE PIECE OF IT . SOME FIGHT UNKNOWNWORD AND SOME UNKNOWNWORD . "BUT IN THE UPHEAVAL OF WAR , THAT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD AND DISTINCTION , THINGS CHANGE . WAR IS A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD THROUGH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO FIND TRUTH , SOME OF IT UNKNOWNWORD , SOME OF IT UNKNOWNWORD BEAUTIFUL ; TO FIND VIRTUE AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD WHERE WE NEVER EXPECTED THEM TO UNKNOWNWORD . NO OTHER HUMAN EXPERIENCE EXISTS ON THE SAME UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD IRONY THAT WAR , FOR ALL THE UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IT OCCASIONS , PROVIDES THE SOLDIER WITH EVERY UNKNOWNWORD HUMAN EXPERIENCE . EXPERIENCES THAT USUALLY TAKE A LIFETIME TO KNOW ARE ALL FELT , AND FELT UNKNOWNWORD , IN ONE UNKNOWNWORD PASSAGE OF LIFE . ANYONE WHO LOSES A LOVED ONE KNOWS WHAT GREAT UNKNOWNWORD FEELS LIKE . AND ANYONE WHO GIVES LIFE TO A CHILD KNOWS WHAT GREAT JOY FEELS LIKE . THE COMBAT VETERAN KNOWS WHAT GREAT LOSS AND GREAT JOY FEEL LIKE WHEN THEY OCCUR IN THE SAME MOMENT , THE SAME EXPERIENCE . IT CAN BE TRANSFORMING . UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE CAUSE LIBERTY , UNION , UNKNOWNWORD TYRANNY IT DOES NOT DEFINE THE EXPERIENCE OF WAR . WAR UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF GLORY , WHETHER THEY ARE GENUINE AND WORTHY OR SOMETHING LESS . WAR HAS ITS OWN TRUTHS . AND IF GLORY CAN BE FOUND IN WAR , IT IS A DIFFERENT UNKNOWNWORD ALTOGETHER . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD GLORY , UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS THE DECENCY AND LOVE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD AWFUL UNKNOWNWORD , IN UNKNOWNWORD SUFFERING , UNKNOWNWORD AND CRUELTY . IT IS THE UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE BELONG TO SOMETHING BIGGER THAN OURSELVES , THAT OUR INDIVIDUAL IDENTITY TESTED , INJURED , AND CHANGED BY WAR IS NOT OUR ONLY CHERISHED POSSESSION . THAT SOMETHING IS NOT AN IDEAL BUT A COMMUNITY , A UNKNOWNWORD OF ARMS . SOLDIERS ARE RESPONSIBLE FOR DEFENDING THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEIR WAR IS FOUGHT AND FOR WHICH THEY WILL UNKNOWNWORD DOWN THEIR LIVES . BUT IT IS THEIR WAR , AND THEY HAVE THEIR OWN UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD , CHAOS , DESTRUCTION , AND UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR , SOLDIERS ARE UNKNOWNWORD BY DUTY AND MILITARY DISCIPLINE TO ENDURE AND OVERCOME . THEIR STRONGEST LOYALTY , THE BOND THAT CANNOT BREAK , IS TO THE CAUSE THAT IS THEIRS ALONE , THE CAUSE FOR WHICH THEY ALL FIGHT : ONE ANOTHER . IT IS THROUGH LOYALTY TO COMRADES IN ARMS , THEIR UNKNOWNWORD PRIVILEGE , THAT THEY SERVE THE NATIONAL IDEAL THAT UNKNOWNWORD THEIR PERSONAL UNKNOWNWORD . WHEN WAR IS OVER , THEY MIGHT HAVE THE LARGEST BUT NOT UNKNOWNWORD CLAIM ON THE SUCCESS OF THEIR NATION'S CAUSE . BUT THEIR CLAIM IS UNKNOWNWORD OF ALL UNKNOWNWORD , ALL UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE CRUCIBLE IN WHICH IT WAS WON . FROM THAT CRUCIBLE THEY HAVE BUT ONE UNKNOWNWORD , ONE HONOR , ONE GLORY : THAT THEY HAD UNKNOWNWORD THE UNKNOWNWORD AND LOSSES OF WAR AND WERE FOUND WORTHY BY THE MEN WHO STOOD WITH THEM ." THAT IS A DISTINCTION NO OTHER AMERICANS CAN CLAIM , AND IT CAME AT A GREAT PRICE . THE SACRIFICES MADE BY VETERANS DESERVE TO BE UNKNOWNWORD IN SOMETHING MORE LASTING THAN UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD OR IN THE UNKNOWNWORD EFFECT OF A POLITICIAN'S SPEECHES . YOUR UNKNOWNWORD AND DEVOTION TO DUTY HAVE EARNED YOUR COUNTRY'S ABIDING CONCERN FOR YOUR WELFARE . AND WHEN OUR GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD TO HONOR THE COUNTRY'S DEBTS TO YOU , IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD UPON AMERICA'S HONOR . THE WALTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , I HOPE , NOT JUST GOVERNMENT BUT THE PUBLIC WHO ELECTED IT , TO OUR RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO RISKED LIFE AND UNKNOWNWORD TO MEET THEIR RESPONSIBILITIES TO US . SUCH A UNKNOWNWORD IS UNWORTHY OF THE GREATEST NATION ON EARTH . AS THE GREATEST LEADERS IN OUR HISTORY , GEORGE WASHINGTON AND ABRAHAM UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD US , CARE FOR AMERICANS WHO FOUGHT TO DEFEND US SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD AMONG THE HIGHEST OF NATIONAL PRIORITIES . THE WORLD IN WHICH MANY OF US SERVED WAS A DANGEROUS ONE , BUT MORE STABLE THAN THE WORLD TODAY . IT WAS A WORLD WHERE WE CONFRONTED A MASSIVE , ORGANIZED THREAT TO OUR SECURITY . OUR ENEMY WAS EVIL , BUT NOT IRRATIONAL . AND FOR ALL THE SUFFERING ENDURED BY CAPTIVE NATIONS ; FOR ALL THE FEAR OF GLOBAL NUCLEAR WAR ; IT WAS A WORLD MADE FAIRLY PREDICTABLE BY A STABLE BALANCE OF POWER UNTIL OUR STEADFASTNESS AND PATIENCE YIELDED AN HISTORIC VICTORY FOR OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS . THAT WORLD IS GONE , AND PLEASE DON'T MISTAKE MY REMINISCENCE AS AN INDICATION THAT I MISS IT . IF I'M NOSTALGIC FOR IT AT ALL , IT IS ONLY AN OLD MAN'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR THE TIME WHERE HE MISSPENT HIS YOUTH . THAT WORLD , AFTER ALL , HAD MUCH CRUELTY AND TERROR , SOME OF WHICH IT WAS OUR FATE TO WITNESS PERSONALLY . TODAY , WE GLIMPSE THE PROSPECT OF ANOTHER , BETTER WORLD , IN WHICH ALL PEOPLE MIGHT SOMEDAY SHARE IN THE BLESSINGS AND RESPONSIBILITIES OF FREEDOM . BUT WE ALSO FACE A THREAT , AND A LONG WAR TO DEFEAT IT , THAT IS AS DIFFICULT AND IN MANY RESPECTS MORE DESTABILIZING THAN ANY CHALLENGE WE HAVE EVER FACED . WE CONFRONT AN ENEMY THAT SO DESPISES US AND MODERNITY ITSELF THAT THEY WOULD USE ANY MEANS , UNLEASH ANY TERROR , CAUSE THE MOST UNIMAGINABLE SUFFERING TO HARM US , AND TO DESTROY THE WORLD WE HAVE TRIED THROUGHOUT OUR HISTORY TO BUILD . AS WE MEET , IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . AS WE ALL KNOW , THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS NOT GONE WELL , AND THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE GROWN SICK AND TIRED OF IT . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THE MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY COMMANDERS AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT WE CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . WE HAVE NEW COMMANDERS IN IRAQ , AND THEY ARE FOLLOWING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY THAT WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FROM THE BEGINNING , WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOESN'T STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS FAILED . ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS UNCERTAIN , WE MUST GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS AND THE AMERICANS HE HAS THE HONOR TO COMMAND ADEQUATE TIME TO SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PAST MISTAKES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . TO CONCEDE DEFEAT NOW WOULD STRENGTHEN AL QAEDA , EMPOWER IRAN AND OTHER HOSTILE POWERS IN THE MIDDLE EAST , UNLEASH A FULL SCALE CIVIL WAR IN IRAQ THAT COULD QUITE POSSIBLY PROVOKE GENOCIDE THERE , AND DESTABILIZE THE ENTIRE REGION AS NEIGHBORING POWERS COME TO THE AID OF THEIR FAVORED FACTIONS . THE CONSEQUENCES WOULD THREATEN US FOR YEARS , AND I AM CERTAIN WOULD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DRAW US INTO A WIDER AND MORE DIFFICULT WAR THAT WOULD IMPOSE EVEN GREATER SACRIFICES ON US . OUR DEFEAT IN IRAQ WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT . I WILL DO WHATEVER I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP AVERT IT . THAT IS ALL I CAN OFFER MY COUNTRY . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT AND AM HUMBLED BY IT . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY FELLOW AMERICANS , AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , AND I TRY TO TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS AND THAT IS TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I POSSESS , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A PROSPECT FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . WAR IS A TERRIBLE THING , BUT NOT THE WORST THING . YOU KNOW THAT , YOU HAVE ENDURED THE DANGERS AND DEPRIVATIONS OF WAR SO THAT THE WORST THING WOULD NOT BEFALL US , SO THAT AMERICA MIGHT BE SECURE IN HER FREEDOM . THE WAR IN IRAQ HAS DIVIDED THE AMERICAN PEOPLE , BUT IT HAS DIVIDED NO AMERICAN IN OUR ADMIRATION FOR THE MEN AND WOMEN WHO ARE FIGHTING FOR US THERE . IT IS EVERY VETERAN'S HOPE THAT SHOULD THEIR CHILDREN BE CALLED UPON TO ANSWER A CALL TO ARMS , THE BATTLE WILL BE NECESSARY AND THE FIELD WELL CHOSEN . BUT THAT IS NOT THEIR RESPONSIBILITY . IT BELONGS TO THE GOVERNMENT THAT CALLED THEM . AS IT ONCE WAS FOR US , THEIR HONOR WILL BE IN THEIR ANSWER NOT THEIR SUMMONS . WHATEVER WE THINK ABOUT HOW AND WHY WE WENT TO WAR IN IRAQ , WE ARE ALL THOSE WHO SUPPORTED THE DECISION THAT PLACED THEM IN HARM'S WAY AND THOSE WHO OPPOSED IT HUMBLED BY AND GRATEFUL FOR THEIR EXAMPLE . THEY NOW DESERVE THE DISTINCTION OF THE BEST AMERICANS , AND WE OWE THEM A DEBT WE CAN NEVER FULLY REPAY . WE CAN ONLY OFFER THE SMALL TRIBUTE OF OUR HUMILITY AND OUR COMMITMENT TO DO ALL THAT WE CAN DO , IN LESS TRYING AND COSTLY CIRCUMSTANCES , TO HELP KEEP THIS NATION WORTHY OF THEIR SACRIFICE . MANY OF THEM HAVE SERVED MULTIPLE TOURS IN IRAQ AND AFGHANISTAN . MANY HAVE HAD THEIR TOURS EXTENDED . MANY HAVE RETURNED TO COMBAT SOONER THAN THEY HAD BEEN LED TO EXPECT . IT IS A SAD AND HARD THING TO ASK SO MUCH MORE OF AMERICANS WHO HAVE ALREADY GIVEN MORE THAN THEIR FAIR SHARE TO THE DEFENSE OF OUR COUNTRY . FEW OF THEM AND THEIR FAMILIES WILL HAVE RECEIVED THE NEWS ABOUT ADDITIONAL AND LONGER UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD A FEW APPROPRIATE UNKNOWNWORD IN THE GENERAL DIRECTION OF PEOPLE LIKE ME , WHO HELPED MAKE THE DECISION TO SEND THEM THERE . AND THEN THEY SHOULDERED A RIFLE AND RISKED EVERYTHING EVERYTHING TO ACCOMPLISH THEIR MISSION , TO PROTECT ANOTHER PEOPLE'S FREEDOM AND OUR OWN COUNTRY FROM HARM . IT IS A PRIVILEGE BEYOND MEASURE TO LIVE IN A COUNTRY SERVED BY THEM . I HAVE LIVED A LONG , EVENTFUL AND BLESSED LIFE . I HAVE HAD THE GOOD FORTUNE TO KNOW PERSONALLY A GREAT MANY BRAVE AND SELFLESS PATRIOTS WHO SACRIFICED AND SHED BLOOD TO DEFEND AMERICA . BUT I HAVE KNOWN NONE BRAVER OR BETTER THAN THOSE WHO DO SO TODAY . THEY ARE OUR INSPIRATION , AS I UNKNOWNWORD ALL OF YOU WERE ONCE THEIRS . AND I PRAY TO A LOVING GOD THAT HE BLESS AND PROTECT THEM . THANK YOU .
RED	THANK YOU . THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA , HISTORY'S MOST SUCCESSFUL POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD , HAS PROVED THAT A NATION UNKNOWNWORD IN LIBERTY WILL PROVE STRONGER , MORE DECENT AND ENDURING THAN ANY NATION ORDERED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE FEW AT THE EXPENSE OF THE MANY OR MADE FROM A COMMON RACE OR CULTURE OR TO PRESERVE TRADITIONS THAT HAVE NO GREATER ATTRIBUTE THAN UNKNOWNWORD . OUR WAR WITH RADICAL ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS HAS BEEN WRONGLY DESCRIBED AS A UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS A UNKNOWNWORD OF IDEALS , NOT UNKNOWNWORD , A PROFOUND AND UNKNOWNWORD CONSEQUENTIAL UNKNOWNWORD OF IDEALS . IT IS A FIGHT BETWEEN RIGHT AND WRONG , IN WHICH UNKNOWNWORD SHOULD HAVE NO PLACE . WE ARE DEFENDING OUR SECURITY AND IDEALS FROM AN ATTACK BY THOSE WHO CONSIDER LIBERTY IMMORAL . WE'RE NOT DEFENDING AN IDEA THAT EVERY HUMAN BEING SHOULD EAT CORN UNKNOWNWORD , PLAY UNKNOWNWORD OR WATCH UNKNOWNWORD . WE'RE NOT INSISTING THAT ALL SOCIETIES BE GOVERNED BY A UNKNOWNWORD LEGISLATURE AND A UNKNOWNWORD CHIEF EXECUTIVE . WE ARE INSISTING THAT ALL PEOPLE HAVE A GOD-GIVEN RIGHT TO BE FREE , AND THAT RIGHT IS NOT SUBJECT TO THE UNKNOWNWORD AND INTERESTS AND AUTHORITY OF ANOTHER PERSON , GOVERNMENT OR CULTURE . AND CENTRAL TO OUR IDEALS IS THE SANCTITY OF PROPERTY RIGHTS . WITHOUT PRIVATE PROPERTY THERE CAN BE NO FREEDOM , AND WITHOUT FREEDOM THERE CAN BE NO AMERICA . UNKNOWNWORD ," JOHN ADAMS WROTE , UNKNOWNWORD SURELY A RIGHT OF MANKIND AS REAL AS LIBERTY ." YET TODAY PROPERTY RIGHTS COME UNDER ATTACK FROM UNKNOWNWORD THAT AFFECT EVERY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP . MR . ADAMS WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD TO LEARN WHAT BOTH THE UNITED STATES SUPREME COURT AND THE SUPREME COURT OF UNKNOWNWORD DID TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AN AMERICAN UNKNOWNWORD , IN ALLOWING THE GOVERNMENT TO SEIZE HER HOME FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT AND GAIN UNDER THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD PUBLIC USE ." THE PROTECTION OF PROPERTY RIGHTS LIES AT THE HEART OF OUR CONSTITUTIONAL SYSTEM . THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR CONSTITUTION UNKNOWNWORD UPON UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OF LEGAL RIGHTS AND INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY UNKNOWNWORD BACK TO THE UNKNOWNWORD CODE , THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE TWO UNKNOWNWORD OF JOHN UNKNOWNWORD , ALL OF WHICH RECOGNIZE THE IMPORTANCE OF PROPERTY OWNERSHIP IN A GOVERNMENTAL SYSTEM IN WHICH INDIVIDUAL LIBERTY AND THE FREE MARKET ARE UNKNOWNWORD . PROPERTY IS MORE THAN JUST LAND . PROPERTY IS BUILDINGS , UNKNOWNWORD , APARTMENT UNKNOWNWORD , RETIREMENT SAVINGS ACCOUNTS , UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNTS , FURNITURE , COMPUTERS , CARS , AND EVEN IDEAS . IN SHORT , PROPERTY IS THE FRUIT OF ONE'S LABOR . PROPERTY RIGHTS PROTECTION MEANS THAT THE INDIVIDUAL UNKNOWNWORD THE REWARDS FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD OF HIS UNKNOWNWORD , NOT THE GOVERNMENT OR THOSE WHO CONTROL THE GOVERNMENT . OUR ECONOMY IS BUILT ON THE UNKNOWNWORD OF AMERICAN WORKERS AND FUELED BY THE DREAMS OF INNOVATORS AND ENTREPRENEURS . WITHOUT SECURE PRIVATE PROPERTY , THE INCENTIVES THAT HAVE MADE AMERICA THE GREATEST EXPORTER , IMPORTER , PRODUCER , SAVER , INVESTOR , MANUFACTURER , AND INNOVATOR ON THE GLOBE WOULD UNKNOWNWORD . THIS INSIGHT HAS PRODUCED A REVOLUTION IN DEVELOPMENT STRATEGIES AROUND THE GLOBE . AFTER DECADES OF LITERALLY THROWING MONEY AT THE PROBLEM OF GLOBAL POVERTY , THE UNKNOWNWORD HAS UNKNOWNWORD TO SECURING PROPERTY RIGHTS , UNKNOWNWORD THE RULE OF LAW AND ALLOWING THE WORLD'S WORKERS TO PROFIT FROM THEIR LABOR AND RETAIN ITS REWARDS . INDEED , WHERE THE UNKNOWNWORD OF ONE'S UNKNOWNWORD ARE UNKNOWNWORD BY THE STATE AND NOT THE INDIVIDUAL , PEOPLE ARE UNKNOWNWORD . AS UNKNOWNWORD WEBSTER UNKNOWNWORD : UNKNOWNWORD THE PEOPLE HAVE PROPERTY AND THEY WILL HAVE POWER A POWER THAT WILL FOREVER BE UNKNOWNWORD TO PREVENT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THE PRESS , THE ABOLITION OF TRIAL BY UNKNOWNWORD , OR THE UNKNOWNWORD OF MANY OTHER PRIVILEGES ." IN UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , KARL MARX WROTE IN THE COMMUNIST UNKNOWNWORD : "THE THEORY OF THE UNKNOWNWORD MAY BE SUMMED UP IN A SINGLE SENTENCE : ABOLITION OF PRIVATE PROPERTY ." THE GOVERNMENT'S UNKNOWNWORD FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS , IN THE FORM OF UNKNOWNWORD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD AND THE UNKNOWNWORD OF PRIVATE HOMES FOR TROOPS WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD OR COMPENSATION , WAS THE MOTIVATING FORCE BEHIND OUR STRUGGLE TO OBTAIN INDEPENDENCE . AND IN THE YEARS AFTER ACHIEVING INDEPENDENCE , THE FOUNDERS UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE PROPERTY RIGHTS FOR WHICH THEY FOUGHT WERE PROTECTED BY OUR CONSTITUTION . THEY RECOGNIZED THAT LIBERTY AND PROPERTY RIGHTS ARE UNKNOWNWORD . AS JAMES UNKNOWNWORD STATED , "IT IS UNKNOWNWORD OBVIOUS , THAT UNKNOWNWORD AND PROPERTY ARE THE TWO GREAT UNKNOWNWORD ON WHICH GOVERNMENTS ARE TO ACT ; AND THAT THE RIGHTS OF UNKNOWNWORD , AND THE RIGHTS OF PROPERTY , ARE THE UNKNOWNWORD , FOR THE PROTECTION OF WHICH GOVERNMENT WAS UNKNOWNWORD ." ONE OF THE MOST VISIBLE PROTECTIONS FOR PROPERTY RIGHTS IS THE JUST COMPENSATION UNKNOWNWORD OF THE FIFTH AMENDMENT OF THE UNITED STATES CONSTITUTION , WHICH STATES : UNKNOWNWORD SHALL PRIVATE PROPERTY BE TAKEN FOR PUBLIC USE , WITHOUT JUST COMPENSATION ." THE PURPOSE OF THE JUST COMPENSATION UNKNOWNWORD , AS UNKNOWNWORD BY THE SUPREME COURT IN UNKNOWNWORD V . UNITED STATES , IS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT FROM UNKNOWNWORD SOME PEOPLE TO BEAR PUBLIC BURDENS , WHICH IN ALL FAIRNESS AND JUSTICE , SHOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD BY THE PUBLIC AS A WHOLE ." SOME LOCAL GOVERNMENTS HAVE SOUGHT TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD POWER AS A MEANS OF UNKNOWNWORD REVENUE BY EXPANDING THEIR TAX BASE . INDEED , THE AMERICA OF THE LATE UNKNOWNWORD AND EARLY TWENTY-FIRST CENTURIES HAS UNKNOWNWORD AN UNKNOWNWORD OF GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD THAT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD PRIVATE OWNERSHIP OF PROPERTY , OFTEN FOR UNKNOWNWORD PURPOSES THAT HAVE LITTLE TO DO WITH THE LIMITED UNKNOWNWORD OF PUBLIC USE UNKNOWNWORD BY THE UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR CONSTITUTION . THE NEED TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS , ONCE SO OBVIOUS TO UNKNOWNWORD AND ADAMS IS NOW BECOMING LOST IN A UNKNOWNWORD OF INTRUSIVE GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD . NOWHERE HAS THIS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD THAN IN THE UNKNOWNWORD DECISION ISSUED IN 2005 BY THE U.S . SUPREME COURT IN UNKNOWNWORD V . CITY OF NEW LONDON . IN UNKNOWNWORD , THE SUPREME COURT HELD THAT HELD THAT THE CONSTITUTION ALLOWS GOVERNMENTS TO SEIZE PRIVATE PROPERTY AND TRANSFER IT FROM ONE PRIVATE LAND OWNER TO ANOTHER IN THE NAME OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT . IN OTHER WORDS , AFTER THE UNKNOWNWORD DECISION , GOVERNMENTS CAN USE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD POWER TO TAKE HOMES FOR UNKNOWNWORD MORE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD USES , POWERFUL EVIDENCE , AS JUSTICE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD SUGGESTS , THAT SOMETHING IS SERIOUSLY UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE SUPREME COURT'S VISION OF THE CONSTITUTION . JUSTICE UNKNOWNWORD DAY UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THE PROBLEM VERY SIMPLY IN HER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD OPINION : UNKNOWNWORD THE BANNER OF ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT , ALL PRIVATE PROPERTY IS NOW UNKNOWNWORD TO BEING TAKEN AND UNKNOWNWORD TO ANOTHER PRIVATE OWNER , SO LONG AS IT MIGHT BE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ., GIVEN TO AN OWNER WHO WILL USE IT IN A WAY THAT THE LEGISLATURE UNKNOWNWORD MORE UNKNOWNWORD TO THE PUBLIC IN THE PROCESS ." THIS DECISION WENT WELL BEYOND WHAT THE FOUNDERS INTENDED WHEN THEY WROTE THE JUST COMPENSATION FOR PUBLIC USE UNKNOWNWORD . JUSTICE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD THAT THAT "THE BENEFICIARIES OF UNKNOWNWORD ARE LIKELY TO BE THOSE CITIZENS WITH UNKNOWNWORD INFLUENCE AND POWER IN THE POLITICAL PROCESS , INCLUDING LARGE CORPORATIONS AND DEVELOPMENT FIRMS . AS FOR THE VICTIMS , THE GOVERNMENT NOW HAS UNKNOWNWORD TO TRANSFER PROPERTY FROM THOSE WITH FEWER RESOURCES TO THOSE WITH MORE ." THE UNKNOWNWORD DECISION GIVES ANY GOVERNMENT UNKNOWNWORD THE ABILITY TO TAKE A UNKNOWNWORD PROPERTY AND GIVE IT TO A UNKNOWNWORD . IT REPRESENTS ONE OF THE MOST ALARMING UNKNOWNWORD OF FREEDOM IN OUR UNKNOWNWORD . AN EDITORIAL FROM THE UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN UNKNOWNWORD PUT IT BEST : "IF CREATING NEW TAX REVENUE IS CONSIDERED AN UNKNOWNWORD PUBLIC USE , HOMEOWNERS ' RIGHTS BECOME UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . ALMOST ANY DEVELOPMENT COULD CREATE GREATER TAX REVENUE THAN A SINGLE HOME OR TWO ." YOUR HOME , AS THE SAYING GOES , IS YOUR UNKNOWNWORD ; IT IS NOT SUPPOSED TO BE THE SITE OF A NEW SHOPPING MALL UNLESS YOU SAY SO . AND UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD DID NOT SAY SO . AND BY IGNORING HER RIGHT TO DO SO , BY REDUCING HER FREEDOM , THE COURT ALSO UNKNOWNWORD AN ASTONISHING LACK OF RESPECT FOR THE EFFICIENCY AND FAIRNESS OF FREE MARKETS . DES MOINES REGISTER UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARGUED : UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE TO SELL PROPERTY TO GOVERNMENTS AT UNKNOWNWORD RATES , UNKNOWNWORD WILL HAVE TO A PAY A HIGH ENOUGH PRICE SO THAT THE PROPERTY OWNER BECOMES A WILLING UNKNOWNWORD ." AND IF THEY STILL DON'T WANT TO SELL , WELL , THAT'S THEIR CHOICE . YET , WITHIN ONE YEAR AFTER THIS UNKNOWNWORD DECISION , REPORTS HAVE UNKNOWNWORD THAT NEARLY UNKNOWNWORD PROPERTIES NATIONWIDE WERE THREATENED OR TAKEN AS A RESULT OF THIS DECISION , UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE NUMBER OF UNKNOWNWORD . AND IT IS NOT JUST HOMEOWNERS WHO FACE THIS THREAT . IT IS A THREAT SHARED BY MILLIONS OF SMALL BUSINESS OWNERS ACROSS THE COUNTRY . FOLLOWING UNKNOWNWORD , THE MILLIONS OF PEOPLE WHO HAVE STRUGGLED TO GROW THEIR SMALL BUSINESSES MAY FIND THEMSELVES FORCED TO SELL IF THE LOCAL GOVERNMENT DECIDES THAT THEIR PROPERTY COULD BE PUT TO BETTER USE BY A BIGGER BUSINESS OR LARGER COMPETITOR . IN STATE AFTER STATE , POLLS MAKE CLEAR THAT THE AMERICAN PUBLIC UNDERSTANDS THE UNKNOWNWORD RULING IS A UNKNOWNWORD : UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF UNKNOWNWORD OPPOSE USING UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD TO TAKE PROPERTY FOR ECONOMIC DEVELOPMENT , UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF UNKNOWNWORD , 95 PERCENT OF UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD PERCENT OF UNKNOWNWORD . THE AMERICAN PUBLIC HAS SPOKEN WITH ONE VOICE , AND THEY'RE SAYING THAT THIS IS NOT RIGHT . I HAVE CO-SPONSORED LEGISLATION TO UNKNOWNWORD THIS KIND OF GOVERNMENT TAKING ; CONGRESS AND THE STATES SHOULD FOLLOW IOWA'S LEAD AND PASS SUCH LAWS . BUT LAWS DEFENDING PRIVATE PROPERTY ARE ONLY AS SECURE AS THE JUDGES THAT DEFEND THOSE LAWS . UNKNOWNWORD PASSED UNKNOWNWORD , SUPPORTED BY A FIVE TO FOUR MAJORITY WITH A TRACK RECORD OF UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE BENCH . AS PRESIDENT , I PLEDGE TO APPOINT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD JUDGES WHO RESPECT THE CONSTITUTION AND UNDERSTAND THE SECURITY OF PRIVATE PROPERTY IT PROVIDES . IF NEED BE , I WOULD SEEK TO AMEND THE CONSTITUTION TO PROTECT PRIVATE PROPERTY RIGHTS IN AMERICA . THOSE OF US PRIVILEGED TO LEAD THIS COUNTRY NEED ONLY BE MINDFUL OF WHAT HAS ALWAYS MADE US GREAT , HAVE THE COURAGE TO STAND BY OUR PRINCIPLES , HONOR OUR PUBLIC TRUST , AND KEEP OUR PROMISES TO PUT THE COUNTRY'S INTERESTS BEFORE OUR OWN . I'VE ALWAYS KEPT MY PROMISES TO MY COUNTRY . I'LL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE NOW . AND I WILL KEEP THE ONES I MAKE AS PRESIDENT . THANK YOU .
RED	"THANK YOU FOR THE HONOR OF SPEAKING BEFORE THIS GATHERING , AND THANK YOU FOR THE WORK YOU DO IN SUPPORT OF THE STATE OF ISRAEL . YOUR EFFORTS ARE NEEDED TODAY MORE THAN EVER , AS IT IS HARDER TO THINK OF A TIME IN RECENT MEMORY WHEN ISRAEL'S NATIONAL SECURITY HAS FACED SO MANY VARIED CHALLENGES . "THE JEWISH STATE HAS , OF COURSE , EXPERIENCED TOUGH TIMES BEFORE - INDEED , THEY HAVE PERHAPS BEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD RATHER THAN THE EXCEPTION . WHEN ONE THINKS BACK OVER THE CONFLICTS - UNKNOWNWORD , THE SIX DAY WAR , UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD , LEBANON , THE FIRST UNKNOWNWORD WAR , TWO UNKNOWNWORD AND LEBANON AGAIN - IT IS CLEAR THAT ISRAEL HAS BEEN CHALLENGED MORE , IN LESS TIME , THAN ANY NATION ON EARTH . SURVIVAL IN THE FACE OF SUCH UNKNOWNWORD WOULD BE UNKNOWNWORD ; UNKNOWNWORD WOULD SEEM OUT OF THE QUESTION . UNKNOWNWORD ISRAEL HAS UNKNOWNWORD . I WOULD LIKE TO BELIEVE THAT ISRAEL'S SUCCESS HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD BY AMERICA , ISRAEL'S NATURAL PARTNER AND ALLY , AND BY ITS SUPPORTERS HERE AND THE WORLD OVER - SEVERAL THOUSAND OF WHICH ARE HERE TODAY . BUT THE TESTS CONTINUE - WITH HAMAS AND HEZBOLLAH , IN THE ANTI-SEMITISM SO UNKNOWNWORD IN THE ARAB PRESS , IN THE UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE IN IRAQ AND ELSEWHERE , AND IN THE UNKNOWNWORD THREATS ISSUED UNKNOWNWORD BY THE IRANIAN PRESIDENT . "BUT ISRAEL WILL SURVIVE . JUST AS IT HAS UNKNOWNWORD IN THE FACE OF UNKNOWNWORD AND TERRORISTS , JUST AS IT HAS PROSPERED IN THE MOST DANGEROUS NEIGHBORHOOD ON EARTH , SO WILL IT SUCCEED IN THE FACE OF TODAY'S THREATS . THERE WILL ALWAYS , ALWAYS BE AN ISRAEL . "AND JUST AS THERE WILL ALWAYS BE A PROUD , STRONG ISRAEL , SO TOO WILL THERE ALWAYS BE A CLOSE AND ENDURING UNKNOWNWORD RELATIONSHIP . WHEN IT COMES TO THE DEFENSE OF ISRAEL , WE SIMPLY CANNOT COMPROMISE . IN VIEW OF THE INCREASED THREATS TO UNKNOWNWORD SECURITY , AMERICAN SUPPORT FOR ISRAEL SHOULD UNKNOWNWORD - TO INCLUDE PROVIDING NEEDED MILITARY EQUIPMENT AND TECHNOLOGY AND ENSURING THAT ISRAEL UNKNOWNWORD ITS UNKNOWNWORD MILITARY EDGE . ISRAEL'S ENEMIES ARE TOO NUMEROUS , ITS UNKNOWNWORD OF ERROR TOO SMALL , AND OUR SHARED INTERESTS AND VALUES TOO GREAT FOR ANY OTHER POSITION . UNKNOWNWORD STRENGTH WILL BE PUT TO THE TEST . THE WORLD'S CHIEF STATE SPONSOR OF INTERNATIONAL TERRORISM , IRAN , DEFINES ITSELF BY UNKNOWNWORD TO ISRAEL AND THE UNITED STATES . IT IS SIMPLY TRAGIC THAT MILLENNIA OF PROUD UNKNOWNWORD HISTORY HAVE UNKNOWNWORD IN A GOVERNMENT TODAY THAT CANNOT BE UNKNOWNWORD AMONG THOSE OF THE WORLD'S CIVILIZED NATIONS . WHEN THE PRESIDENT OF IRAN CALLS FOR ISRAEL TO BE WIPED OFF OF THE MAP , OR ASKS FOR A WORLD WITHOUT UNKNOWNWORD , OR SUGGESTS THAT ISRAEL'S JEWISH POPULATION RETURN TO EUROPE , OR CALLS THE HOLOCAUST A MYTH , IT IS CLEAR THAT WE ARE DEALING WITH AN EVIL MAN AND A VERY DANGEROUS REGIME . UNKNOWNWORD CONTINUED PURSUIT OF NUCLEAR WEAPONS UNKNOWNWORD POSES AN UNACCEPTABLE RISK . PROTECTED BY A NUCLEAR ARSENAL , IRAN WOULD FEEL UNKNOWNWORD TO SPONSOR TERRORIST ATTACKS AGAINST ANY PERCEIVED ENEMY . ITS UNKNOWNWORD OF THE NUCLEAR NONPROLIFERATION TREATY WOULD UNKNOWNWORD THAT REGIME UNKNOWNWORD , AND COULD INDUCE UNKNOWNWORD , UNKNOWNWORD , SAUDI ARABIA AND OTHERS TO UNKNOWNWORD THEIR DEFENSE UNKNOWNWORD . MODERATE UNKNOWNWORD STATES WOULD HAVE TO ACCOMMODATE THE NEW REALITY , AND THE WORLD WOULD LIVE , UNKNOWNWORD , WITH THE POSSIBILITY THAT UNKNOWNWORD MIGHT PASS NUCLEAR MATERIALS OR WEAPONS TO ONE OF ITS UNKNOWNWORD TERRORIST NETWORKS . UNKNOWNWORD WITH ITS UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD ARSENAL , AN IRANIAN NUCLEAR CAPABILITY WOULD POSE AN IMMEDIATE AND UNKNOWNWORD THREAT TO THE STATE OF ISRAEL . UNKNOWNWORD SECURITY COUNCIL ACTION IS REQUIRED TO IMPOSE UNKNOWNWORD TOUGHER POLITICAL AND ECONOMIC SANCTIONS . SHOULD THE SECURITY COUNCIL CONTINUE TO DRAG ITS FEET , THE U.S . MUST LEAD A GROUP OF UNKNOWNWORD COUNTRIES IN IMPOSING UNKNOWNWORD SANCTIONS OUTSIDE THE UN UNKNOWNWORD . IRAN'S NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD GASOLINE , TO UNKNOWNWORD ONE EXAMPLE , SUGGESTS AN IMPORTANT VULNERABILITY . AND COUNTRIES SUCH AS CHINA AND MALAYSIA , WHICH HAVE SIGNED DEALS TO DEVELOP IRANIAN GAS FIELDS , AND RUSSIA , WHICH PROVIDES WEAPONS SYSTEMS TO UNKNOWNWORD , SHOULD KNOW THAT IRAN WILL BE A CRITICAL ELEMENT IN AMERICAN'S BILATERAL RELATIONS WITH EACH NATION . IN THE MEANTIME , THE U.S . SHOULD IMMEDIATELY UNKNOWNWORD WHETHER ANY OF THESE DEALS UNKNOWNWORD THE TERMS OF LAST UNKNOWNWORD IRAN FREEDOM SUPPORT ACT . "THE U.S . SHOULD ALSO UNKNOWNWORD THE SANCTIONS EFFORT BY UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD CAMPAIGN . BY UNKNOWNWORD INDIVIDUALS , PENSION FUNDS , AND FINANCIAL INSTITUTIONS TO UNKNOWNWORD FROM COMPANIES DOING BUSINESS WITH IRAN , WE CAN ISOLATE AND UNKNOWNWORD A HOSTILE GOVERNMENT . WE WILL ALSO , AS WE DID WITH THE SOUTH AFRICA UNKNOWNWORD CAMPAIGN , INCREASE THE DEBATE INSIDE THE COUNTRY ABOUT WHETHER THE PRESENT COURSE SERVES THE INTERESTS OF THE IRANIAN PEOPLE OR MERELY THOSE OF A MISGUIDED UNKNOWNWORD . AMERICANS AND ALL PROPONENTS OF FREEDOM NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD THE MILLIONS OF IRANIANS WHO ASPIRE TO UNKNOWNWORD THAT WE SUPPORT THEIR UNKNOWNWORD FOR FREEDOM AND DEMOCRACY . "AND EVERY OPTION MUST REMAIN ON THE TABLE . MILITARY ACTION ISN'T OUR UNKNOWNWORD . IT REMAINS , AS IT ALWAYS MUST , THE LAST OPTION . WE HAVE SOME WAY TO GO DIPLOMATICALLY BEFORE WE NEED TO UNKNOWNWORD OTHER MEASURES . BUT IT IS A SIMPLE UNKNOWNWORD OF REALITY THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE THING WORSE THAN A MILITARY SOLUTION , AND THAT , MY FRIENDS , IS A NUCLEAR ARMED IRAN . THE REGIME MUST UNDERSTAND THAT IT CANNOT WIN A UNKNOWNWORD WITH THE WORLD . UNKNOWNWORD , THE LEADERSHIP OF HAMAS MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD . THE UNKNOWNWORD PEOPLE ARE UNKNOWNWORD BY A UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT THAT UNKNOWNWORD TO RECOGNIZE ISRAEL'S RIGHT TO EXIST , UNKNOWNWORD TO UNKNOWNWORD VIOLENCE , AND UNKNOWNWORD TO ACKNOWLEDGE UNKNOWNWORD PEACE COMMITMENTS . THE UNITED STATES CANNOT HAVE UNKNOWNWORD RELATIONS WITH SUCH A GOVERNMENT , ONE THAT UNKNOWNWORD TARGETS INNOCENT UNKNOWNWORD CIVILIANS IN AN ATTEMPT TO UNKNOWNWORD THE JEWISH POPULATION . "THE RECENT TALKS BETWEEN THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT AND THE GOVERNMENT LED BY PRESIDENT UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD IN THE WEST BANK ARE ENCOURAGING , AND THE UNITED STATES SHOULD SUPPORT THIS EFFORT . WE ALSO MUST ENSURE THAT ISRAEL'S PEOPLE CAN LIVE IN SAFETY UNTIL A UNKNOWNWORD LEADERSHIP TRULY COMMITTED TO PEACE UNKNOWNWORD . NO MORAL NATION - NEITHER ISRAEL NOR AMERICA - CAN ALLOW TERRORISTS TO CHART THE POLITICAL COURSE OF ITS PEOPLE . "AND TO SPEAK OF TERRORISM IS ALSO TO SPEAK OF HEZBOLLAH . ISRAEL'S CHANCE FOR ENDURING PEACE WITH LEBANON RESIDES IN A GOVERNMENT THAT HAS A UNKNOWNWORD ON AUTHORITY WITHIN ITS COUNTRY . THAT MEANS NO INDEPENDENT UNKNOWNWORD , NO HEZBOLLAH FIGHTERS , NO WEAPONS AND EQUIPMENT UNKNOWNWORD TO HEZBOLLAH . YET NEITHER THE UNKNOWNWORD ARMY NOR THE INTERNATIONAL FORCE THERE IS PREPARED OR WILLING TO TAKE ON HEZBOLLAH . SO LONG AS THAT IS THE CASE , THE CURRENT UNKNOWNWORD IS LIKELY TO ENABLE HEZBOLLAH TO REGROUP , UNKNOWNWORD , AND UNKNOWNWORD . THERE IS ONE BOTTOM LINE : TO ACHIEVE LASTING PEACE , SOONER OR LATER , ONE WAY OR ANOTHER , HEZBOLLAH MUST BE UNKNOWNWORD . UNKNOWNWORD LET ME TURN UNKNOWNWORD TO IRAQ . WE HAVE MADE A GREAT MANY MISTAKES IN THIS WAR , AND BOTH BAGHDAD AND WASHINGTON REMAIN DIVIDED ABOUT HOW TO UNKNOWNWORD THEM . THE SITUATION IN IRAQ IS VERY DIFFICULT , AND THE TEMPTATION IS TO UNKNOWNWORD OUR HANDS OF A UNKNOWNWORD SITUATION . TO FOLLOW THIS UNKNOWNWORD , HOWEVER , UNKNOWNWORD CATASTROPHE , FOR IRAQ , ISRAEL , AND THE UNITED STATES . UNKNOWNWORD A UNKNOWNWORD AMERICAN WITHDRAWAL RISKS UNKNOWNWORD CIVIL WAR AND THE EMERGENCE OF A FAILED STATE IN THE HEART OF THE MIDDLE EAST , UNKNOWNWORD INTERVENTION FROM IRAQ'S NEIGHBORS AND THE POTENTIAL FOR UNKNOWNWORD CONFLICT , WE MUST DO ALL IN OUR POWER TO PREVAIL . THIS MEANS SUPPORTING GENERAL PETRAEUS AS HE LEADS OUR TROOPS IN COUNTERINSURGENCY OPERATIONS DESIGNED TO CLEAR AREAS OF TERRORISTS AND BRING SECURITY TO THE POPULATION . IT ALSO MEANS PRESSING THE UNKNOWNWORD GOVERNMENT TO MAKE POLITICAL PROGRESS , WHICH HAS BEEN UNKNOWNWORD LACKING . THE IRAQI GOVERNMENT MUST SEIZE THE OPPORTUNITY THAT HAS BEEN PROVIDED IT BY THE "SURGE " IN U.S . FORCES AND MAKE BOLD STEPS ON RECONCILIATION . IT WILL NOT COME AROUND AGAIN . UNKNOWNWORD IRAQ FROM FALLING INTO THE HANDS OF TERRORISTS AND EXTREMISTS IS ONLY NATURAL FOR THE UNITED STATES , AND UNKNOWNWORD FROM THE SAME INTERESTS AND VALUES THAT UNKNOWNWORD OUR CLOSE RELATIONSHIP WITH THE STATE OF ISRAEL . VIOLENT ISLAMIC EXTREMISTS WOULD HAVE US BELIEVE THAT THERE IS ONLY ONE ACCEPTABLE RELIGIOUS PRACTICE , AND THAT THOSE WHO UNKNOWNWORD FROM IT ARE NOT ENTITLED TO LIFE OR LIBERTY . THEY ARE WRONG , VERY , VERY WRONG . "IF AMERICA STANDS FOR ANYTHING , IT STANDS FOR THE FREEDOM TO FOLLOW OUR OWN MINDS AND HEARTS , TO DETERMINE OUR OWN RELATIONSHIP WITH GOD . I DID NOT REALIZE JUST HOW PRECIOUS THIS FREEDOM IS UNTIL IT WAS TAKEN AWAY . AS SOME IN THIS AUDIENCE MAY KNOW , I SPENT SEVERAL YEARS AS A UNKNOWNWORD OF WAR , A TIME WHEN ALL MY FREEDOMS WERE UNKNOWNWORD . AND YET IT WAS MY VERY FAITH IN A SUPREME BEING THAT UNKNOWNWORD ME AND UNKNOWNWORD ME WHILE AT THE HANDS OF MY CAPTORS . "OUR FOUNDERS BUILT IN THIS NATION AN UNKNOWNWORD THING - A DEMOCRACY THAT GUARANTEES THE RIGHT OF EVERY CITIZEN TO WORSHIP GOD IN THE WAY THAT THEY CHOOSE . WE MUST PROTECT THAT FREEDOM HERE IN OUR OWN COUNTRY BY ENSURING THAT JUDGES DO NOT LEGISLATE FROM THE BENCH TO REMOVE RELIGION FROM THE PUBLIC UNKNOWNWORD OF OUR COMMUNITIES . AND WE MUST SUPPORT ITS EXPANSION ABROAD BY STANDING WITH THOSE WHOM , BECAUSE OF THEIR RELIGION AND THEIR VALUES , COME UNDER THREAT . "IT IS EVIDENT THAT I AM SPEAKING , ONCE AGAIN , OF ISRAEL . THE BOND BETWEEN AMERICA AND ISRAEL IS NOT JUST A STRATEGIC ONE , THOUGH THAT IS IMPORTANT . THE MORE PROFOUND TIE BETWEEN OUR TWO COUNTRIES IS A MORAL ONE . WE ARE TWO UNKNOWNWORD WHOSE ALLIANCE IS UNKNOWNWORD IN OUR COMMON VALUES . TO BE PROUDLY UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD IS NOT TO HOLD UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD . IT IS ABOUT DEFENDING THE PRINCIPLES THAT BOTH COUNTRIES HOLD DEAR . THAT IS WHY TODAY I STAND AS I BELIEVE SO MANY OF YOU DO : A CHRISTIAN , PROUDLY UNKNOWNWORD AND PROUDLY UNKNOWNWORD ."
RED	UNKNOWNWORD . PRESIDENT , WE HAVE NEARLY FINISHED THIS LITTLE UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH WAS UNKNOWNWORD , I ASSUME , FOR THE BENEFIT OF A UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD PRESS CORPS AND IN UNKNOWNWORD TO POLITICAL UNKNOWNWORD OPPOSED TO THE WAR WHO HAVE COME TO EXPECT FROM CONGRESS SUCH UNKNOWNWORD , EMPTY THOUGH THEY MAY BE , AS UNKNOWNWORD THAT THE MAJORITY IN THE SENATE HAS HEARD THEIR DEMANDS FOR ACTION TO END THE WAR IN IRAQ . THE OUTCOME OF THIS DEBATE , THE VOTE WE ARE ABOUT TO TAKE , HAS NEVER BEEN IN DOUBT TO A SINGLE MEMBER OF THIS BODY . AND TO STATE THE OBVIOUS , NOTHING WE HAVE DONE FOR THE LAST UNKNOWNWORD HOURS WILL HAVE CHANGED ANY FACTS ON THE GROUND IN IRAQ OR MADE THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR ANY MORE OR LESS IMPORTANT TO THE SECURITY OF OUR COUNTRY . THE STAKES IN THIS WAR REMAIN AS HIGH TODAY AS THEY WERE YESTERDAY ; THE CONSEQUENCES OF AN AMERICAN DEFEAT ARE JUST AS GRAVE ; THE COSTS OF SUCCESS JUST AS DEAR . NO BATTLE WILL HAVE BEEN WON OR LOST , NO ENEMY WILL HAVE BEEN CAPTURED OR KILLED , NO GROUND WILL HAVE BEEN TAKEN OR SURRENDERED , NO SOLDIER WILL HAVE UNKNOWNWORD OR BEEN UNKNOWNWORD , DIED OR COME HOME BECAUSE WE SPENT AN ENTIRE NIGHT DELIVERING OUR UNKNOWNWORD MESSAGE POINTS , UNKNOWNWORD OUR SOUNDBITES , UNKNOWNWORD WITH EACH OTHER , AND UNKNOWNWORD OUR UNKNOWNWORD UNKNOWNWORD FOR STATESMANSHIP . ALL WE HAVE ACHIEVED ARE UNKNOWNWORD SIMILAR NEWSPAPER ACCOUNTS OF OUR UNKNOWNWORD SENSE OF THE UNKNOWNWORD OF THIS DISPLAY AND OUR OWN TEMPORARY PHYSICAL UNKNOWNWORD . TOMORROW THE PRESS WILL MOVE ON TO OTHER THINGS AND WE WILL BE BETTER UNKNOWNWORD . BUT NOTHING ELSE WILL HAVE CHANGED . UNKNOWNWORD IRAQ , AMERICAN SOLDIERS , MARINES , SAILORS AND AIRMEN ARE STILL FIGHTING BRAVELY AND TENACIOUSLY IN BATTLES THAT ARE AS DANGEROUS , DIFFICULT AND CONSEQUENTIAL AS THE GREAT BATTLES OF OUR ARMED FORCES ' STORIED PAST . OUR ENEMIES WILL STILL BE INTENT ON DEFEATING US , AND USING OUR DEFEAT TO ENCOURAGE THEIR UNKNOWNWORD IN THE JIHAD THEY WAGE AGAINST US , A WAR WHICH WILL BECOME A GREATER THREAT TO US SHOULD WE QUIT THE CENTRAL BATTLEFIELD IN DEFEAT . THE MIDDLE EAST WILL STILL BE A UNKNOWNWORD , WHICH OUR DEFEAT COULD UNKNOWNWORD IN A REGIONAL WAR THAT WILL IMPERIL OUR VITAL INTERESTS AT RISK THERE AND DRAW US INTO A LONGER AND FAR MORE COSTLY WAR . THE PROSPECT OF GENOCIDE IN IRAQ , IN WHICH WE WILL BE MORALLY COMPLICIT , IS STILL AS REAL A CONSEQUENCE OF OUR WITHDRAWAL TODAY AS IT WAS YESTERDAY . UNKNOWNWORD OUR EXTENDED DEBATE OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS , I HAVE HEARD SENATORS UNKNOWNWORD CERTAIN ARGUMENTS OVER AND OVER AGAIN . MY FRIENDS ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THIS ARGUMENT UNKNOWNWORD THOSE OF US WHO OPPOSE THIS AMENDMENT WITH ADVOCATING UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE ," WHICH IS INTENDED TO SUGGEST THAT WE ARE INTENT ON CONTINUING THE MISTAKES THAT HAVE PUT THE OUTCOME OF THE WAR IN DOUBT . YET WE ALL KNOW THAT WITH THE UNKNOWNWORD OF GENERAL PETRAEUS WE HAVE CHANGED COURSE . WE ARE NOW FIGHTING A COUNTERINSURGENCY STRATEGY , WHICH SOME OF US HAVE ARGUED WE SHOULD HAVE BEEN FOLLOWING FROM THE BEGINNING , AND WHICH MAKES THE MOST EFFECTIVE USE OF OUR STRENGTH AND DOES NOT STRENGTHEN THE TACTICS OF OUR ENEMY . THIS NEW BATTLE PLAN IS SUCCEEDING WHERE OUR PREVIOUS TACTICS HAVE FAILED , ALTHOUGH THE OUTCOME REMAINS FAR FROM CERTAIN . THE TACTICS PROPOSED IN THE AMENDMENT OFFERED BY MY FRIENDS , SENATORS UNKNOWNWORD AND UNKNOWNWORD - A SMALLER FORCE , CONFINED TO UNKNOWNWORD DISTANT FROM THE BATTLEFIELD , FROM WHERE THEY WILL LAUNCH UNKNOWNWORD SEARCH AND DESTROY UNKNOWNWORD AND TRAIN THE IRAQI MILITARY - ARE PRECISELY THE TACTICS UNKNOWNWORD FOR MOST OF THIS WAR AND WHICH HAVE , BY UNKNOWNWORD ACCOUNT , FAILED UNKNOWNWORD . NOW , THAT , MR . PRESIDENT , IS UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE , AND IT IS A COURSE THAT UNKNOWNWORD LEADS TO OUR DEFEAT AND THE CATASTROPHIC CONSEQUENCES FOR IRAQ , THE REGION AND THE SECURITY OF THE UNITED STATES OUR DEFEAT WOULD UNKNOWNWORD . "YES , WE HAVE HEARD QUITE A LOT ABOUT THE UNKNOWNWORD OF UNKNOWNWORD THE COURSE ," THOUGH THE REAL OUTCOME SHOULD THIS AMENDMENT PREVAIL AND BE SIGNED INTO LAW , WOULD BE TO DENY OUR UNKNOWNWORD AND THE AMERICANS THEY HAVE THE HONOR TO COMMAND THE ABILITY TO TRY , IN THIS LATE HOUR , TO ADDRESS THE UNKNOWNWORD THESE TRIED AND FAILED TACTICS PRODUCED , AND SALVAGE FROM THE WRECKAGE OF OUR PREVIOUS FAILURES A MEASURE OF STABILITY FOR IRAQ AND THE MIDDLE EAST , AND A MORE SECURE FUTURE FOR THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . "I HAVE ALSO LISTENED TO MY COLLEAGUES ON THE OTHER SIDE REPEATEDLY REMIND US THAT THE AMERICAN PEOPLE HAVE SPOKEN IN THE LAST ELECTION . THEY HAVE DEMANDED WE WITHDRAW FROM IRAQ , AND IT IS OUR RESPONSIBILITY TO DO , AS QUICKLY AS POSSIBLE , WHAT THEY HAVE BID US TO DO . BUT IS THAT OUR PRIMARY RESPONSIBILITY ? REALLY , MR . PRESIDENT , IS THAT HOW WE CONSTRUE OUR ROLE : TO FOLLOW WITHOUT QUESTION POPULAR OPINION EVEN IF WE BELIEVE IT TO BE IN ERROR , AND LIKELY TO ENDANGER THE SECURITY OF THE COUNTRY WE HAVE UNKNOWNWORD TO DEFEND ? SURELY , WE MUST BE RESPONSIVE TO THE PEOPLE WHO HAVE ELECTED US TO OFFICE , AND WHO , IF IT IS THEIR WISH , WILL REMOVE US WHEN THEY BECOME UNKNOWNWORD WITH OUR FAILURE TO HEED THEIR DEMANDS . I UNDERSTAND THAT , OF COURSE . AND I UNDERSTAND WHY SO MANY AMERICANS HAVE BECOME SICK AND TIRED OF THIS WAR , GIVEN THE MANY , MANY MISTAKES MADE BY CIVILIAN AND MILITARY LEADERS IN ITS UNKNOWNWORD . I , TOO , HAVE BEEN MADE SICK AT HEART BY THESE MISTAKES AND THE TERRIBLE PRICE WE HAVE PAID FOR THEM . BUT I CANNOT REACT TO THESE MISTAKES BY EMBRACING A COURSE OF ACTION THAT I KNOW WILL BE AN EVEN GREATER MISTAKE , A MISTAKE OF COLOSSAL HISTORICAL PROPORTIONS , WHICH WILL -- AND I AM AS SURE OF THIS AS I AM OF ANYTHING - SERIOUSLY ENDANGER THE PEOPLE I REPRESENT AND THE COUNTRY I HAVE SERVED ALL MY ADULT LIFE . I HAVE MANY RESPONSIBILITIES TO THE PEOPLE OF ARIZONA , AND TO ALL AMERICANS . I TAKE THEM ALL SERIOUSLY , MR . PRESIDENT , OR TRY TO . BUT I HAVE ONE RESPONSIBILITY THAT OUTWEIGHS ALL THE OTHERS - AND THAT IS TO DO EVERYTHING IN MY POWER , TO USE WHATEVER MEAGER TALENTS I UNKNOWNWORD , AND EVERY RESOURCE GOD HAS GRANTED ME TO PROTECT THE SECURITY OF THIS GREAT AND GOOD NATION FROM ALL ENEMIES FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC . AND THAT I INTEND TO DO , MR . PRESIDENT , EVEN IF I MUST STAND ATHWART POPULAR OPINION . I WILL EXPLAIN MY REASONS TO THE AMERICAN PEOPLE . I WILL ATTEMPT TO CONVINCE AS MANY OF MY COUNTRYMEN AS I CAN THAT WE MUST SHOW EVEN GREATER PATIENCE , THOUGH OUR PATIENCE IS NEARLY EXHAUSTED , AND THAT AS LONG AS THERE IS A PROSPECT FOR NOT LOSING THIS WAR , THEN WE MUST NOT CHOOSE TO LOSE IT . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUE MY RESPONSIBILITY TO MY UNKNOWNWORD AND MY COUNTRY . THAT IS HOW I CONSTRUED IT YESTERDAY . IT IS HOW I CONSTRUE IT TODAY . AND IT IS HOW I WILL CONSTRUE IT TOMORROW . I DO NOT KNOW HOW I COULD CHOOSE ANY OTHER COURSE . "I CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT I POSSESS THE SKILLS TO BE UNKNOWNWORD . I CANNOT BE CERTAIN THAT EVEN IF I COULD CONVINCE AMERICANS TO GIVE GENERAL PETRAEUS THE TIME HE NEEDS TO DETERMINE WHETHER WE CAN PREVAIL , THAT WE WILL PREVAIL IN IRAQ . ALL I AM CERTAIN OF IS THAT OUR DEFEAT THERE WOULD BE CATASTROPHIC , NOT JUST FOR IRAQ , BUT FOR US , AND THAT I CANNOT BE COMPLICIT IN IT , BUT MUST DO WHATEVER I CAN , WHETHER I AM EFFECTIVE OR NOT , TO HELP US TRY TO AVERT IT . THAT , MR . PRESIDENT , IS ALL I CAN POSSIBLY OFFER MY COUNTRY AT THIS TIME . IT IS NOT MUCH COMPARED TO THE SACRIFICES MADE BY AMERICANS WHO HAVE VOLUNTEERED TO SHOULDER A RIFLE AND FIGHT THIS WAR FOR US . I KNOW THAT , AND AM HUMBLED BY IT , AS WE ALL ARE . BUT THOUGH MY DUTY IS NEITHER DANGEROUS NOR ONEROUS , IT COMPELS ME NONETHELESS TO SAY TO MY COLLEAGUES AND TO ALL AMERICANS WHO DISAGREE WITH ME : THAT AS LONG AS WE HAVE A CHANCE TO SUCCEED WE MUST TRY TO SUCCEED . "I AM PRIVILEGED , AS WE ALL ARE , TO BE SUBJECT TO THE JUDGMENT OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE AND HISTORY . BUT , MY FRIENDS , THEY ARE NOT ALWAYS THE SAME JUDGMENT . THE VERDICT OF THE PEOPLE WILL UNKNOWNWORD LONG BEFORE HISTORY'S . I AM UNLIKELY TO EVER KNOW HOW HISTORY HAS UNKNOWNWORD US IN THIS HOUR . THE PUBLIC'S JUDGMENT OF ME I WILL KNOW SOON ENOUGH . I WILL ACCEPT IT , AS I MUST . BUT WHETHER IT IS UNKNOWNWORD OR UNKNOWNWORD , I WILL STAND WHERE I STAND , AND TAKE UNKNOWNWORD FROM MY CONFIDENCE THAT I TOOK MY RESPONSIBILITIES TO MY COUNTRY SERIOUSLY , AND DESPITE THE MISTAKES I HAVE MADE AS A PUBLIC SERVANT AND THE FLAWS I HAVE AS AN ADVOCATE , I TRIED AS BEST I COULD TO HELP THE COUNTRY WE ALL LOVE REMAIN AS SAFE AS SHE COULD BE IN AN HOUR OF SERIOUS PERIL ."
